Also these predictions were recently confirmed by numerical simulations~\\cite{Caselle:2010zs, Gliozzi:2010jh}. \n\nUntil now, the predictions of the effective string model for the width of confining flux tubes have always been confirmed by numerical lattice results. In this work, however, we will show that the ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ lattice gauge theory in three dimensions provides a significant exception to this rule of thumb. More precisely, we will demonstrate that the standard string picture does not provide a good low-energy description for this model, and that sizeable deviations from eq.~(\\ref{f1}) can be observed in lattice simulations of this theory.\\footnote{Although the flux-tube width in this lattice theory has been studied numerically since the 1980's~\\cite{Sterling:1983fs}, the computing-power limitations of the time did not allow one to reach the level of precision required for a detailed quantitative comparison with the theoretical model.} Na\\\"{\\i}vely, one could suspect that this mismatch is just due to the fact that the effective string description of the confining flux tube holds only for interquark distances larger than $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$. However, we will show that this is not the case, and that the disagreement has a more subtle explanation. \n\nThe fact that compact ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ lattice gauge theory in three dimensions (3D) exhibits a behavior different from other confining theories should not come as a surprise. This model, which has been investigated analytically since forty years ago~\\cite{Polyakov:1976fu, Banks:1977cc, Drell:1978hr, Gopfert:1981er}, has the interesting property that two characteristic non-perturbative, dimension-$1$ quantities, namely $m_0$ (the mass of the lightest ``glueball'') and $\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ (the square root of the asymptotic slope of the potential $V(R)$ associated with two static charges at a distance $R$ from each other), scale differently with the coupling $e$---or, equivalently, with the lattice spacing $a$---of the lattice theory.\\footnote{Note that this is a property of the lattice theory at finite spacing, it does \\emph{not} mean that the continuum theory is characterized by two independent scales.} This can be contrasted with the behavior of ${\\mathrm{SU}}(N)$ lattice gauge theories, in which the dependence of the $m_0/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ ratio on the  value of the coupling is a very mild one (and simply due to discretization artifacts that vanish in the continuum limit). As discussed in our previous publication~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}, this peculiar property of compact ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ lattice gauge theory in 3D has a direct counterpart at the level of the effective string model describing its long-distance physics, whose action includes an extrinsic-curvature contribution~\\cite{Orland:1994qt}, besides the usual Nambu-Got\\={o} term. The extrinsic-curvature term means that the flux tube vibrates like a ``rigid'' string~\\cite{Caselle:2014nta}; the presence of contributions of this type (which are compatible with Lorentz symmetry~\\cite{Aharony:2011gb}) also in the effective string action for ${\\mathrm{SU}}(N)$ gauge theories is not ruled out \\emph{a priori}; however, numerically, it seems to be hard to detect, within the precision of state-of-the-art lattice studies~\\cite{Brandt:2013eua}. The fact, that in compact lattice QED in 3D the effect of extrinsic-curvature terms can have a sizeable impact on the infrared dynamics, makes this theory particularly attractive for numerical studies of the confining string model~\\cite{Vadacchino:2013baa}. This motivated the analysis of the confining potential in this theory, that we reported in refs.~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka, Vadacchino:2014ota}. In the present work, we extend this investigation to the width and the profile of the flux tube.\n\nComing back to eq.~(\\ref{f1}), our lack of knowledge about the flux-tube dynamics at short distances is encoded in the $R_0$ parameter, which cannot be predicted from the string model alone, and sets a lower bound on the distances at which the effective string description is expected to hold. In the effective string model, the flux tube is idealized as a one-dimensional object, whose typical width is purely due to quantum fluctuations. However, a more realistic picture of the flux tube may include a core of finite radius, whose size defines an ``intrinsic width'' of the flux tube.\n\nThe importance of this intrinsic width can be appreciated by probing the shape of the flux tube (by monitoring some local observable like, e.g., the field strength) along the transverse directions: moving from the axis joining the color sources to larger and larger transverse distances, the effective string picture predicts a Gau{\\ss}ian profile, but the results of Monte~Carlo simulations reveal significant deviations from this idealized shape. Intriguingly, however, the second moment of the distribution is fully consistent with eq.~(\\ref{f1}), if $R>R_0$.\n\nA different way to model the flux tube in confining gauge theories is based on the dual-superconductor picture---an idea that can be traced back to seminal works by Nambu~\\cite{Nambu:1974zg}, by 't~Hooft~\\cite{'tHooft:1979uj} and by Mandelstam~\\cite{Mandelstam:1974pi} (see ref.~\\cite{Baker:1991bc} for a review and refs.~\\cite{Cea:1992sd, Cea:1992vx, Cea:1993pi, Cea:1994ed, Cea:1994aj, Cea:1995zt, Cea:1995ga, Cardoso:2013lla, Amado:2013rja, Cardaci:2010tb, Cea:2012qw, Cea:2014uja} for comparisons with Monte~Carlo simulations). In this framework, quark confinement is associated with condensation of chromomagnetic monopoles, in analogy with Cooper-pair condensation in superconductors, so that the flux tube is expected to behave as a (dual) Abrikosov vortex. In contrast to the effective string model, the dual-superconductor picture predicts that the flux density decreases exponentially with the distance from the interquark axis (the associated  characteristic length scale being the analogue of the ``penetration length'' of Abrikosov vortices in a superconductor) and, more importantly, that it does not depend on the interquark distance $R$. These features can be easily associated with the rigid core mentioned above, with the penetration length playing the r\\^ole of the intrinsic width. \n\nIn the past few years there have been some attempts to combine the two pictures into one framework, merging an Abrikosov-like short-distance description of the flux-tube core with a long-distance effective string description of its quantum fluctuations~\\cite{Cardoso:2013lla, Amado:2013rja}. This requires constructing an expression for the flux-tube shape, which should interpolate between the Gau{\\ss}ian behavior predicted by the effective string and the exponential decrease predicted by the dual-superconductivity model. This interpolation can be carried out without arbitrary assumptions, when the physics allows one to use some additional theoretical tools. For example, it is known that in the presence of a continuous thermal deconfinement transition, the long-distance properties of a gauge theory should be described by a lower-dimensional spin model~\\cite{Svetitsky:1982gs}: taking advantage of this, in refs.~\\cite{Caselle:2006wr, Caselle:2012rp} the analytical study of the flux-tube width in LGTs in three dimensions was mapped to a problem in perturbed conformal field theory in two dimensions. Another theoretical tool, that can be used to study the flux-tube profile (at least in the strong-coupling limit) is the holographic correspondence~\\cite{Maldacena:1997re, Gubser:1998bc, Witten:1998qj}: this approach was followed in refs.~\\cite{Vyas:2010wg, Giataganas:2015yaa}.\n\nSome recent works tried to work out a model interpolating between the thin-string and the dual-superconductor-tube pictures also at zero (or low) temperature: they are inspired by the dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in superconductivity~\\cite{Cea:2014uja}, or on the convolution of the classical intrinsic-width string behavior with a Gau{\\ss}ian distribution, which should model the quantum oscillations of the flux tube far from its core~\\cite{Cardoso:2013lla}. On the other hand, an interesting alternative proposal to describe the flux-tube shape at low temperature $T$ was inspired by the physics of rough interfaces: in particular, in a series of articles on this subject, M\\\"unster and collaborators derived the interface profile at one loop, in the framework of the renormalized $\\phi^4$ model in three dimensions~\\cite{Munster:1990yg, Klessinger:1992qq, Hoppe:1997ey, Muller:2004vv, Kopf:2008hr}.\n\nAs we will discuss in the following sections, the results of the high-precision Monte~Carlo study that we carried out reveal a wealth of interesting information about the confining flux tube in compact ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ lattice gauge theory in 3D---in particular about its shape (as a function of the distance from the axis of the static sources) and width. Although numerical studies of this type are comparatively challenging, in this work we could reach high precision, thanks to an exact duality transformation of the Kramers-Wannier type~\\cite{Kramers:1941kn, Wegner:1984qt, Cobanera:2011wn, Wegner:2014ixa}, which maps the original gauge theory to a spin model with integer-valued variables and nearest-neighbor interactions only. The main finding of this work is that a bosonic Nambu-Got\\={o} string does not provide a quantitatively fully satisfactory model of flux tubes in this lattice theory (although it captures their main features at the qualitative and semi-quantitative level). Looking at the flux-tube profile at large transverse separations from the sources' axis, we also find that some of its features can be described well in terms of a dual Abrikosov vortex. We remark that, although the theory that we are considering has a finite ultraviolet cutoff (and some of its features---including, in particular, the existence of two independent dimensionful non-perturbative scales $m_0$ and $\\sigma$---depend crucially on the finiteness of $a$), these results provide novel insight into the implications of confinement for the low-energy properties of a theory, and can serve as a guide to a better understanding of confinement in non-Abelian gauge theories in four spacetime dimensions, too.\n\nThe structure of this article is the following: in section~\\ref{sec:simulation_setup}, we introduce the basic definitions of the ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ model in three dimensions and of its lattice regularization, some of its interesting physical properties, and the setup of our Monte~Carlo study of the flux tube in this theory. In section~\\ref{sec:results}, we present and analyze the numerical results of our lattice simulations. Finally, in section~\\ref{sec:discussion_and_concluding_remarks} we summarize the implications of our findings, and point out some concluding remarks. \n\n\\section{Simulation setup}\n\\label{sec:simulation_setup}\n\nThe model we are interested in is compact ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, regularized on a Euclidean, isotropic, cubic lattice $\\Lambda$ of spacing $a$.

During the past few years, significant computational and analytical efforts have been devoted to a more precise characterization of the flux tube. The main reason is that its behavior is deeply related to the underlying confining mechanism and it is hoped that one could shed some light on this issue by studying the physics of the flux tube.\n\nIn particular, there are two seemingly conflicting descriptions for the flux tube, respectively based on an effective string theory (EST) approach and on the dual-superconductor model.

For example, at $\\beta=2.4$ this quantity corresponds to more than eight lattice spacings, while all data (starting from $R\\ge 4a$) can be successfully fitted to eq.~(\\ref{f1new}).\n\nWe also verified that the deviations from the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} prediction cannot be explained by the next-to-leading order effects discussed in refs.~\\cite{Gliozzi:2010zv, Gliozzi:2010zt}. In particular, these effects play a negligible r\\^{o}le at large distances (and cannot account for the strong discrepancy between $s$ and $\\sigma$ that the numerical data reveal); their impact becomes non-negligible at intermediate distances, but their form is clearly incompatible with the simple logarithmic behavior exhibited by our Monte~Carlo results.\n\nAs an alternative explanation for the mismatch between the EST model and the simulation results, one could imagine that the deviations from the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} prediction be due to the presence of extrinsic-curvature terms in the effective string action~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}. However, a complete analytical derivation of the contributions to $w^2$ from such terms is non-trivial, and lies clearly beyond the scope of the present work.\n\nThese results show that the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} string model \\emph{does not} provide an accurate description of flux tubes in this theory.\n\nComparing the fit results in table~\\ref{tab:w2-fitlog} with the values for $\\sigma a^2$ in table~\\ref{tab:simulsetting}, it is also interesting to note that the value of $R_0$ extracted from the fits does not scale like $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$: as the lattice spacing is decreased, the dimensionless product $R_0\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ grows from $0.145(15)$ for $\\beta=1.7$ to $0.256(11)$ at $\\beta=2.4$. Clearly, this is at odds with the expectation that $R_0$ should tend to a well-defined constant value in the continuum limit (as is the case in non-Abelian gauge theories in 4D). Instead, our data give a clear indication that, in this theory, the minimal tube length, below which the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} string description breaks down, is monotonously \\emph{increasing} to larger and larger values for $a \\to 0$.\n\nAnother observation, indicating that $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ is \\emph{not} the ``natural'' physical length scale of this model is shown in fig.~\\ref{fig:collapse_of_data}: our lattice results at different lattice spacing do not fall on a universal curve when expressed in units of $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ (left-hand-side panel), but they do, when they are plotted in units of $1/m_0$ (right-hand-side panel).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htpb]\n\\centering{\n\\includegraphics[height=0.24\\textheight]{{w2sig}.pdf}\\hfill\n\\includegraphics[height=0.24\\textheight]{{w2m02}.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{The lattice results for $w^2$ as a function of $R$ at different values of $\\beta$ (displayed by symbols of different colors: dark blue for $\\beta=1.7$, dark green for $\\beta=2.0$, red for $\\beta=2.2$ and cyan for $\\beta=2.4$) do not fall on a common curve when plotted in units of $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ (l.h.s. panel), while they exhibit a nearly perfect collapse to the same curve, when expressed in units of the inverse of the mass gap $1/m_0$ (r.h.s. panel). Note the logarithmic scale for the horizontal axis.}\n\\label{fig:collapse_of_data}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to get a better understanding of the dynamics of the flux tube, it is useful to directly study its profile. Thanks to the dual algorithm, it is possible to obtain very precise results for this quantity for a broad range of values of $R$, and at large distances from the axis between the sources. The results of this study are presented in the following subsection.\n\n\n\\subsection{Flux-tube profile}\n\\label{subsec:profile}\n\nThe various models of the confining flux tube yield very different predictions for its ``shape''---i.e. for the dependence of the field strength on the transverse separation from the source-source axis.

However, table~\\ref{tab:w2-fitlog} reveals that the fitted value of $s$ is incompatible with the string tension, in contrast with the prediction from the effective string picture (in the Gau{\\ss}ian approximation that we are considering).\n\nThe deviation of $s$ from the string tension can be better appreciated in table~\\ref{tab:s_sigma_m0square}, in which we also compared $s$ with (the square of) the other physical scale of the theory, i.e. the mass gap.

For example, at $\\beta=2.4$ this quantity corresponds to more than eight lattice spacings, while all data (starting from $R\\ge 4a$) can be successfully fitted to eq.~(\\ref{f1new}).\n\nWe also verified that the deviations from the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} prediction cannot be explained by the next-to-leading order effects discussed in refs.~\\cite{Gliozzi:2010zv, Gliozzi:2010zt}. In particular, these effects play a negligible r\\^{o}le at large distances (and cannot account for the strong discrepancy between $s$ and $\\sigma$ that the numerical data reveal); their impact becomes non-negligible at intermediate distances, but their form is clearly incompatible with the simple logarithmic behavior exhibited by our Monte~Carlo results.\n\nAs an alternative explanation for the mismatch between the EST model and the simulation results, one could imagine that the deviations from the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} prediction be due to the presence of extrinsic-curvature terms in the effective string action~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}. However, a complete analytical derivation of the contributions to $w^2$ from such terms is non-trivial, and lies clearly beyond the scope of the present work.\n\nThese results show that the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} string model \\emph{does not} provide an accurate description of flux tubes in this theory.\n\nComparing the fit results in table~\\ref{tab:w2-fitlog} with the values for $\\sigma a^2$ in table~\\ref{tab:simulsetting}, it is also interesting to note that the value of $R_0$ extracted from the fits does not scale like $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$: as the lattice spacing is decreased, the dimensionless product $R_0\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ grows from $0.145(15)$ for $\\beta=1.7$ to $0.256(11)$ at $\\beta=2.4$. Clearly, this is at odds with the expectation that $R_0$ should tend to a well-defined constant value in the continuum limit (as is the case in non-Abelian gauge theories in 4D). Instead, our data give a clear indication that, in this theory, the minimal tube length, below which the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} string description breaks down, is monotonously \\emph{increasing} to larger and larger values for $a \\to 0$.\n\nAnother observation, indicating that $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ is \\emph{not} the ``natural'' physical length scale of this model is shown in fig.~\\ref{fig:collapse_of_data}: our lattice results at different lattice spacing do not fall on a universal curve when expressed in units of $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ (left-hand-side panel), but they do, when they are plotted in units of $1/m_0$ (right-hand-side panel).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htpb]\n\\centering{\n\\includegraphics[height=0.24\\textheight]{{w2sig}.pdf}\\hfill\n\\includegraphics[height=0.24\\textheight]{{w2m02}.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{The lattice results for $w^2$ as a function of $R$ at different values of $\\beta$ (displayed by symbols of different colors: dark blue for $\\beta=1.7$, dark green for $\\beta=2.0$, red for $\\beta=2.2$ and cyan for $\\beta=2.4$) do not fall on a common curve when plotted in units of $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ (l.h.s. panel), while they exhibit a nearly perfect collapse to the same curve, when expressed in units of the inverse of the mass gap $1/m_0$ (r.h.s. panel).

Thanks to the dual algorithm, it is possible to obtain very precise results for this quantity for a broad range of values of $R$, and at large distances from the axis between the sources. The results of this study are presented in the following subsection.\n\n\n\\subsection{Flux-tube profile}\n\\label{subsec:profile}\n\nThe various models of the confining flux tube yield very different predictions for its ``shape''---i.e. for the dependence of the field strength on the transverse separation from the source-source axis. As mentioned in section~\\ref{sec:introduction}, two of the most commonly used models are the one describing the flux tube as a fluctuating bosonic string, and the one based on the interpretation of the vacuum of a confining gauge theory as a dual (color-)superconductor, in which flux tubes are interpreted as ``Abrikosov vortices''.

In addition, the logarithmic dependence on the length of the flux tube persists also for tubes shorter than the characteristic length scale $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$, below which the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} string prediction is not expected to hold anymore. Similarly, the values obtained for $R_0$---that is the length scale, below which eq.~(\\ref{f1}) necessarily breaks down\\footnote{Obviously, eq.~(\\ref{f1}) is meaningful only for $R$ larger than $R_0$; in the opposite range, the logarithm turns negative, and eq.~(\\ref{f1}) would then imply the unphysical result $w^2<0$.}---indicate that, when the lattice spacing $a$ is decreased to sufficiently small values, the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} string model eventually fails to describe the width of any flux tube of fixed length. This discrepancy between the string model and Monte~Carlo data cannot be accommodated invoking higher-order terms derived from the Nambu-Got\\={o} action.\n\nA closer inspection of the flux-tube profile reveals that its decay at large distance from the interquark axis is clearly incompatible with the leading-order EST prediction, while it fully agrees with the predictions of the dual-superconductor model. In particular, the London penetration length is equal to the inverse of the mass of the lightest glueball; remarkably, this holds at all of the $\\beta$ values considered in this work.\n\nThese results reinforce the conclusions of our recent study of the interquark potential in this model~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}, where we found that, as $\\beta$ is increased toward the continuum limit, the behavior of the flux tube shows larger and larger deviations from the prediction of the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} model. The flux-tube width, that we investigated in the present work, exhibits a similar pattern: for example, fitting our Monte~Carlo results for $w^2$ at $\\beta=1.7$ to eq.~(\\ref{f1new}), we obtained a value for $s$ (in lattice units) that is almost compatible with $\\sigma$, but when $\\beta$ is increased the two quantities become more and more  divergent from each other. In ref.~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}, we also observed that, as $\\beta$ is increased, the minimal distance (in \\emph{physical} units), at which the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} model describes the data well, is pushed to larger and large values. Here, the increase of $R_0\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ with $\\beta$, discussed in subsection~\\ref{subsec:profile}, is another facet of the same effect.\n\nIn ref.~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}, we put forward the hypothesis that the deviations from the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} model signal the presence of an extrinsic-curvature term in the effective string action. More precisely, we showed that the results for the confining potential are compatible with such term, if it appears with a coefficient $\\alpha$ proportional to $1/m_0$, so that the $\\alpha/\\sigma$ ratio diverges like $1/m_0^2$ in the continuum limit. The present analysis supports this picture, as the shape of the flux tube and its width depend only on $m_0$---that is, on the coefficient of the extrinsic-curvature term of the effective string action.     \n\nIt is interesting to compare our findings with the results that have been obtained in non-Abelian gauge theories. It should be noted that, in those theories, $m_0/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ is essentially constant (up to small, finite-lattice-spacing corrections): thus the question, whether the flux tube width is a function of $\\sigma$ (which appears as the coefficient of the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} term in the effective string action) or of $m_0$, is not a well-defined one. By contrast, in compact ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ lattice gauge theory in 3D, the issue can be studied in a meaningful way, since in this case \nthe $m_0/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ ratio is strongly dependent on the coupling:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 34603, "prevtext": "\nwhere $C_0$ is independent of $x_t$, and $\\delta^2$ is defined in terms of a sum over the allowed vibration modes of the string~\\cite{Luscher:1980iy}. This relation implies eq.~(\\ref{f1}) (with $w^2=\\delta^2$). In order to test this prediction, we attempted to fit our Monte~Carlo results for the ``tails'' of the $e_l(x_t)$ profile with a Gau{\\ss}ian of the form of eq.~(\\ref{Gaussian}). More precisely, we tried a Gau{\\ss}ian fit of $e_l(x_t)$ for distances from the sources' axis larger than a certain value $x_t^c$. To fix the latter, we started from $x_t^c=0$ and progressively increased its value, until both the following conditions were met:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item the ${\\chi^2_{\\tiny\\mbox{red}}}$ was close to unity, and\n\\item by further increasing $x_t^c$, the fitted parameter values did not change in a statistically significant way. \n\\end{enumerate}\nAn example of the results obtained from this analysis (for $\\beta=2.0$ and interquark distance $R=10a$) is reported in table~\\ref{tab:fit-gauss-ko}: it shows that there exists no distance range in the $e_l(x_t)$ tails, that can be described by a pure Gau{\\ss}ian.

As $m_0/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ is approximately constant, this question cannot be answered by looking at the dependence of the flux-tube width on the interquark distance, but in principle one could address the issue by looking at the flux-tube profile. As figure~\\ref{fig:logElvsz-2.0-16a} shows, in our theory the shape of the flux tube at large distance from the interquark axis is unambiguously described by a simple exponential, as predicted by the equations for a dual superconductor in three spacetime dimensions. Unfortunately, the existing examples of this type of analysis for non-Abelian models (for instance, those reported in ref.~\\cite{Gliozzi:2010zv} for ${\\mathrm{SU}}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in 3D, or in refs.~\\cite{Cea:2014uja, Cardoso:2013lla} for the ${\\mathrm{SU}}(3)$ theory in 4D) are less conclusive, and appear to reveal a mixture of Gau{\\ss}ian and exponential contributions. To get a better picture, it would probably be helpful to address this issue not only numerically but also analytically (for example, by an explicit computation of the flux-tube profile in an effective-string model including an extrinsic-curvature term).\n\nTo summarize, in this work we used the dual formulation of compact ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ gauge theory in 3D to study the transverse shape of the flux tube on the symmetry line between the static sources. The dual formulation of the theory allowed us to reach high numerical precision, without any error-reduction method.\n\nFitting our large-transverse-separation results for the flux-tube profile to the prediction of the dual-superconductor model, we found that the London penetration length is compatible with the inverse of the lightest glueball mass $m_0$, and that this quantity is independent of the distance between the static sources, as expected. This prediction, however, can only fit the tails of flux-tube profile.\n\nThe squared width $w^2$ of the confining flux tube was evaluated directly from the data obtained in our Monte~Carlo simulations, for a wide range of physical separations $R$ between the color charges. We found that, although $w^2$ grows logarithmically with $R$, as predicted by effective string theory, its amplitude is not proportional to $1/\\sigma$ (the inverse of the string tension), but rather to $1/m_0^2$. For non-Abelian Yang-Mills theories in four spacetime dimensions, the ratio of these two dimensionful scales is nearly independent of the lattice spacing (at least at values of the lattice spacing of physical interest, i.e. sufficiently far from the strong-coupling regime), but this is not the case here. In fact, as we already remarked earlier, part of our interest in this lattice model stems precisely from the fact that it allows one to disentangle the dependence of different physical effects on these two scales.\n\nFrom these results one can conclude that in this theory:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the characteristic scale of the flux tube is $1/m_0$ (rather than $1/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$, as one would expect);\n\\item at large enough transverse separation, the profile of the flux tube can be successfully modelled by an exponential decrease, in agreement with the expectations from the dual-superconductor model in 3D.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe investigation of the structure and dynamics of flux tubes in this toy model of confinement, that we carried out in the present work, could provide guidance toward a better understanding of analogous problems also in non-Abelian theories. \n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nThe numerical calculations were carried out on INFN Pisa GRID Data Center machines.

This discrepancy between the string model and Monte~Carlo data cannot be accommodated invoking higher-order terms derived from the Nambu-Got\\={o} action.\n\nA closer inspection of the flux-tube profile reveals that its decay at large distance from the interquark axis is clearly incompatible with the leading-order EST prediction, while it fully agrees with the predictions of the dual-superconductor model. In particular, the London penetration length is equal to the inverse of the mass of the lightest glueball; remarkably, this holds at all of the $\\beta$ values considered in this work.\n\nThese results reinforce the conclusions of our recent study of the interquark potential in this model~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}, where we found that, as $\\beta$ is increased toward the continuum limit, the behavior of the flux tube shows larger and larger deviations from the prediction of the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} model. The flux-tube width, that we investigated in the present work, exhibits a similar pattern: for example, fitting our Monte~Carlo results for $w^2$ at $\\beta=1.7$ to eq.~(\\ref{f1new}), we obtained a value for $s$ (in lattice units) that is almost compatible with $\\sigma$, but when $\\beta$ is increased the two quantities become more and more  divergent from each other. In ref.~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}, we also observed that, as $\\beta$ is increased, the minimal distance (in \\emph{physical} units), at which the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} model describes the data well, is pushed to larger and large values. Here, the increase of $R_0\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ with $\\beta$, discussed in subsection~\\ref{subsec:profile}, is another facet of the same effect.\n\nIn ref.~\\cite{Caselle:2014eka}, we put forward the hypothesis that the deviations from the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} model signal the presence of an extrinsic-curvature term in the effective string action. More precisely, we showed that the results for the confining potential are compatible with such term, if it appears with a coefficient $\\alpha$ proportional to $1/m_0$, so that the $\\alpha/\\sigma$ ratio diverges like $1/m_0^2$ in the continuum limit. The present analysis supports this picture, as the shape of the flux tube and its width depend only on $m_0$---that is, on the coefficient of the extrinsic-curvature term of the effective string action.     \n\nIt is interesting to compare our findings with the results that have been obtained in non-Abelian gauge theories. It should be noted that, in those theories, $m_0/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ is essentially constant (up to small, finite-lattice-spacing corrections): thus the question, whether the flux tube width is a function of $\\sigma$ (which appears as the coefficient of the Nambu-Got{\\={o}} term in the effective string action) or of $m_0$, is not a well-defined one. By contrast, in compact ${\\mathrm{U}}(1)$ lattice gauge theory in 3D, the issue can be studied in a meaningful way, since in this case \nthe $m_0/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ ratio is strongly dependent on the coupling:\n\n", "index": 23, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ratio_m0_1}\n\\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{\\sigma}} \\simeq \\frac{2\\pi c_0}{\\sqrt{c_\\sigma}} (2\\pi\\beta)^{3/4} e^{-\\frac{\\pi^2}{2} v(0)\\beta},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E12.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{m_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma}}\\simeq\\frac{2\\pi c_{0}}{\\sqrt{c_{\\sigma}}}(2\\pi%&#10;\\beta)^{3/4}e^{-\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{2}v(0)\\beta},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>m</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><msqrt><mi>\u03c3</mi></msqrt></mfrac><mo>\u2243</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><msqrt><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>\u03c3</mi></msub></msqrt></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mfrac><msup><mi>\u03c0</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
