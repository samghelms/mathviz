This correspondence relations a weakly coupling gravity in $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time to a strongly coupling conformal field theory (CFT) in $d$-dimensional spacetime. As the correspondence maps a strongly coupling many-body problem into a weakly coupling gravity system in one more dimension, it opens a new approach to deal with the strongly correlated electron systems which are difficult to handle in traditional condensed matter theories. Over the past years, this correspondence has been applied into an abundant of strongly correlated condensed systems such as  superconductor/superfuild~\\cite{Hartnoll:2008vx,Hartnoll:2008kx,Hartnoll:2009sz,Herzog:2009xv,McGreevy:2009xe,Horowitz:2010gk,Cai:2015cya}, fermi/non-fermi liquids~\\cite{Lee:2008xf,Liu:2009dm,Cubrovic:2009ye}, charge density wave and metal/insulator phase transition~\\cite{Aperis:2010cd,Donos:2013gda,Ling:2014saa} and some systems far from thermal equilibrium~\\cite{Murata:2010dx,Bhaseen:2012gg,Adams:2012pj,Garcia-Garcia:2013rha,Chesler:2013lia}.  In these works, the attentions are focused on the electric transport properties in strongly correlated materials such as conductivity. Though there are a few of works involving magnetism in  holographic superconductor models, magnetism does not pay the central role. However, some important strongly correlated phenomena  including high temperature superconductors and heavy fermion metals are controlled by magnetism of the material. Because of the strong correlation between electrons in the materials, there is still lack of a well theoretical description.  The gauge/gravity duality provides  an approach and perspective to understand these challenging problems.\n\nAs the spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking, which  plays am important role in building holographic superconductor models, the time reversal symmetry breaking is the characteristic of magnetic ordered states. An  important property in magnetic materials is the response to external magnetic field. In  phenomenology, a holographic model which can describe the phenomena involving spontaneous magnetic ordered state should give time reversal symmetry breaking spontaneously and characteristic response to external magnetic field. In this paper, we will introduce  our recent works about using holographic duality to understand strong coupling phenomena controlled by magnetism. We will first give  a holographic model to realize the ferromagnetic phase transition and discuss its important properties. Then we will show some singificant results in understanding some novel magnetic materials based on this model, including the coexistence and competition between ferromagnetism and superconductivity, colossal magnetic resistance and antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition induced by an external magnetic field.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Holographic ferromagnetic model}\n\nThe model we are considering is Einstein-Maxwell theory in asymptotic AdS space-time. The first holographic ferromagnetic model was proposed in Ref.~\\cite{Cai:2014oca}. However, this mode exists external degree of freedoms which leads ghost or causality violation. Here we will introduce a modified model proposed in Ref.~\\cite{Cai:2015bsa}. The action in the bulk  is,\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{action1}\nS&=&\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2}\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}(L_{1}+\\lambda^2 L_{2}),\\nonumber\\\\\nL_{1}&=&\\mathcal{R}+\\frac{6}{L^2}-F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu},\\\\\nL_{2}&=&-\\frac{1}{12}(d M)^2-\\frac{m^2}{4}M_{\\mu\\nu}M^{\\mu\\nu}-M^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{J}{8}V(M).\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $L$ is the AdS radius and $2\\kappa^2=16\\pi G$ is associated with the gravitational constant in the bulk. We will set them both to be unity in the following. $g$ is the determinant of the bulk metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. $A_{\\mu}$ is U(1) gauge potential and $F_{\\mu\\nu}=(dA)_{\\mu\\nu}$.  $d M$ is the exterior differential of 2-form field $M_{\\mu\\nu}$. $m^2, \\lambda$ and $J$ are three real model parameters with $J<0$ and $m^2>0$ in order the magnetization to happen spontaneously. $V(M_{\\mu\\nu})$ is a nonlinear potential of the 2-form field to describe the self-interaction of the polarization tensor. It should be expanded as the even power of $M_{\\mu\\nu}$. The choice of nonlinear potential is not unique. Following Ref.~\\cite{Cai:2015bsa}, we take the following form,\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{expV}\nV(M_{\\mu\\nu})&=&(^{*}M_{\\mu\\nu}M^{\\mu\\nu})^2=[^{*}(M\\wedge M)]^2.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nHere $^{*}$ is the Hodge-star operator.\n\nIn the simple case, the dual boundary is isotropy and homogenous, so all the fields in the bulk are only  functions of radius $r$. Specially, we will use following ansatz for metric and matter field,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{5}\nds^2&=&-r^2 f(r) e^{a(r)}dt^2+\\frac{dr^2}{r^2 f(r)}+r^2(dx^2+dy^2),\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{6}\nM_{\\mu\\nu}=-p(r)dt\\wedge dr+\\rho(r)dx\\wedge dy,~~A_{\\mu}&=&\\phi(r)dt+Bx dy,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith some real functions $f(r)$, $a(r)$, $\\phi(r)$, $p(r)$,and $\\rho(r)$, which are determined by equations of motions through the variation of action~\\eqref{action1}.\n\nThe bulk field $B$ is a constant magnetic field, which can be regarded as external magnetic field in the dual boundary theory. We will denote the position of the horizon as $r_{h}$ and the conformal boundary will be at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$. In order to study a dual theory with finite chemical potential or charge density accompanied by a U(1) symmetry, we need turn on $A_{t}=\\phi(r)$ in the bulk. The magnetic moment density in the dual boundary is expressed as,\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{defN1}\nN=-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}\\int_{r_h}^\\infty\\frac{\\rho e^{a/2}}{r^2}dr.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N=-\\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{2}\\int_{r_{h}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\rho e^{a/2}}{r^{2}}dr.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mfrac><msup><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>h</mi></msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></msubsup><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02936.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nHere $a_0, a_1>0, N_1$ and  $\\tilde{J}_f<0$ are all constants, the details of these constants can be found in Ref.~\\cite{Cai:2015jta}.

In the nonzero magnetic field case, the expression \\eqref{expand4} gives out correct magnetic susceptibility behavior and hysteresis loop. When the temperature is far way from its critical value, then the expression \\eqref{expand4} is not appliable. The spontaneous magnetic moment density and magnetic susceptibility can be determined numerically from the equations of motion. One typical result is shown in  Fig.~\\ref{F1}. One can find that the model realizes the hysteresis loop of single magnetic domain and that the magnetic susceptibility satisfies the Curie-Weiss law.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{TM5.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{TM4.pdf}\n\\vspace*{8pt}\n\\caption{The magnetic moment $N$ (left panel) as a function of temperature in different magnetic field $B$ and the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ (right panel) as a function of temperature.

This can be understood from Fig.~\\ref{F2}  schematically. As the high temperature corresponds to strong surface gravity and the gravity dominates the system, the condensation of the  2-form field caused by vacuum fluctuation will be attracted into the black hole and disappear. This implies that the thermal fluctuation\ndominates the materials in high temperature and the ordered magnetic moment will become disordered quickly because of thermal fluctuation. In low temperature, the surface gravity becomes weak and the repulsion dominate the system.  The condensation of the 2-form field caused by vacuum fluctuation can be held near the horizon. This implies that the thermal fluctuation is weak and cannot destroy the the ordered magnetic moment so  that the macroscopical magnetic moment appears.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.38\\textwidth]{TMH1.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{TMH2.pdf}\n\\vspace*{8pt}\n\\caption{The schematic diagram for the condensation of the 2-form field near the black hole horizon.

As this framework is independent of the model such as holographic superconductor or fermi/non-fermi liquid, we can combine it with them and study spontaneous magnetic order in unconventional superconductors, strange metals or other novel materials.\n\n\\subsection{Competition and coexistence of  ferromagnetism and superconductivity}\nOne of interesting problems is the coexistence of  ferromagnetism and superconductivity in heavy fermi materials such as UGe$_2$\\cite{Lonzarich},\nURhGe\\cite{Aoki} and UCoGe\\cite{Huy}. In a very long time, it was thought these two phenomenons are incompatible with each other. In the viewpoint of BCS theory, any magnetic impurity will suppresses the singlet Cooper pair formation, which causes a rapid depression of the superconducting transition temperature. Likewise, the superconductivity can screen off the magnetic field and leads to  that the long-range magnetic order is accompanied by the expulsion of superconductivity. However, the new novel materials challenge this belief. In some  heavy fermi materials, the ferromagnetism and superconductivity are found to coexist with each other. The nature of this superconducting state in ferromagnetic materials is currently under debate. The heavy effective mass of  valence electrons shows the strong correlation between them, which implies that approximations and conception of free field lose their validness.\n\nIn Ref. \\cite{Cai:2014dza}, the authors first study the competition and coexistence of  ferromagnetism and superconductivity from holographic duality. By  combining  a holographic $p$-wave superconductor model\\cite{Cai:2013aca} and a holographic  ferromagnetism model, Ref. \\cite{Cai:2014dza} studied the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity. It is found that the results depend on the self-interaction of magnetic moment of the complex vector field and which phase appears first. In the case that the ferromagnetic phase appears first, if the interaction is attractive, the system  shows the ferromagnetism and superconductivity can coexist in low temperatures.  If the interaction is repulsive,  the system will only be in a pure ferromagnetic state.  In the case that the superconducting phase appears first, the attractive interaction will lead to a magnetic $p$-wave superconducting phase in low temperatures. If the interaction is repulsive, the system will transform into a pure ferromagnetic phase when the temperature is lowered.\n\n\\subsection{Colossal magnetic resistance in holographic duality}\nAnother interesting application is about the phenomena called ``colossal magnetoresistance\" (CMR) effect, which appaers in the manganites such as A$_{1-x}$B$_x$MnO$_3$ (A= La, Pr, Sm, etc. and B = Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb). Such phenomena is among the main areas of research in strongly correlated electron systems~\\cite{Urushibara,Uehara,MBS,Dagottoa,Nagaev,Cengiz,Mukherjee}. In these materials, there is remarkable magnetoresistivity near the Curie temperature $T_C$ and an insulator (or semiconductor)/metal phase transition associated with a paramagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition happens. The CMR effect has a completely different physical origin from the ``giant\" magnetoresistance observed in layered and clustered compounds. Because of the progress in computation and mean field studies for realistic models, many important results have been achieved. However, a completely understanding of the CMR effect is still a challenge.\n\nWithin massive gravity, Ref. \\cite{Cai:2015wfa} constructs a gravity dual for insulator/metal phase transition and CMR effect. The main results in Ref. \\cite{Cai:2015wfa} can be shown in  Fig.~\\ref{F3}. From the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{F3}, we see that the DC resistance shows an insulator behavior when the temperature is higher than $T_C$, while the temperature is less than the Curie temperature $T_C$, the resistivity decreases, which shows a metal's behavior. There is a distinct peak at the temperature where spontaneous magnetization begins to appear and an insulator/metal phase transition happens there.  This is just one of characteristic properties of CMR materials in manganese oxides.  What's more, when a small magnetic field $B$ is turned on, we find that the resistivity is very sensitive to the external magnetic field.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.37\\textwidth]{CMR1c2.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.38\\textwidth]{TOmega3c.pdf}\n\\vspace*{8pt}\n\\caption{Left panel: the DC resistivity of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$ as a function of temperature for different magnetic field~\\cite{Urushibara}.

In  the antiferromagnetic model, in order to describe the magnetic structures of antiferromagnetism, Ref. \\cite{Cai:2014jta} introduces two different antisymmetry polarization fields in the bulk. These polarizations couple to U(1) gauge field strength and each other. The system shows a critical temperature $T_N$ if the values of parameters are in some suitable region.  In the case of absence of external magnetic field and low temperature, the magnetic moments of these tensor condense in antiparallel manner with the same magnitude, which leads to an antiferromagnetic state. In the weak external magnetic field, the magnetic susceptibility density has a peak at critical temperature and satisfies the Curie-Weiss law in the paramagnetic phase of antiferromagnetic materials.\n\nOne unexpected discovery is that the model in Ref.\\cite{Cai:2014jta} shows critical temperature $T_N$ will be suppressed by external magnetic field. There is a critical magnetic field $B_c$ where the critical temperature will be suppressed into zero. This shows that this holographic antiferromagnetic model can describe a quantum phase transition (QPT) induced by magnetic field. Inspired by this result, Refs. \\cite{Cai:2015mja,Cai:2015xpa} investigate a holographic model for antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition induced by magnetic field.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth]{TNB3.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.34\\textwidth]{gap1.pdf}\n\\vspace*{8pt}\n\\caption{Left panel: the antiferromagnetic critical temperature $T_N$ versus the external magnetic field $B$. The solid curve is holographic results and the different dots are experimental data\\cite{Cai:2015mja,Niven} for pyrochlore compounds,  Er$_{2-2x}$Y$_{2x}$Ti$_2$O$_7$ with three different doping $x$.   $T_N$ is the antiferromagnetic critical temperature and $T_{N0}$ is the value of $T_N$ at $B=0$.

We can see that, after rescaling the  temperature and magnetic field, the antiferromagnetic transition boundary of (Er$_{1-x}$Y$_x$)$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is  insensitive to the doping, which shows a universal behavior. The holographic model can cover well the experimental date. Besides, the holographic model forecasts two scaling relations,\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&\\widetilde{\\Delta}=C(B/B_c-1), \\text{with}~\\widetilde{\\Delta}=\\Delta/k_BT_{N0},\\label{TB1a}\\\\\n&\\widetilde{T}_N/\\ln \\widetilde{T}_N\\propto(1-B/B_c),\\label{TB1b}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $\\widetilde{T}_N=T_N/T_{N0}$, $k_B$ is Boltzmann constant and $C$ is a constant. These scaling relations can be analytically presented by considering the emergent geometry AdS$_2$  in the  IR limit~\\cite{Cai:2015xpa}. The first one has been measured in (Er$_{1-x}$Y$_x$)$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ (see the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{F4}) and experimental data give constant $C\\approx5.0$, which is very closed to the holographic result $C\\approx4.2$. Because of the difficulty in experiments, it is still an open question for experimenter to check the other scaling relationship in Eq.\\eqref{TB1b}.\n\n\\section{Summary}\nUnderstanding magnetic properties of  materials has a very long history. However, it is still mysterious for lots of materials in extreme pressure and low temperature. Magnetism plays a crucial role in Mott transition, heavy fermion, and quantum phase transition. In fact, quantum magnetism is one of\nthe manifestations of strong electron-electron interaction, so its treatment should be part of general strongly correlated electron effects. Holographic duality is a very suitable tool for such phenomena. This paper gave a brief review about the applications of holographic duality in understanding unusual magnetic materials. Some quantitative comparison between holographic results and experimental data was made and some predictions from holographic duality models were discussed. Though some works have been done to understand the phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems controlled by magnetism, it is still far from a complete understanding. The most works at present stage are to  recover some properties which have been discovered in experiments. Of course, this is important and provides a starting point to build a holographic description for real materials.\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China  with grants No.11375247 and No.11435006.

In the nonzero magnetic field case, the expression \\eqref{expand4} gives out correct magnetic susceptibility behavior and hysteresis loop. When the temperature is far way from its critical value, then the expression \\eqref{expand4} is not appliable. The spontaneous magnetic moment density and magnetic susceptibility can be determined numerically from the equations of motion. One typical result is shown in  Fig.~\\ref{F1}. One can find that the model realizes the hysteresis loop of single magnetic domain and that the magnetic susceptibility satisfies the Curie-Weiss law.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{TM5.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{TM4.pdf}\n\\vspace*{8pt}\n\\caption{The magnetic moment $N$ (left panel) as a function of temperature in different magnetic field $B$ and the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ (right panel) as a function of temperature.

This can be understood from Fig.~\\ref{F2}  schematically. As the high temperature corresponds to strong surface gravity and the gravity dominates the system, the condensation of the  2-form field caused by vacuum fluctuation will be attracted into the black hole and disappear. This implies that the thermal fluctuation\ndominates the materials in high temperature and the ordered magnetic moment will become disordered quickly because of thermal fluctuation. In low temperature, the surface gravity becomes weak and the repulsion dominate the system.  The condensation of the 2-form field caused by vacuum fluctuation can be held near the horizon. This implies that the thermal fluctuation is weak and cannot destroy the the ordered magnetic moment so  that the macroscopical magnetic moment appears.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.38\\textwidth]{TMH1.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{TMH2.pdf}\n\\vspace*{8pt}\n\\caption{The schematic diagram for the condensation of the 2-form field near the black hole horizon.

As this framework is independent of the model such as holographic superconductor or fermi/non-fermi liquid, we can combine it with them and study spontaneous magnetic order in unconventional superconductors, strange metals or other novel materials.\n\n\\subsection{Competition and coexistence of  ferromagnetism and superconductivity}\nOne of interesting problems is the coexistence of  ferromagnetism and superconductivity in heavy fermi materials such as UGe$_2$\\cite{Lonzarich},\nURhGe\\cite{Aoki} and UCoGe\\cite{Huy}. In a very long time, it was thought these two phenomenons are incompatible with each other. In the viewpoint of BCS theory, any magnetic impurity will suppresses the singlet Cooper pair formation, which causes a rapid depression of the superconducting transition temperature. Likewise, the superconductivity can screen off the magnetic field and leads to  that the long-range magnetic order is accompanied by the expulsion of superconductivity. However, the new novel materials challenge this belief. In some  heavy fermi materials, the ferromagnetism and superconductivity are found to coexist with each other. The nature of this superconducting state in ferromagnetic materials is currently under debate. The heavy effective mass of  valence electrons shows the strong correlation between them, which implies that approximations and conception of free field lose their validness.\n\nIn Ref. \\cite{Cai:2014dza}, the authors first study the competition and coexistence of  ferromagnetism and superconductivity from holographic duality. By  combining  a holographic $p$-wave superconductor model\\cite{Cai:2013aca} and a holographic  ferromagnetism model, Ref. \\cite{Cai:2014dza} studied the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity. It is found that the results depend on the self-interaction of magnetic moment of the complex vector field and which phase appears first. In the case that the ferromagnetic phase appears first, if the interaction is attractive, the system  shows the ferromagnetism and superconductivity can coexist in low temperatures.  If the interaction is repulsive,  the system will only be in a pure ferromagnetic state.  In the case that the superconducting phase appears first, the attractive interaction will lead to a magnetic $p$-wave superconducting phase in low temperatures. If the interaction is repulsive, the system will transform into a pure ferromagnetic phase when the temperature is lowered.\n\n\\subsection{Colossal magnetic resistance in holographic duality}\nAnother interesting application is about the phenomena called ``colossal magnetoresistance\" (CMR) effect, which appaers in the manganites such as A$_{1-x}$B$_x$MnO$_3$ (A= La, Pr, Sm, etc. and B = Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb). Such phenomena is among the main areas of research in strongly correlated electron systems~\\cite{Urushibara,Uehara,MBS,Dagottoa,Nagaev,Cengiz,Mukherjee}. In these materials, there is remarkable magnetoresistivity near the Curie temperature $T_C$ and an insulator (or semiconductor)/metal phase transition associated with a paramagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition happens. The CMR effect has a completely different physical origin from the ``giant\" magnetoresistance observed in layered and clustered compounds. Because of the progress in computation and mean field studies for realistic models, many important results have been achieved. However, a completely understanding of the CMR effect is still a challenge.\n\nWithin massive gravity, Ref. \\cite{Cai:2015wfa} constructs a gravity dual for insulator/metal phase transition and CMR effect. The main results in Ref. \\cite{Cai:2015wfa} can be shown in  Fig.~\\ref{F3}. From the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{F3}, we see that the DC resistance shows an insulator behavior when the temperature is higher than $T_C$, while the temperature is less than the Curie temperature $T_C$, the resistivity decreases, which shows a metal's behavior. There is a distinct peak at the temperature where spontaneous magnetization begins to appear and an insulator/metal phase transition happens there.  This is just one of characteristic properties of CMR materials in manganese oxides.  What's more, when a small magnetic field $B$ is turned on, we find that the resistivity is very sensitive to the external magnetic field.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.37\\textwidth]{CMR1c2.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.38\\textwidth]{TOmega3c.pdf}\n\\vspace*{8pt}\n\\caption{Left panel: the DC resistivity of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$ as a function of temperature for different magnetic field~\\cite{Urushibara}.
