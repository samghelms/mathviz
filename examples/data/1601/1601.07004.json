This subject has received considerable\nattention recently \\cite{Jaya}--\\cite{Tanaka}. Most of the\nexperiments on growth kinetics have been performed near the critical\npoint of binary liquid mixtures (or simple fluids) because there the\ncritical slowing down allows the phenomenon to be observed during a\nreasonable time.  After a thermal quench from the one-phase region\nto the two-phase region of the phase diagram (Fig.  \\ref{PhDiag}) the\ndomains of the new phases nucleate and grow.  It turns out that two\nalternative regimes of coarsening are possible.  The first can be\nobserved when the volume fraction $\\phi$ of the minority phase is\nlower than some threshold \\cite{Knob} and the domains of the\ncharacteristic size $R$ grow according to the law $R\\propto t^{1/3}$\n($t$ is the time elapsed after the quench) as spherical drops.  The\nsecond regime manifests itself when the quench is performed at high\nvolume fraction, the coarsening law is $R\\propto t^1$ and the domains\ngrow as a complicated interconnected structure.  Recent experiments\n\\cite{Perrot} show that when $0.1<\\phi<0.3$ the $t^{1/3}$ growth can\nbe explained by a mechanism of Brownian drop motion and coalescence\nrather than the Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism \\cite{Lifsh} which holds\nfor $\\phi\\rightarrow 0$ and which we will not discuss here. We are\ninterested in the late stages of growth when phase boundaries are\nalready well developed and the concentrations of the phases are very\nclose to the equilibrium values at given temperature $T$ as defined\nby the coexistence curve (Fig.~\\ref{PhDiag}).  Then the drops grow\njust because the system tends to minimize the total surface\nseparating the phases (i.e. due to coalescence) and $\\phi$ no longer\ndepends on time.\n\n{\\bf Brownian coalescence.} The Brownian mechanism was considered\nfirst by Smoluchowski \\cite{Smo} for coagulation of colloids and was\nthen applied to phase separation by Binder and Stauffer \\cite{Binder}\nand Siggia \\cite{Sig}.

By means of a dimensional analysis\nSiggia \\cite{Sig} has shown that hydrodynamics is needed to explain\nthe kinetics. It assumed the growth to be ruled by the Taylor\ninstability of the long tube of fluid, which breaks into separate\ndrops and associated the growth rate with the rate of the evolution\nof the unstable fluctuations. This idea has been developed by San\nMiguel {\\it et al.} in \\cite{SanMig}.  However, it was not clear how\nthis process was related to the growth.\n\nAnother approach has been considered by Kawasaki and Ohta \\cite{Kaw}\nwho used a model of coupled equations of hydrodynamics and diffusion.\nIt was assumed that the growth is controlled by diffusion and the\nhydrodynamic correction to this process was calculated. However, the\ntranslational movement of the drops due to the pressure gradient\nwas not taken into account.  The motion of the liquid was supposed to\nbe induced by the concentration gradient only.  At the same time, it\nis well known that the concentration variation does not enter the\nequations of hydrodynamics of the liquid mixture in a first\napproximation \\cite{Land}. Moreover, it is evident that at high\nvolume fraction the coalescence process induced by the translational\nmotion of the drops becomes very important.\n\nRecently, several groups \\cite{puri,alex,valls,shino,appert} performed large\nscale direct numerical simulations by using different approaches to\nsolve coupled equations of diffusion and hydrodynamics. Some\nrecovered the linear growth law  \\cite{alex,shino}, whilst the\nothers were not able to reach the late stages of separation and\nmeasured the transient values of the growth exponent (between 1/3 and\n1). In spite of these efforts, the physical mechanism for the linear\ngrowth has not been clarified. To our knowledge, the simulations\nnever showed two asymptotical laws depending on the volume fraction:\nthe exponent is either larger than 1/3 when accounting for\nhydrodynamics or 1/3 for pure diffusion. Thus the precise threshold\nin $\\phi$ separating the $t^1$ and $t^{1/3}$ regimes is not predicted\neither by any theory or by simulation.\n\n\\begin{figure}\\centering\\includegraphics[width=5cm]{Figsurf}\n\\caption{The positions of the drop surfaces at the beginning (dotted line) and at the end (solid line) of the\nsimulation. $\\psi$ is the coalescence distance, $d_0$ is the initial distance between the drops, $X'$--$X$ is\nthe axis of cylindrical symmetry. \\label{Surf}} \\end{figure}\n\n{\\bf Simulation of coalescence.} We show here that a $t^1$ growth can\noriginate from a coalescence mechanism whose limiting process between\ntwo coalescences is not Brownian diffusion but rather flows induced\nby previous coalescence.  We use the concept of ``coalescence-induced\ncoalescence'' as introduced by Tanaka \\cite{Tanaka} who, however,\nthought that induction by the hydrodynamic flow was not relevant,\nhaving stated that coalescence takes place after the decay of the\nflow. We consider here a coalescence process between two drops and\nstudy numerically the generated flow and its influence on the third\nneighboring drop. The fully deterministic hydrodynamic problem within the\n creeping flow approximation (which is well justified near the critical point\n\\cite{Sig}) was solved. The free boundary conditions were applied on\nall drop interfaces whose motion  is driven by surface\ntension. At each time step the velocity of each mesh point on the interface\ncontours\n was computed using a boundary integral approach\n\\cite{Pozdr}. When the new positions of the interfaces have been calculated, the procedure was continued\niteratively.\n The details of the solution will be\npresented elsewhere \\cite{Prep}.  We begin the simulation when coalescence starts between two drops of size $R$\n(Fig.~\\ref{Surf}), i.e.  when the drops of the minority phase approach to within a distance of coalescence\n$\\psi$ which corresponds to the interface thickness of the drop \\cite{Sig}.  We choose for the simulation\n$R=10\\psi$. Then we place another drop at the distance $d_0$ from the composite drop (defined as the aggregate\nof two coalescing drops) and envelope these two drops by a spherical shell to mimic the surrounding pattern of\ntightly packed drops. Thus the distance between the drops and the shell has been chosen to be $d_0$ also. The\nsurface tension $\\sigma$ is supposed to be the same for all the interfaces.  Unfortunately, due to the\nprohibitively long computing times, we could not simulate the process of coalescence of two {\\em spherical}\ndrops. Instead, we had to use a configuration with cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis $X'$ -- $X$\n(see Fig.~\\ref{Surf}) which is expected to retain the main features associated with the spherical shape. In the\nbeginning of the simulation the composite drop looks more like a torus. The spherical shell approximation can be\njustified by the fact that the main effect of the assembly of surrounding drops (as well as of the spherical\nshell) is to confine the motion of the neighboring drops -- see \\cite{Prep} for an advanced discussion. A setup\nwith only two drops without either a shell or surrounding drops would not enable a new coalescence even for the\nsmallest interdrop distances.  Though we cannot control quantitatively this approximation, it is the simplest\none which captures the main features of the process.\n\nA first important result from the simulation is that the flow\ngenerated by the first coalescence is able to generate {\\em a second\ncoalescence} between the composite drop and the neighboring drop\n(Fig.~\\ref{Surf}). This means that the lubrication interaction with\nthe surrounding drops (with the shell in our model) make attract the\ncomposite and the neighboring drops (note that the second coalescence\n{\\em does not} take place between this neighboring drop and the\nshell).  This  leads to the formation of a new elongated\ndroplet. When the drops are close enough to each other the composite\ndrop will have no time to relax to a spherical shape since a new\ncoalescence takes place before relaxation. An interconnected pattern\nnaturally follows.  In contrast, when the drops are far from each\nother ($d_0/R\\gg 1$), the second coalescence will never take place.\nThe droplets take a spherical shape and the liquid motion stops. It\nis also clear that if $d_0/R < l_G$, which we call ``geometric\ncoalescence limit'', coalescence necessary occurs due to geometrical\nconstraint. We find $l_G\\approx 0.484$ \\cite{Prep}, \\cite{l_G}.\n\nThe second important result is that the coalescence takes place also\nfor $l_G<d_0/R<l_H$ where $l_H$ is a value which we call\n``hydrodynamic coalescence limit''. It is defined as a reduced\ninitial distance where the time between two coalescences ($t_c$)\nbecomes infinite .

The\nhydrodynamic interaction between them is always repulsive due to the\nlubrication force. Thus they tend to be as far from each other as\npossible.

Such a correlation explains why the drops do not\npercolate \\cite{Jaya} when the volume fraction $\\phi$ reaches the\n{\\it random} percolation limit $(\\phi\\approx 0.15)$.\n\nSince no quantitative information is available to determine $b$, we\ncalculate its upper and lower bounds.

This is the face centered cubic lattice\nwhere $b=\\pi/3\\sqrt{2}\\approx 0.74$ and which corresponds to the\nfully ordered structure.
