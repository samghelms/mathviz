[{"file": "1601.00757.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis feature was also modeled by \\cite{ber09}, and is likely produced by resonant proton scattering. \nIf resonant proton scattering is the origin of this spectral feature, then it provides a measurement of the magnetic field in which the scattering occurs.\nThe energy of such an absorption line is: $E_{\\rm{cyc}} = 0.63(1+z)^{-1}(B/10^{14}G)$ keV where $(1+z)^{-1}= (1-2GM/Rc^{2})^{1/2}$ is the gravitational redshift.\nFrom 2006 September 24 to 2014 March 4, we did not find significant changes in the absorption line among the different epochs.\nWe therefore held the parameters of this absorption line fixed in all of the later observations, from 2006 September 24 to 2014 March 4.\nWe also did not find significant changes in the absorption line among the different epochs from 2003 September 8 to  2006 March 12.    \nSince the line energy centroid did not differ with any statistical significance between earlier and later observations, we adopted a constant value of 1.2 keV across all epochs.\nIn summary, the line energy was held fixed at 1.2 keV at all epochs, but the line strength and width were allowed to differ between the two and three blackbody regimes. \nThe line width $\\sigma$ was about 320 eV in the three blackbody regime, and about 130 eV in the two blackbody regime.\nThe strength of the line $d$ decreased from 0.28 in earlier observations to 0.07 in later observations.\nWe also searched for evidence of phase-variability of the absorption feature by fitting the peaks and troughs of the pulse profiles separately.  \nWe did not find any statistically significant differences in the best fit Gaussian absorption feature parameters.\nWe also note that Bernardini et al. did not find it necessary to include an absorption line in the first three observations on 2003 September 8, 2003 October 12, and 2004 March 11.\nHowever, with our higher adopted column density value, we found that an absorption feature was necessary in these observations as well.\nTo illustrate this, we show the line residuals of the 2003 September 8 observation in Figure \\ref{fig:line_res}, where all the model parameters are held at the best fit values of Table 2, but the line strength is set to zero.\nSimilarly, in Figures \\ref{fig:11_resid} and \\ref{fig:22_resid} we show the absorption feature in the 2009 March 5 and 2014 March 4 observations. \n\nTable 2 lists the results of the fits to the three-to-two-blackbody model.  \nFigures \\ref{fig:xraylum}, \\ref{fig:temps} and \\ref{fig:areas} illustrate the evolution of the bolometric luminosity, temperatures and apparent emitting areas.\nBecause the absorption feature at 1.2 keV was characterized by a different strength and width in the two and three blackbody regimes, we set the strength of this component to zero when computing the fluxes.\nThis convention allows for a meaningful comparison of the fluxes as {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ moves from the three blackbody regime to the two blackbody regime. \nThe model parameters in the three blackbody regime and the model parameters in the two blackbody regime are technically components of distinct models.\n For this reason we introduce new symbols $\\textit{kT}_{\\rm{warm-hot}}$, $\\textit{F}_{\\rm{warm-hot}}$, and $\\textit{A}_{\\rm{warm-hot}}$ in Table 2.\nThe three-to-two-blackbody model is an approximation to a gradual transition between these two regimes, and that is why there is a jump in the values of  $kT_{\\rm{warm}}$ to the values of  $kT_{\\rm{warm-hot}}$ when the model is switched.

surface interpretation for consistency with a physically plausible value of the NS radius. \n Figure \\ref{fig:chi-square} shows the chi-square statistic on a grid of values of surface temperature and column density.  \n Since the NS surface temperature parameter is most correlated with the column density, this grid provides a good estimate of the uncertainty in the NS surface temperature, and therefore also the NS radius.  \n Since none of the other model parameters (e.g. the cold component normalization) were varied, this is an underestimate of the full NS radius confidence range.  \n Figure \\ref{fig:radius}  shows the inferred NS radius for all of the grid points at the top of the figure. \n These radii values were calculated as follows:\n At each grid point the free model parameters were re-fit, and the new best fit blackbody normalization was used to calculate an apparent radius assuming a distance of 3.5 kpc.\nA distance of $3.5\\pm0.5$~kpc was measured by \\cite{min08}.\n We then assumed a mass of 1.4 M$_{\\odot}$ and applied the relativistic correction, $R_{\\infty}=R\\,(1-r_{\\rm g}/R)^{-1/2}$, to compute the physical NS radius.\n $R_{\\infty}$ is the apparent NS radius at infinity and $r_g = 2GM/c^2$ is the Schwarzschild radius.  \n We find $R_{\\infty}=28.9^{+6.7}_{-5.3}$ km and $R=26.6^{+6.7}_{-5.5}$ km.\n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth]{f7.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:chi-square}\nChi-square grid for a range of column densities and temperatures of the whole NS surface.

We account for the general relativistic correction between apparent and physical NS radius.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n This is significantly different from the physically plausible range of about $9-13$~km, and we emphasize that we are not claiming that the best fit value $R$ quoted above is a measurement of the NS radius.\n Rather, we interpret this large best fit radius as evidence that the whole surface of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ is visible, and that the spectrum has some deviations from two pure blackbodies plus a Gaussian absorption feature.\n In addition to deviations from simple, uniform temperature blackbodies, we list here several factors that may contribute to this discrepancy between the physical NS radius and the best fit value. \nFirst, the best fit radius $R$ is highly sensitive to the shape and energy of the absorption feature.\nFor example, fixing the line energy at 1.3 keV decreases $R$ by 22\\% while increasing the chi-square statistic to only 1.27.\n Second, the physical NS radius measurement is proportional to the NS distance, and it possible that {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ is at a distance closer to the low end of the range of 3.5 $\\pm$ 0.5 kpc measured by \\cite{min08}.\n Third, the physical NS radius measurement  decreases as the mass of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ increases, and it is possible that {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ is more massive than the canonical value of $1.4\\,M_{\\odot}$. \n NSs with masses up to $2.0\\,M_{\\odot}$ have been observed \\citep{dem10}.\n A magnetar mass has never been measured, and it might not be surprising if magnetars as a class are toward the upper end of the range of possible NS masses \\citep{mer15}. \n Fourth, as stated above, our estimate of the confidence range of this physical NS radius measurement is actually an underestimate of the true statistical uncertainty.\n \nWe also checked the 2008 March 18 Chandra observation for consistency with the two blackbody model.  \nThis observation is notable because it was taken just months before \\ {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ became radio quiet in late 2008 \\citep{cam15}.  \nWe held the hydrogen column density, absorption line, and cool temperature component fixed at the {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ fit values and allowed the warm temperature component to vary.    \nWe find that it is consistent with the rest of the later observations with a reduced chi-square fit statistic of 1.05 for 112 degrees of freedom, and a warm component temperature of 0.35 keV.\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{l c c c c c c c c c c} \n\\tabletypesize{\\tiny}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.009in}

the first seven observations, as originally considered by \\cite{got07}. \n In this model the two temperatures are thought of as a central hot spot on the surface of the NS, surrounded by a warm temperature annulus.  \nWe also include a Gaussian absorption line at 1.2 keV.   \nWe again found this model to be a good fit to the first seven observations, although with lower values of the hydrogen column density than in the three-to-two-blackbody model.  \nAll of these results are consistent with the findings of \\cite{got07}.  \nWe found a reduced chi-square of 1.15 for 775 degrees of freedom.  \nIn light of the most recent data indicating a larger column density than previously measured, we also attempted to fit a two blackbody model with a column density fixed at this new larger value to the earlier observations.  \nThis resulted in a slightly worse fit with a reduced chi-square of 1.24 for 776 degrees of freedom.  \nTable 3 lists the results of the fits to the two blackbody model. \n\nWe then tried to fit the this same two blackbody model, (i.e. with the  column density value fixed at $N_{\\rm H}= 0.76 \\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) to the latest observations and found it was a poor fit to the data with a reduced chi-square value of 1.5.  \nThe lower value of the column density resulted in larger temperatures for the cool blackbody component, averaging around 0.16 keV.\nThis poor fit leads us to favor the larger $N_{\\rm H}$ value and the three-to-two-blackbody model.\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{l c c c c c c c}\n\\tabletypesize{\\tiny}\n\\tablecaption{Two

(2009) found that both one and two blackbody models are good fits to the \\textit{ROSAT} data.  \nGotthelf et al. (2004) fit a single blackbody model to four archival \\textit{ROSAT} observations, spanning 1990 September 3 to 1993 April 3, and calculated unabsorbed X-ray fluxes \nranging from $(5.5-8.3) \\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (in the $0.5-10$ keV range). \nFrom 2009 March 5 to 2014 March 4 we measure unabsorbed X-ray fluxes ranging from $(7.4-7.8) \\times 10^{-13}$  erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the $0.5-10$ keV range, in accord with the \\textit{ROSAT} measurements. \n\nThis evidence suggests that it is possible that {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ is back in its pre-outburst, ``quiescent'' state.\nHowever, given the uncertainty of the details of its pre-outburst state, it is just as possible that {XTE J1810$-$197}'s magnetosphere is in a new configuration.\nThe hot spot on its surface and the 1.2 keV absorption line may even be new features.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison with Other Transient Magnetars}\n\nSeveral other transient magnetars have been found since the discovery of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ in 2003.\nHere we review what is known about the later stages of these other transient magnetars.\nFirst we note that there is no other transient magnetar whose whole surface temperature has been measured.\nThis is likely due to a combination of relatively large distances to and low surface temperatures of the other transient magnetars.\nWe also note that none of the blackbody components of the transient magnetars have been observed to completely fade away after an outburst.\n(A caveat is that 3XMM J185246.6+003317 was only observed for several months after its 2008 outburst, and its current state is therefore unknown.)\n\nTable 4 lists some of the properties of the known transient magnetars as well as the candidate transient magnetars PSR J1622$-$4950 and AX J1845$-$0258.\nWe list the most recently measured spin parameters as well as the most recently measured X-ray luminosity.\nIn the interest of comparing their current spin-down luminosities $\\dot E$ to current bolometric X-ray luminosities, we quote the X-ray luminosities in the widest bands reported.\n\nIn addition to {XTE J1810$-$197}, there are several other transient magnetars whose X-ray luminosity is likely magnetically powered several years post outburst.\nThey are the \"low magnetic field\" magnetar SGR 0418+5729, SGR 0501+4516, CXO 164710.2$-$455216, the Galactic center magnetar SGR J1745$-$2900, and Swift J1822.3$-$1606.\nThe Galactic center magnetar SGR J1745$-$2900 is particularly similar to {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ in that it produced radio emission and had a relatively slow decay as its blackbody temperature and hot spot area decreased.\n\nThere are also three transient magnetars whose spin-down power exceeds their X-ray luminosity.\nThey are 1E 1547.0$-$5408, SGR 1627$-$41, and Swift J1834.9$-$0846.\n1E 1547.0$-$5408 is still much more luminous than its lowest pre-outburst state, and is therefore not in a true quiescent state \\citep{ber09}.\nSGR 1627$-$41 and Swift J1834.9$-$0846 are currently close to their pre-outburst fluxes (an upper bound in the case of Swift J1834.9$-$0846) and could be in true quiescent states \\citep{an12,kar12,esp13}.\n\nIn some cases, there are observations of transient magnetars before their outburst.\nAs alluded to above, a pre-outburst observation of Swift J1834.9$-$0846 with Chandra could not even detect the source, and gave an upper limit on the $2-10$~keV luminosity of $1.7 \\times 10^{31}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ \\citep{kar12}.\nThis could be a pre-outburst quiescent state in which there is no magnetar activity.\nSGR 1627$-$41 was observed between its 1998 and 2008 outbursts, and its luminosity is similar several years after each outburst \\citep{an12}.\nA non-detection of 3XMM J185246.6+003317 by Chandra in 2001 gives an upper bound of $4 \\times 10^{32}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ \\citep{zho14}.\nSGR 0501+4516 was observed by ROSAT before its 2008 outburst and, like {XTE J1810$-$197}, had a similar temperature and flux level post-outburst \\citep{cam14}.\nSGR 1833$-$0832 could not be detected by {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ in 2006, five years before its 2011 outburst \\citep{esp11} \n\nWhile many transient magnetars were fit to blackbody plus powerlaw models, some could be fit to pure blackbody models with temperatures comparable to {XTE J1810$-$197}.\nThe low magnetic field magnetar SGR 0418+5729 has a very small hot spot of temperature 0.3 keV \\citep{rea13}.\nPSR J1622$-$4950 has a hot spot temperature of about 0.5 keV \\citep{and12}.\nSGR 1833$-$0832 is best modeled by a 1.2 keV blackbody \\citep{esp11}.\nThe distance to SGR 1833$-$0832 is highly uncertain, so we don't know if its X-ray luminosity or spin-down power is dominant.\nThe blackbody components of transient magnetars that were modeled by a blackbody plus a power-law are all within about a factor of 2 of these temperature values.\n\nAX J1845$-$0258 is included in this table even though its status as a transient magnetar is uncertain.\nIt has disappeared since its 1993 outburst and its period derivative has not been measured \\citep{tor98,tam06}.\nThe other candidate transient magnetar, PSR J1622$-$4950, was discovered in radio and subsequently observed as an X-ray source.\nIts fading X-ray emission suggests that this radio magnetar could have been observed just after an outburst in 2007 \\citep{and12}.\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{l l l c c l c c}\n\\tabletypesize{\\tiny}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.04in} \n\\tablecaption{Transient Magnetars}\n\\tablehead{

J1810$-$197} \\ would fade away.  \nIn the special case of a narrow j-bundle with a uniform twist, Beloborodov predicts that the hot spot luminosity will decay with a timescale\n $t_{ev}\\approx15\\,V_{9}^{-1}\\,B_{14}\\,R_{6}^{2}\\,\\Psi\\,u_{*}$ years  where $V_{9}$ is the voltage in units of 10$^{9}$~V, $B_{14}$ is the magnetic field in units of 10$^{14}$~G, \n$R_6$ is the NS radius in units of 10$^{6}$~cm, $\\Psi$ is the magnitude of the twist in units of radians, and $u_{*}$ is the angle subtended by the arc of \ncircumference of the hot spot.\nThe rate of decay is even faster than an exponential, since the time constant decreases as the twist angle $\\Psi$ and the size of the hot spot $u_{*}$ decrease.\nWhile this model is a good fit to the data at the beginning of {XTE J1810$-$197}'s outburst, this is not what has been observed in the spectra and pulse profiles from about 2007 onwards.\nFrom 2009 March 5 through 2014 March 4 {XTE J1810$-$197}\\ has been in a steady state, yet the hot spot on its surface remains.\n\n\n\\cite{rea12} suggested that radio magnetars share the property that $L_{x} / \\dot{E} <  1$, but that not all radio magnetars will necessarily satisfy this condition.\nThe observations of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ presented here do not support this proposition.\nBetween 2007 and 2012 {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ reached a spin-down power of $\\dot{E} = (5.6-6.6) \\times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ \\citep{cam15}, \nwhile the luminosity of the cold component of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ alone is $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{34}$ \\textit{d}$^{2}_{3.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$.\n\n\n\\cite{sza15} explain magnetar radio emission with the partially screened gap model that has been developed to explain the radio emission of normal rotation powered pulsars.\nIn this scenario {XTE J1810$-$197}'s radio emission is also rotation powered, and radio emission is only possible if the polar cap is below the critical temperature for ion emission, and the polar cap luminosity is much less than\nthe spin-down power.\nHowever, the polar cap luminosity of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ increased by more than two orders of magnitude during its outburst, while the spin-down luminosity increased by a factor of 8 \\citep{cam15}.\nThis data places a difficult constraint on how this model could explain the turn-on and turn-off of {XTE J1810$-$197}'s radio emission. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\n{XTE J1810$-$197} \\ was the first discovered transient magnetar and therefore provides the longest record of transient magnetar behavior.\nA hot spot on the NS surface is evident even in the most recent observations.\nThe luminosity of this hot spot exceeds {XTE J1810$-$197}'s spin-down power, and is therefore an indicator of continued magnetar activity.\nThere is currently no detailed theoretical model that explains this persistent magnetar activity.\n\nWith the benefit of over ten years of {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ observations, we can say with some confidence that we have detected emission from the whole surface of {XTE J1810$-$197}.\nUnfortunately, large systematic uncertainties plague a measurement of the NS radius.\nWe nevertheless have a good measurement of the surface temperature of a magnetar.\n \nThe radio emission from {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ during its outburst is similar to the radio emission of a subgroup of the known transient magnetars.\nThere is no detailed theoretical model that explains the turn-on and turn-off of {XTE J1810$-$197}'s radio emission, but the X-ray data presented in this paper may provide an important clue.\nThe flux from the hot-spot on the NS surface reached its lowest level just as the radio emission disappeared.\nThis suggests that this magnetar's radio emission is powered by magnetic field decay.\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\n\nThis investigation is based on observations obtained\nwith {\\it XMM-Newton}, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions\ndirectly funded by ESA Member

They are also characterized by unsteady spin down and variable X-ray emission. \nUnlike ``normal'' rotation powered radio pulsars, magnetars' X-ray luminosity can exceed their spin-down power.\nThis luminosity is thought to be supplied by their decaying magnetic fields. \n\n{XTE J1810$-$197}, the first discovered transient magnetar, was found during its X-ray outburst in 2003 \\citep{ibr04}.\nSubsequently {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ became the first magnetar observed to produce emission at radio frequencies \\citep{hal05,cam06}. \nCurrently, four of the twenty-three confirmed magnetars are known to be transient radio emitters \\citep{ola14}.\nThe X-ray flux of {XTE J1810$-$197} declined over the next four years, and it become radio quiet in late 2008 \\citep{got07,ber09,cam06,cam15}.  \n\nA theoretical model of magnetar outbursts relevant to {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ has been developed by \\cite{bel09}.  \nIn Beloborodov's model, a twisted NS magnetosphere stores energy that is released in the X-ray outburst.  \nAs the magnetosphere untwists, particles impact and heat the NS surface, resulting in observable thermal emission.\nBeloborodov's model predicts an approximately exponential luminosity decay consistent with early observations of {XTE J1810$-$197}.\nModels of magnetar spectra relevant to {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ have been developed by \\cite{guv07}, \\cite{alb10}, and \n\\cite{ber11}.\nGuver et al. calculated the effects of photon propagation through the NS atmosphere and magnetosphere, accounting for both quantum and general relativistic effects.\nGuver et al. fit their model to {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ data and calculated a magnetospheric magnetic field strength close to the dipole spin-down value.\nBernardini et al. calculated the effects of light bending and relativistic beaming on the X-ray spectrum.  \nThey fit this model to multiple epochs of data and calculated the viewing geometry of hotter regions on the surface of {XTE J1810$-$197}.\nAlbano et al. used Monte Carlo simulations of the propagation of photons from the NS surface through the magnetosphere and produced synthetic pulse profiles to fit to observations.\nAlbano et al. found that a limited region of the surface of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ was heated, and that this region's size and temperature were decreasing after its outburst.\n\nIn this paper we report on the long term X-ray evolution of {XTE J1810$-$197}, with all available {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ data including previously unpublished data from 2008 through 2014.\nWe also analyze a {\\it Chandra} \\ observation taken near the time when {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ became radio quiet in late 2008, looking for correlations between its X-ray and radio activity.\nWe explore several spectral models, and attempt to determine if {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ has returned to a ``quiescent'' state.\n\n\\section{Data Reduction and Analysis}\n\nTable 1 summarizes the X-ray observations considered in this paper.  \nWe mostly focus on the {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ observations because of {\\it XMM-Newton}'s broader energy coverage, larger effective area, and more stable effective area.

Reduction}\n\nAll of the XMM-Newton data were reduced and extracted using the Science Analysis Software (SAS) version 13.5.  \nWe only used data from the EPIC pn CCD because of its superior long term stability and throughput at low energies (which was particularly important in the later observations as the blackbody temperatures decreased). \nAll observations were performed in Imaging Large Window mode, with the exception of the 2003 September 8 and 2003 October 12 observations, which were performed in Small Window mode and Full Window mode respectively.\nThe XMM-Newton data were filtered to remove time intervals with high-energy flares, and events with FLAG $ = 0$ and PATTERN $\\le4$ were selected from these good time intervals.  \nCircular source and background regions were created with radii of $45^{''}$, or sometimes as small as $30^{''}$ in order to avoid overlap with the edge of a detector chip.  \nThe spectra were grouped with a minimum of 25 counts per bin, and such that the energy resolution was oversampled by no more than a factor of 3.  \n\nThe {\\it Chandra} \\ observation of 2008 March 18 was reduced and extracted using the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations software (CIAO) version 4.6. \nThe observation was performed with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer spectral component (ACIS-S) in Very Faint Timed Exposure mode, with a custom subarray\nof 100 rows to achieve a frame time of 0.3~s, sufficient to resolve the 5.54~s pulsations.\nWe followed the online CIAO thread\\footnote{http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/pointlike/} ``Extract Spectrum and Response Files for a Point-like Source''.\nCircular source and background regions were created with radii of $8^{''}$.\nThe source spectrum was grouped with the default value of 15 counts per bin.\n\nAll spectral fitting of the {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ and {\\it Chandra} \\ data was performed using XSPEC \\citep{arn96}.\n\n\\subsection{Three-To-Two-Blackbody Model}\n\nFollowing \\cite{ber09}, we found that the first seven {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ observations, from 2003 September 8 to  2006 March 12, are well described by a three blackbody model, \nwhere the lowest temperature component (the ``cold'' region) is interpreted as emission from the whole NS surface.  \nThe temperature and area of this cold component are therefore held constant across all epochs.  \nThe hot temperature component is thought of as a small hot spot on the NS surface, and the warm temperature component is thought of as warm annulus surrounding the hot spot.  \nThis simplified model is a rough approximation to hot spot with a large temperature gradient on the surface of the NS.  \nThis temperature gradient is determined by the details of the heating and the NS surface thermal conductivity. \nThe central region is cooling faster than the cooler outer regions, and there is gradual transition to times when the hot spot and annulus are well described by a single temperature.\nStarting with the eighth XMM observation on 2006 September 24, and through the most recent observation on 2014 March 4, we find that the X-ray spectra are well modeled by a two temperature blackbody model. \nThe coldest temperature component is again interpreted as emission from the whole surface and is therefore held constant across all epochs (including the earlier observations from 2003 September 8 to  2006 March 12).  \n\nThis model, in which the spectra of {XTE J1810$-$197} \\ evolve from being well described by three blackbodies at earlier times to two blackbodies at later times, is what we refer to here as the three-to-two-blackbody model.\nThis is distinct from the two blackbody model, described in the next subsection, in which the spectra are fitted by two blackbodies at all epochs, and it is not assumed that we can see emission from the whole stellar surface.\nEssential features of the three-to-two-blackbody model are that hydrogen column density, cold blackbody temperature and cold blackbody normalization are held constant at all epochs.\nThe hot and warm blackbody components are allowed to vary independently at each epoch.\nAnother feature of the three-to-two-blackbody model is an absorption line at 1.2 keV.\n\nThe details of the fitting procedure are as follows.  \nWe began by simultaneously fitting the last fifteen {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ observations, from 2006 September 24 to 2014 March 4.\nIn this simultaneous fitting procedure, $N_{\\rm H}$, $\\textit{kT}_{\\rm{cold}}$ and the cold temperature normalization are constrained to be equal at each epoch, and the other model parameters are varied independently at each epoch until a total chi-square minimum value is found.\nThe cold blackbody component is relatively dominant over the warm component from 2006 September 24 to 2014 March 4, when we are in the two blackbody regime of the entire three-to-two-blackbody model.\nTherefore, at these later times, we obtained better (than at earlier times) constraints on the cold blackbody component normalization and temperature $\\textit{kT}_{\\rm{cold}}$, as well as the column density $N_{\\rm H}$.\nConsequently, these are the values that we chose to hold constant throughout the three-to-two-blackbody model.\nWe used the XSPEC model 'wabs', which uses abundances from \\cite{mor83}, to calculate the effects of photoelectric absorption. \nAll spectral modeling was done in the 0.3 to 10 keV energy range.\nThe best fit value of the column density is $N_{\\rm H}=(0.945\\pm0.045)\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.\nThis is significantly larger than the of value of $N_{\\rm H}=(0.72\\pm0.02)\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ found by \\cite{ber09}.\nThis discrepancy is due to the additional new data that has now been modelled by the two blackbody regime of the three-to-two-blackbody model.\n\\cite{ber09} also found $kT_{\\rm{cold}}=0.144\\pm0.003$ keV, which is statistically consistent with our measurement of $kT_{\\rm{cold}}=0.138\\pm0.006$ keV.\nFor this two blackbody model simultaneous fit we obtained a reduced chi-square value of 1.15 for 804 degrees of freedom. \n\nNext we simultaneously fit the first seven {\\it XMM-Newton} \\ observations, from 2003 September 8 to  2006 March 12.\nFor this three blackbody model, we obtained a reduced chi-square value of 1.16 for 775 degrees of freedom.  \nAn absorption feature at 1.2 keV was included in all of the fits described here.  \nBelow we describe the significance of this feature and the details of how it was incorporated into the three-to-two-blackbody model.\n\nThe absorption feature at 1.2 keV was modeled with a Gaussian absorption line with the optical depth profile\n", "index": 1, "text":
