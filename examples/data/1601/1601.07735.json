accretion center, \nand $D$ the distance of the compact object from the center of the companion.\n\n\nThe observed average X-ray luminosity of ${\\sim}4\\times10^{36}\\,$erg/s is consistent \nwith a wind-fed accreting pulsar scenario (see Eq.~\\ref{eq:1}).\nHowever, it is typical of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~to show \"off-states\" in which it becomes faint \nfor several $10^2 - 10^3\\,$s, and \"giant flares\", when the source flux \nsuddenly increases up to a factor of $20$ \\citep{Kreykenbohm+08, Sidoli+15}.\nDensity inhomogeneities are observed in the matter during the accretion stage \n(see \\citealt{Martinez+14}, and references therein) and are considered a possible \nreason for the observed X-ray flux variability.\n\nOrbital phase-resolved studies of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}, both observational and theoretical \n(see \\citealt{Blondin+91}, and references therein), provide evidence of \na strong systematic modulation of the absorbing column density with orbital phase.\nThis is also observed in other HMXBs (see the seminal case of Cen X--3, \\citealt{Jackson75},\nand more recently, the study of IGR~J$17252$--$3616$, \\citealt{Manousakis+12}).\nSuch an effect is generally attributed to the NS influence on the stellar wind by various mechanisms.\nThese include the formation of a tidal stream trailing the NS (due to the almost \nfilled Roche lobe of the companion), the X-ray photoionization of the wind \n(which leads to the formation of a Str{\\\"o}mgren sphere and a photoionization wake), \nand an accretion wake that surrounds the compact object \n(due to the focusing of the stellar wind medium by the NS gravitational influence).\nA sketch of the binary system where all these structures are illustrated is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:system}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/vela_sketch.eps}\n\\caption{Orbital sketch of the binary system {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~as observed from Earth.

conjunction (e.g., \\citealt{Eadie+75}, \\citealt{Watson+77}, \\citealt{Nagase89}).\nAt the same time, the emission from the optical companion also shows modulation with the orbital phase.\nAn absorption feature was reported by \\citet{Smith01}, who observed a dip in the {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~UV light curve \naround the transit phase ($0.46<\\phi<0.70$ in their work, where $\\phi=0$ is the mid-eclipse).\nMoreover, \\citet{Goldstein+04}, analyzing spectroscopic \\textit{Chandra} \ndata taken at three different phases (i.e., eclipse $\\phi=0$, $\\phi=0.25$ and $\\phi=0.5$), \nfound an absorbed ``eclipse-like'' spectrum at $\\phi=0.5$ in the soft X-ray energy range.\nSimilarly, \\citet{Watanabe+06} found an extended structure of dense \nmaterial that partially covers the X-ray pulsar, which is between the X-ray emitter \nand the observer at the inferior conjunction.\nMore recently, \\citet{Naik+09} analyzed orbital phase-resolved spectra of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~observed with RXTE, \nfinding large variation of the absorbing column density along the orbital phase (up to $10^{24}\\,$cm$^{-2}$), \nbut their observations do not cover the whole orbit, that is, their data do not \ninclude observations between the inferior conjunction and the apastron.\nFinally, \\citet{Doroshenko+13} have shown that the observed increasing absorption at late orbital phase does not agree \nwith expectations for a spherically symmetric smooth wind.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/sketch_velax1.eps}\n\\caption{Sketch of the binary system

years.\nWe extract a sample of double-peaked orbital profiles in two energy bands, whose dip is around the inferior conjunction.\nWe perform orbital phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy with different models \nand analyze our results using the most recent stellar wind accretion scenarios.\n\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\n\\section{Observations and data}\n\\input{Tables/setting.tex}\n\nThe all-sky monitor {\\emph{MAXI}}~\\citep{Matsuoka+09} is operating from the \nInternational Space Station (ISS) since August 2009.\nIt consists of two slit cameras working in two complementary \nenergy bands: the Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC, \\citealt{Tomida+11}) \nin the $0.7-10\\,$keV, and the Gas Slit Camera (GSC, \\citealt{Mihara+11}) \nin the $2-20\\,$keV energy bands.\nHere we only used archival GSC data.\nThe GSC module is composed of $12$ proportional counters, each of which \nconsists of a one-dimensional slit-slat collimator and a proportional counter filled with Xe-gas.\nAssembled, they allow covering a field of view of $1.5\\times160\\,$deg$^2$, observing about $75\\%$ \nof the whole sky at each ISS revolution (${\\sim}92\\,$min), and $95\\%$ per day.\nThe GSC typically scans a point source on the sky for $40-150\\,$s during each ISS revolution \n(the actual time depends on the source incident angle for each GSC counter).\nThe daily flux source sensitivity at $5\\sigma$ c.l. in the full energy band is about $20\\,$mCrab, \nand the $1\\sigma$ c.l. energy resolution is $18\\%$ at $5.9\\,$keV \\citep{Sugizaki+11}.\nThese properties allowed frequently observing {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~along its \norbit and to collecting data from this source for more than four years.\n\nWe extracted spectra and light curves of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~from GSC data covering almost \nthe whole {\\emph{MAXI}}~operation time, that is, from $55133$ to $56674\\,$MJD (see Table~\\ref{tab:setting}).\nOur data were properly corrected to account for the time-dependent effective area of the cameras.\nAll extracted spectra were rebinned to contain at least 200 photons per energy bin.\nFollowing the {\\emph{MAXI}}~team recommendation, we added a systematic error at a level of $1\\%$ \nto the final count rates of the extracted spectra.\n\n\\label{sec:observation}\n\n\\section{Orbital profiles samples

triangles) energy ranges.\n\tThe horizontal bars indicate the phase-bin.\n\tThe mid-eclipse time is taken as the phase zero.\n\tThe three orbital phase bins (X, Y, and Z) used for the phase-resolved spectroscopy \n\tof the double-peaked sample are indicated (see text).\n\t(A color version of this figure is available in the online journal).}\n\\label{fig:profiles}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe mission-long light curve of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~as observed by {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC \nis provided by the {\\emph{MAXI}}~team\\footnote{The entire {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~light curve \ncan be explored at \\url{http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.php?cid=1&jname=J0902-405}}\nat different energy ranges.\nIt exhibits a rich variety of timing phenomena.\nHowever, we here focus on the orbital properties of the source.\nWe therefore extracted {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC light curves with a time resolution of \n$6\\,$h in two energy bands, $4-10$ and $10-20\\,$keV.\nThen, we folded the light curves to produce average orbital profiles in \nthe two chosen energy bands, using the orbital ephemeris from \\citet{Kreykenbohm+08} \nthat we report in Table~\\ref{tab:setting}.\nThe phase zero is taken at the mid-eclipse time (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:sketch}).\nThe resulting orbital light curves are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:profiles}, \nwhere the strongest changes are observed in the softer band light curve.\nThis is explained as strong absorption column modulation along the binary orbit.\n\nSuccessively, we considered the difference between individual orbital \nlight curves (defined as the members of the sample) and the average orbital \nprofile (defined as the template).\nTo obtain a smooth template of the two folded light curves, we interpolated with \na cubic spline function between all the pairs of consecutive data points \n(the knots) of the light curves.\n\nFrom our line of sight, the accretion wake effects are more prominent for about $0.2$ \nin orbital phase (i.e., about $1.5\\,$days) around the inferior conjunction (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:sketch}).\nTo properly sample these effects, we defined three orbital phase bins that we call X, Y, and Z, \ncorresponding to phase intervals $0.15-0.35$, $0.35-0.55$, and $0.55-0.75$, \nrespectively (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:profiles}).\nFor analogous reasons we imposed for each member a minimum number of data points \nin each phase bin equal to $4$ (i.e., $1\\,$d observation), \nwhich leaves us with a total of $84$ statistically acceptable cycles.\nThis allowed us to perform a systematic analysis of those members that differ from \nthe template in each of the three defined phase bins.\nFor the systematic comparison of the members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 profile against the template, \nwe considered only the relative shape, avoiding any bias from flux variation.\nFor this reason, we normalized\neach member with a normalization factor equal to the ratio of the average count rate \nbetween $0.10-0.85$ and the template average count rate in the same phase interval.\nSuccessively, we subtracted the count rates of the template from the count rates of \neach member in the X, Y, and Z phase bins.\nTo evaluate the template and the member count rate in each phase bin, we calculated \nthe median of the data points.\nThe obtained count rate difference is referred to as the residuals \nwith respect to the template.\nThe residuals of the members from the template for the Y phase-bin in the \n$4-10\\,$keV energy band are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:3D}.\nThis plot shows a scattered distribution of the residuals, as expected because of \nthe high variability of the source.\nHowever, the plot also clearly shows that residuals tend to cluster toward negative values.\nTherefore, we performed a new analysis and stacked only those members \nthat had high ($>30\\%$) negative residuals (i.e., $<-0.0345\\,$cnt/s) in the Y phase bins \nand at the same time low ($<30\\%$) residuals in the X and Z phase bins.\nThis allowed us to obtain a new average orbital profile in the $4-10\\,$keV \nenergy band, made of $12$ out of $84$ total orbital cycles (i.e., about $15\\%$ \nof the analyzed cycles).\nThis is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_profiles}.\nUsing a different definition of the residuals, where the ratio between \nthe median values is taken (instead of their difference), shows the very same trend \nas that in Fig.~\\ref{fig:3D}, and leads to the same selected profiles.\n\nSince our normalization procedure could remove flux-dependent features, \nwe carefully verified that these selected profiles were not associated with a specific \nluminosity level before normalization.\nIn addition, for all of these $12$ selected profiles, the null hypothesis was tested \nagainst the template with normality tests ($\\chi^2$, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk) \nand was rejected at a significance level higher than $3\\sigma$.\nFurthermore, they all show a median value in the Y phase-bin that deviates \nat least $3\\sigma$ from the template.\nThese profiles are characterized by a double-peak shape and a flux drop \naround the inferior conjunction.\nWe refer to them as the double-peaked sample.\n\nSimilar results are obtained if the same procedure is performed in the $10-20\\,$keV energy band.\nIn this case, the selected profiles are $11$ out of $84$.\nThe overall profile shape is very similar to the profile obtained in the $4-10\\,$keV energy band,\nwith a double-peak morphology and a dip around the inferior conjunction.\nThe extracted sample in the $10-20\\,$keV energy band is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_profiles}.\n\nFinally, we extracted another independent sample in the two energy bands by \nstacking all the statistically acceptable orbital profiles except for the \ndouble-peaked members in each respective energy band.\nWe refer to this sample as the standard sample.\nThe standard sample orbital profiles in the two energy bands are shown with dashed lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_profiles}.\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/ResY_vs_Time.eps}\n\\caption{\n\tResiduals of single orbital profiles

performed separately \nfor the two samples defined in Sect.~\\ref{sec:Population}.\nBecause the physical problem is complex, a fully physical model of the X-ray production \nmechanism in accreting X-ray pulsars has not been implemented so far.\nTherefore, an empirical model has to be used.\nFollowing the common empirical model used in the literature (see, e.g., \\citealt{Schanne+07}), \nwe adopted a cutoff power-law model (\\textit{cutoffpl} in XSPEC)\n\nto which a blackbody component was added to account for soft excess \n(see \\citealt{Hickox+04} and references therein).\nOn the other hand, to account for the expected inhomogeneous structure of the ambient wind in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}},\nwe also tested the partial covering model (\\textit{pcfabs*powerlaw} in XSPEC)\ncharacterized by a local absorbing component ($N_{\\rm H}^{pc}$) that affects \nonly a fraction $f$ of the original spectrum.\nThis model has also been successfully used to fit \\textit{NuStar} data of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~\\citep{Fuerst+14}.\nTo both models, photoelectric absorption by neutral matter \\citep{Morrison+McCammon83}\nwas added, to account for the absorption column density ($N_{\\rm H}$) \nalong the entire line of sight.\nWe assumed solar abundances by \\citet{Anders+Grevesse89} for this.\nUsing the metal abundances of \\citet{Kaper+93} for HD~$77581$ \n(i.e., sub-solar C, and super-solar N, Al)\ndoes not affect our results, which are well consistent within $1\\sigma$.\nTherefore, we used solar abundances throughout the rest of the analysis.\nWe also added two iron Gaussian line components \\citep{Odaka+13}, K$\\alpha$ and \nK$\\beta$ at $6.4$ and $7.08\\,$keV..\nThe same components were included in the models used for the phase-resolved spectroscopy.\nThe results of the fits are given in Table~\\ref{tab:averaged}.\nBoth models return acceptable fits for the standard and the double-peaked sample.\nHowever, for the standard sample, the partial covering model describes the data not as well as the cutoff power-law model.\n\n\n\n\\label{sec:spectral}\n\n\\section{Phase-resolved spectral analysis}\n\n\\subsection{Orbital phase-resolved spectroscopy of the double-peaked sample}\\label{subsec:double_prs}\n\nTo investigate the nature of the dip in the double-peaked sample,\nwe extracted X-ray spectra of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~in the X, Y and Z orbital phase bins.\nFor this, we filtered {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC data with GTIs corresponding to the \nthree phase bins in the double-peaked profiles (see Sect.~\\ref{sec:Population}).\nBased on the results from Sect.~\\ref{sec:spectral}, we used the same models as were \napplied in the phase-averaged case to fit the orbital phase-resolved spectra:\n(a) a cutoff power-law model plus a blackbody component, and (b) a partial covering model.\nTo avoid unphysical best-fit solutions when model (a) was used,\nwe fixed the cutoff energy and the blackbody temperature\nto their respective phase-averaged values.\nFor model (a) we also compared the results for a fixed (to the phase-averaged value, \n$\\Gamma=0.27$, see Table~\\ref{tab:averaged}) or free photon index.\nWe found that the model with free photon index is statistically preferable ($\\Delta\\chi^2>20$).\n\nFurthermore, fitting the Y phase bin spectrum, the model with a fixed photon index leads \nto unphysically high values of the blackbody normalization (to compensate for the soft excess).\nThus, we did not consider the cutoff power-law model with a fixed photon index a viable \nmodel in our analysis (similar considerations hold for the phase-resolved spectroscopy of \nthe standard sample, see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs}).\nIt is often possible to find a statistically equivalent solution for model (b) \nwhere the partial covering component is not necessary.\nWe tested the significance of the partial covering component with the F-test,\nincluding such a component only when it was significant at a $99\\%$ c.l.\nOtherwise, we preferred the solutions where the partial covering component was not included.\nThe same criterion was adopted for the standard sample case (see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs})\n\nModels (a) and (b) both return a good fit, and the results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}.\nModel (a) shows orbital modulation of the spectral photon index $\\Gamma$.\nTo better explore the spectral variation, we produced $\\chi^2$-contour plots of \n$\\Gamma$ and $N_{\\rm H}$ in the three phase bins (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursdouble}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/countors-cutoff.eps}\n\\caption{$\\chi^2$ contour plots for the {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~double-peaked sample fitted \n\twith an absorbed cutoff power-law model including a blackbody component (model \\textit{a}, see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}).\n\tThe ellipses are $\\chi^2$-contours for two parameters ($N_{\\rm H}$ and $\\Gamma$).\n\tThe contours correspond to $\\chi^{2}_{\\rm min} + 1.0$ (the projections of this contour to the parameter \n\taxes correspond to the $68\\%$ uncertainty for one parameter of interest), $\\chi^{2}_{\\rm min} + 2.3$ \n\t($68\\%$ uncertainty for two parameters of interest), and $\\chi^{2}_{\\rm min} + 4.61$ ($90\\%$ uncertainty \n\tfor two parameters of interest). The respective orbital phase bins are indicated.}\n\\label{fig:contoursdouble}\n\\end{figure}\n\nConversely, model (b) does not show photon index modulation along the orbital phase,\nalthough it shows variation of the column density.\nA plot of the double-peaked phase-resolved spectra fit with the partial covering \nmodel is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_sim_shifted}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Orbital phase-resolved spectroscopy of the standard sample}\\label{subsec:standard_prs}\n\n\\input{Tables/average_fits.tex}\n\\input{Tables/doubleprs.tex}\n\nSimilarly to the double-peaked sample, we performed orbital phase-resolved \nspectroscopy of the standard sample.\nHowever, for this sample, the statistics is much higher than in the previous case, \nso that a finer binning is possible.\nWe divided the standard sample profile into seven phase bins, each one wide $0.1$ in phase, from $0.1$ to $0.8$.\nPhase bins around the eclipse time are not suitable for our purpouses \nand suffer from lower statistics, therefore they were not analyzed in our work.\nThe analyzed phase bins are labeled $\\phi_{\\rm i}$, with $i=1, ..., 7$.\nThen we filtered our data with GTIs corresponding to the seven orbital phase bins \nand extracted orbital phase-resolved spectra of the standard sample.\nBased on the results from Sect.~\\ref{sec:spectral}, we fit the phase-resolved spectra \nwith the same two models: (a) a cutoff power-law with a blackbody component, \nand (b) a partial covering model.\nTo avoid unphysical best-fit solutions, we fixed the cutoff energy and the blackbody temperature \nof model (a) to their respective phase-averaged value.\nAs already mentioned in Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs}, model (b) returns two statistically \nequivalent solutions: one where the partial covering component is statistically significant,\nand the other where the same component is not necessary.\nIn such cases, we adopted the solution in which the partial covering component \nwas not required, unless it was significant at a $99\\%$ c.l.\nThe results are given in Table~\\ref{tab:prs_standard}.\nAll phase-resolved spectra return good fits for each of the two tested models.\nHowever, the cutoff power-law model with blackbody shows a marked modulation of the \nspectral photon index $\\Gamma$ along the orbital phase.\nThe trend of this modulation is similar to that observed for the double-peaked sample \n(see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs}).\nFor a deeper investigation of these results, $\\chi^2$-contour plots of $\\Gamma$ and $N_{\\rm H}$ \nwere produced (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursaverage}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/standard_contours_cutoff.eps}\n\\caption{$\\chi^2$ contour plots for the {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~standard sample fitted with an absorbed cutoff power-law model \n\tincluding a blackbody component (see Table~\\ref{tab:prs_standard}).\n\tSymbols are the same as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursdouble}.\n\tThe respective orbital phase bins are indicated.}\n\\label{fig:contoursaverage}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe partial covering model shows only marginal variation of the photon index $\\Gamma$,\nwhile the column density clearly changes along the orbital phase,\nand the covering fraction is consistent with a constant value.\nA plot of the standard sample phase-resolved spectra fit with the partial covering \nmodel is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:standard_sim_shifted}.\n\\input{Tables/prs_standard.tex}\n\n\\label{sec:analysis:prs}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe main observational results of our work can be summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item About $15\\%$ of the orbital light curves in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~shows a double-peaked orbital profile, \n      with a dip around the inferior conjunction, both in the $4-10\\,$keV and $10-20\\,$keV energy bands;\n\n\\item orbital phase-resolved spectra of both the double-peaked and the standard sample are well fit by \n      a cutoff power-law model and by a partial covering model;\n\n\\item the cutoff power-law model leads to orbital modulation of both \n\tthe spectral photon index and the column density;\n\n\\item a partial covering model fits the data equally well.\n      No orbital modulation of the spectral photon index is observed in this case.\n      In contrast, orbital modulation of the column density is observed.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn the following we discuss our results within the context of the most recent \nwind accretion scenarios that have been proposed for {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}.\n\n\\subsection{Double-peaked orbital light curve}\\label{subsec:doublelc}\n\nIndications of a double-peaked orbital light curve in Vela~X-1 have already been reported\nby earliest observations of the source with \\textit{Ariel V} \\citep{Eadie+75, Watson+77}.\nBased on \\textit{Tenma} data, \\citet{Nagase89} found an increase of the \ncolumn density along the NS orbit, in particular after the transit phase.\n\\citet{Blondin+91} took both gravitational and radiative effects into account and \nreproduced the observed orbital phase dependence of the column density.\nThey found that an accretion wake that extends toward the observer's line \nof sight at the inferior conjunction produces a local peak in the \ncolumn density absorption along the binary orbit.\n\nIntriguing evidence on the accretion wake in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~was obtained by \\citet{Smith01},\nwho inferred that a hot source around the transit phase of the NS is present by \nanalyzing He\\,$\\lambda1640$ absorption line strengths.\nBased on \\textit{Chandra} X-ray data, \\citet{Watanabe+06} also have inferred the presence \nof a dense cloud obscuring the compact source at the inferior conjunction.\nAll these results are tightly related to the observational features reported in this work.\n\nThe sample of double-peaked orbital profiles, obtained from the very long \n\\textit{MAXI/GSC} monitoring of Vela X-1, shows a remarkable dip at phase Y, \nalso in the $10-20\\,$keV band. \nThis is challenging to explain solely by invoking absorption from neutral matter.\nThe X-ray flux observed at the dip phase is about half of the flux in the \nstandard sample at the same phase (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:profiles}).\nTo halve a luminosity of ${\\sim}4\\times10^{36}\\,$erg/s in the $10-20\\,$keV band, \na column density value of $N_H\\,{\\sim}\\,2\\times10^{24}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ is needed,\n${\\sim}10$ times higher than what is observed in our study.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[angle=270, width=\\hsize]{Figures/nuovo.eps} \n\\caption{Orbital phase-resolved spectra of the double-peaked sample fitted with \n\ta partial covering model, when significant (see text).\n\tThe top panel shows from top to bottom data and folded model of the three spectra \n\tin phase bins X, Y,  and Z.\n\tThe spectra have been multiplied by the factor shown above each curve \n\ton the left side for better visualization.\n\tThe bottom panel shows the residuals for the best-fit model.\n\tSee Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs} for all spectral parameters.\n\t}\n\\label{fig:double_sim_shifted}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn addition, hydrodynamical simulations of stellar winds in HMXBs \n(\\citealt{Blondin+91}, \\citealt{Manousakis+12}) predict a local peak of the \ncolumn density $N_{\\rm H}$ around the inferior conjunction on the order of \n$10^{23}\\,$cm$^{-2}$.\nThis agrees with our observations.\nWe also mention that the {\\emph{INTEGRAL}}~analysis of \\citet{Fuerst+10} highlights a possible \ndip-like feature around the transit in the phase-resolved flux histograms of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~at \n$20-60\\,$keV, that is, at an energy band that is almost unaffected by absorption.\nOur conclusion is therefore that some additional mechanism must be at work \nthat contributes to the flux reduction at the inferior conjunction, \nand that is triggered only in a limited sample of orbital cycles.\n\nA contribution to the observed reduced flux could come from the Compton scattering \nat the low-energy limit, where the cross section is characterized by only a weak dependence \non the photon energy and can be approximated by the Thomson scattering cross section \n($\\sigma_T=6.65\\times10^{-25}\\,$cm$^{2}$).\nTo efficiently scatter X-rays from the accreting pulsar, \nthe surroundings of the compact object need to be ionized and dense enough.\nHydrodynamical 2D and 3D simulations of the stellar wind in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~by \\citet{Mauche+08} showed that \nthe interaction of the wind with the NS leads to strong variations of the wind parameters.\nThese authors found that the accretion wake reaches high temperatures (${\\sim}10^8\\,$K) \nand a high ionization parameter ($\\xi=L_x / (n\\,R_{\\rm ion}^2)\\sim10^4\\,$erg\\,cm\\,s$^{-1}$,\nwhere $n$ is the number density at a given point, while $R_{\\rm ion}$ \nis the distance from this point to the X-ray source).\n\nThe accretion wake extends to scales on the order of the optical companion size \n($R\\sim10^{12}\\,$cm) with a number density of ${\\sim}10^{9-12}\\,$cm$^{-3}$,\nwhich, taking an average value of $n\\sim10^{10}\\,$cm$^{-3}$,\nleads to a column density of ${\\sim}10^{23}\\,$cm$^{-2}$.\nThis is similar to the values obtained from our spectral analysis \nof the double-peaked sample in the Y phase bin \n(see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs_results} and Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}). \nMoreover, the bremsstrahlung cooling time is about $10^{11}\\sqrt{T}/n$~s \n\\citep{Rybicki+Lightman79} that is, ${\\sim}10^5\\,$s, or about one day, \nwhich agrees with the observed time duration of the dip.\nIn other words, the gas stays ionized for a time long enough to allow Thomson scattering.\nThe ionized gas is not traced by the spectral absorption in the soft X-ray band.\nNonetheless, its electron density $n$ is high enough to result in an optical depth value of \n$\\tau=n\\,l\\,\\sigma_T=0.5-0.7$ (where $l=2\\times10^{12}\\,$cm is the length of the accretion wake).\nThus, when the ionized stream of the accretion wake passes through the observer's direction, \nthat is, during the transit, a substantial part of the X-ray radiation can be efficiently \nscattered out of our line of sight.\nThis scenario is further supported by the normalization of the power-law component,\nwhich appears to be modulated along the orbit (see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}),\nindicating an intrinsically dimmer flux at the inferior conjunction\n(although large parameter uncertainties need to be considered).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,

then be responsible for the modifications of the accretion wake,\nwhich in turn modify the orbital light curve shape, alternating between a double-peaked and a standard morphology.\nWe therefore conclude that the ionized gas in the hot accretion wake,\ncombined with its high column density, is a possible cause for the dip that is observed \nat the inferior conjunction in the double-peaked sample light curves.\n\n\\subsection{Spectral results}\n\n\\subsubsection{Orbital phase-averaged spectroscopy}\\label{subsec:phase_average_results}\n\nOrbital phase-averaged spectra  in the $2-20\\,$keV energy range \nof both the double-peaked and the standard sample were modeled \nwith a cutoff power-law model, adding a blackbody component to account for the soft excess,\nand with partial covering (Table~\\ref{tab:averaged}).\nFor the double-peaked sample, both models return a good fit.\nFor the standard sample the partial covering model is only marginally acceptable, \nwhile the cutoff power-law describes the data well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the inhomogeneous environment in which the NS travels along the binary orbit,\nour phase-averaged results are not straightforward in terms of physical interpretation.\nInstead, these results were used to avoid unphysical best-fit solutions \nof the orbital phase-resolved spectra, fixing some of the model parameters \nto their phase-averaged value (see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs_results} \nand Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs_results}).\n\n\\subsubsection{Double-peaked sample phase-resolved spectroscopy}\\label{subsec:double_prs_results}\n\nFitting the phase-resolved spectra of the double-peaked sample\nwith a cutoff power-law results in orbital modulation of the photon index \n(see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}), which has never been observed in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~to the best of our knowledge.\nThe spectrum becomes harder at the inferior conjunction (Y phase bin) \nthan at earlier and later phases (X and Z phase bins, respectively).\nContour plots for $N_{\\rm H}$ and $\\Gamma$ (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursdouble})\nappear clearly distinct from one phase bin to another,\nindicating that the modulation is not due to the intrinsic coupling between the two parameters.\n\n\\citet{Prat+08} reported photon index modulation \nalong the binary orbit of HMXB IGR~J$19140$+$0951$.\nThese authors ascribed the observed orbital modulation to a variable visibility\nof the region that produces the soft excess.\nSince we do not observe any modulation of the blackbody component,\nour study does not support this interpretation.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we did not find any reliable physical interpretation for this phenomenon.\n\nModeling with partial covering does not show an orbital modulation of the photon index.\nThis model results in absorption increase along the orbital phase \n(see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs_results} for a more comprehensive discussion of \nthis result) and in a partial covering component with high covering fraction needed \nat the Y phase bin, which is not required at earlier or later phases, however (see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}).\nA possible interpretation of these results is given by the oscillating behavior \nof the accretion wake \\citep{Blondin+90}.\nBecause of the orbit-to-orbit variations of the ambient wind, the tail of the accretion wake \nis expected to oscillate with respect to our line of sight.\nAveraging this behavior over several orbital periods would result in a large covering fraction,\nwhere the wobbling accretion wake simulates an inhomogeneous absorbing environment.\n\nA different interpretation might be that an intrinsically inhomogeneous structure \nis present around the inferior conjunction and partially covers the X-ray source.\nInhomogeneous stellar winds from supergiant stars (so-called clumps) are expected \n\\citep{Runacres+Owocki05} and observed (\\citealt{Goldstein+04}, and references therein), \nand have been suggested as the cause for {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~flaring activity \n(see \\citealt{Kreykenbohm+08} and \\citealt{Martinez+14}).\nThe timescale on which clumps hit the X-ray pulsar is on the order of the wind's dynamic timescale\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 4420, "prevtext": "\n\n   \\title{Probing the stellar wind

resulting effect is a partially covered spectrum.\nHowever, if the partial covering is due to the inhomogeneous structure of the ambient wind,\nno modulation of this component with orbital phase would occur.\nIn contrast, our results underline the necessity of partial covering only for the \nY phase bin spectra, where the obscuration effect of the accretion wake is maximized.\nHydrodynamical simulations \\citep{Blondin+90, Blondin+91} revealed that the accretion wake \nis composed of compressed filaments of gas and rarefied bubbles.\nMoreover, recent models also showed that density perturbations in stellar winds of OB stars \nonly develop at distances larger than the NS orbital radius in Vela X-1\n($r\\sim1.1\\,R_{\\star}$, see Fig.~$2$ in \\citealt{Sundqvist+Owocki13}).\nTherefore, intrinsic stellar wind clumps around the X-ray pulsar could be not \nstructured enough to trigger the observed high X-ray flux variability.\nInstead, the inhomogeneous structure characteristic of the accretion wake trailing the NS\nindicates that the compact object could be able to perturb the ambient wind \nsuch that clumps are formed at its passage. \nThe sphere of influence of the X-ray pulsar is dictated by its accretion radius, \n$r_{\\rm acc}{\\sim}10^{11}\\,$cm \\citep{Feldmeier+96} and by the Str{\\\"o}mgren sphere \ndefined by the photoionization parameter $\\xi=L_x / (n\\,R_{\\rm ion}^2)$, \nwhich leads (see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:doublelc} for parameter definitions and values)\nto a photoionization radius $R_{\\rm ion}\\sim0.2R_B\\sim6\\times10^{11}\\,$cm\\,$\\sim r_{\\rm acc}$.\nSince the orbital velocity of the NS is $v_{\\rm orbit}\\approx280\\,$km/s,\nthe perturbation timescale is about \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 39148, "prevtext": "\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant, $R_{\\rm NS}\\sim10\\,$km is the NS radius, \n$v_{\\rm rel}$ the relative velocity of the wind seen from the accretion center, \nand $D$ the distance of the compact object from the center of the companion.\n\n\nThe observed average X-ray luminosity of ${\\sim}4\\times10^{36}\\,$erg/s is consistent \nwith a wind-fed accreting pulsar scenario (see Eq.~\\ref{eq:1}).\nHowever, it is typical of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~to show \"off-states\" in which it becomes faint \nfor several $10^2 - 10^3\\,$s, and \"giant flares\", when the source flux \nsuddenly increases up to a factor of $20$ \\citep{Kreykenbohm+08, Sidoli+15}.\nDensity inhomogeneities are observed in the matter during the accretion stage \n(see \\citealt{Martinez+14}, and references therein) and are considered a possible \nreason for the observed X-ray flux variability.\n\nOrbital phase-resolved studies of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}, both observational and theoretical \n(see \\citealt{Blondin+91}, and references therein), provide evidence of \na strong systematic modulation of the absorbing column density with orbital phase.\nThis is also observed in other HMXBs (see the seminal case of Cen X--3, \\citealt{Jackson75},\nand more recently, the study of IGR~J$17252$--$3616$, \\citealt{Manousakis+12}).\nSuch an effect is generally attributed to the NS influence on the stellar wind by various mechanisms.\nThese include the formation of a tidal stream trailing the NS (due to the almost \nfilled Roche lobe of the companion), the X-ray photoionization of the wind \n(which leads to the formation of a Str{\\\"o}mgren sphere and a photoionization wake), \nand an accretion wake that surrounds the compact object \n(due to the focusing of the stellar wind medium by the NS gravitational influence).\nA sketch of the binary system where all these structures are illustrated is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:system}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/vela_sketch.eps}\n\\caption{Orbital sketch of the binary system {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~as observed from Earth.

conjunction (e.g., \\citealt{Eadie+75}, \\citealt{Watson+77}, \\citealt{Nagase89}).\nAt the same time, the emission from the optical companion also shows modulation with the orbital phase.\nAn absorption feature was reported by \\citet{Smith01}, who observed a dip in the {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~UV light curve \naround the transit phase ($0.46<\\phi<0.70$ in their work, where $\\phi=0$ is the mid-eclipse).\nMoreover, \\citet{Goldstein+04}, analyzing spectroscopic \\textit{Chandra} \ndata taken at three different phases (i.e., eclipse $\\phi=0$, $\\phi=0.25$ and $\\phi=0.5$), \nfound an absorbed ``eclipse-like'' spectrum at $\\phi=0.5$ in the soft X-ray energy range.\nSimilarly, \\citet{Watanabe+06} found an extended structure of dense \nmaterial that partially covers the X-ray pulsar, which is between the X-ray emitter \nand the observer at the inferior conjunction.\nMore recently, \\citet{Naik+09} analyzed orbital phase-resolved spectra of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~observed with RXTE, \nfinding large variation of the absorbing column density along the orbital phase (up to $10^{24}\\,$cm$^{-2}$), \nbut their observations do not cover the whole orbit, that is, their data do not \ninclude observations between the inferior conjunction and the apastron.\nFinally, \\citet{Doroshenko+13} have shown that the observed increasing absorption at late orbital phase does not agree \nwith expectations for a spherically symmetric smooth wind.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/sketch_velax1.eps}\n\\caption{Sketch of the binary system

years.\nWe extract a sample of double-peaked orbital profiles in two energy bands, whose dip is around the inferior conjunction.\nWe perform orbital phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy with different models \nand analyze our results using the most recent stellar wind accretion scenarios.\n\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\n\\section{Observations and data}\n\\input{Tables/setting.tex}\n\nThe all-sky monitor {\\emph{MAXI}}~\\citep{Matsuoka+09} is operating from the \nInternational Space Station (ISS) since August 2009.\nIt consists of two slit cameras working in two complementary \nenergy bands: the Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC, \\citealt{Tomida+11}) \nin the $0.7-10\\,$keV, and the Gas Slit Camera (GSC, \\citealt{Mihara+11}) \nin the $2-20\\,$keV energy bands.\nHere we only used archival GSC data.\nThe GSC module is composed of $12$ proportional counters, each of which \nconsists of a one-dimensional slit-slat collimator and a proportional counter filled with Xe-gas.\nAssembled, they allow covering a field of view of $1.5\\times160\\,$deg$^2$, observing about $75\\%$ \nof the whole sky at each ISS revolution (${\\sim}92\\,$min), and $95\\%$ per day.\nThe GSC typically scans a point source on the sky for $40-150\\,$s during each ISS revolution \n(the actual time depends on the source incident angle for each GSC counter).\nThe daily flux source sensitivity at $5\\sigma$ c.l. in the full energy band is about $20\\,$mCrab, \nand the $1\\sigma$ c.l. energy resolution is $18\\%$ at $5.9\\,$keV \\citep{Sugizaki+11}.\nThese properties allowed frequently observing {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~along its \norbit and to collecting data from this source for more than four years.\n\nWe extracted spectra and light curves of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~from GSC data covering almost \nthe whole {\\emph{MAXI}}~operation time, that is, from $55133$ to $56674\\,$MJD (see Table~\\ref{tab:setting}).\nOur data were properly corrected to account for the time-dependent effective area of the cameras.\nAll extracted spectra were rebinned to contain at least 200 photons per energy bin.\nFollowing the {\\emph{MAXI}}~team recommendation, we added a systematic error at a level of $1\\%$ \nto the final count rates of the extracted spectra.\n\n\\label{sec:observation}\n\n\\section{Orbital profiles samples

triangles) energy ranges.\n\tThe horizontal bars indicate the phase-bin.\n\tThe mid-eclipse time is taken as the phase zero.\n\tThe three orbital phase bins (X, Y, and Z) used for the phase-resolved spectroscopy \n\tof the double-peaked sample are indicated (see text).\n\t(A color version of this figure is available in the online journal).}\n\\label{fig:profiles}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe mission-long light curve of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~as observed by {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC \nis provided by the {\\emph{MAXI}}~team\\footnote{The entire {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~light curve \ncan be explored at \\url{http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.php?cid=1&jname=J0902-405}}\nat different energy ranges.\nIt exhibits a rich variety of timing phenomena.\nHowever, we here focus on the orbital properties of the source.\nWe therefore extracted {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC light curves with a time resolution of \n$6\\,$h in two energy bands, $4-10$ and $10-20\\,$keV.\nThen, we folded the light curves to produce average orbital profiles in \nthe two chosen energy bands, using the orbital ephemeris from \\citet{Kreykenbohm+08} \nthat we report in Table~\\ref{tab:setting}.\nThe phase zero is taken at the mid-eclipse time (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:sketch}).\nThe resulting orbital light curves are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:profiles}, \nwhere the strongest changes are observed in the softer band light curve.\nThis is explained as strong absorption column modulation along the binary orbit.\n\nSuccessively, we considered the difference between individual orbital \nlight curves (defined as the members of the sample) and the average orbital \nprofile (defined as the template).\nTo obtain a smooth template of the two folded light curves, we interpolated with \na cubic spline function between all the pairs of consecutive data points \n(the knots) of the light curves.\n\nFrom our line of sight, the accretion wake effects are more prominent for about $0.2$ \nin orbital phase (i.e., about $1.5\\,$days) around the inferior conjunction (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:sketch}).\nTo properly sample these effects, we defined three orbital phase bins that we call X, Y, and Z, \ncorresponding to phase intervals $0.15-0.35$, $0.35-0.55$, and $0.55-0.75$, \nrespectively (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:profiles}).\nFor analogous reasons we imposed for each member a minimum number of data points \nin each phase bin equal to $4$ (i.e., $1\\,$d observation), \nwhich leaves us with a total of $84$ statistically acceptable cycles.\nThis allowed us to perform a systematic analysis of those members that differ from \nthe template in each of the three defined phase bins.\nFor the systematic comparison of the members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 profile against the template, \nwe considered only the relative shape, avoiding any bias from flux variation.\nFor this reason, we normalized\neach member with a normalization factor equal to the ratio of the average count rate \nbetween $0.10-0.85$ and the template average count rate in the same phase interval.\nSuccessively, we subtracted the count rates of the template from the count rates of \neach member in the X, Y, and Z phase bins.\nTo evaluate the template and the member count rate in each phase bin, we calculated \nthe median of the data points.\nThe obtained count rate difference is referred to as the residuals \nwith respect to the template.\nThe residuals of the members from the template for the Y phase-bin in the \n$4-10\\,$keV energy band are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:3D}.\nThis plot shows a scattered distribution of the residuals, as expected because of \nthe high variability of the source.\nHowever, the plot also clearly shows that residuals tend to cluster toward negative values.\nTherefore, we performed a new analysis and stacked only those members \nthat had high ($>30\\%$) negative residuals (i.e., $<-0.0345\\,$cnt/s) in the Y phase bins \nand at the same time low ($<30\\%$) residuals in the X and Z phase bins.\nThis allowed us to obtain a new average orbital profile in the $4-10\\,$keV \nenergy band, made of $12$ out of $84$ total orbital cycles (i.e., about $15\\%$ \nof the analyzed cycles).\nThis is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_profiles}.\nUsing a different definition of the residuals, where the ratio between \nthe median values is taken (instead of their difference), shows the very same trend \nas that in Fig.~\\ref{fig:3D}, and leads to the same selected profiles.\n\nSince our normalization procedure could remove flux-dependent features, \nwe carefully verified that these selected profiles were not associated with a specific \nluminosity level before normalization.\nIn addition, for all of these $12$ selected profiles, the null hypothesis was tested \nagainst the template with normality tests ($\\chi^2$, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk) \nand was rejected at a significance level higher than $3\\sigma$.\nFurthermore, they all show a median value in the Y

double-peaked sample.\n\nSimilar results are obtained if the same procedure is performed in the $10-20\\,$keV energy band.\nIn this case, the selected profiles are $11$ out of $84$.\nThe overall profile shape is very similar to the profile obtained in the $4-10\\,$keV energy band,\nwith a double-peak morphology and a dip around the inferior conjunction.\nThe extracted sample in the

orbital profiles except for the \ndouble-peaked members in each respective energy band.\nWe refer to this sample as the standard sample.\nThe standard sample orbital profiles in the two energy bands are shown with dashed lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_profiles}.\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/ResY_vs_Time.eps}\n\\caption{\n\tResiduals of single orbital profiles

performed separately \nfor the two samples defined in Sect.~\\ref{sec:Population}.\nBecause the physical problem is complex, a fully physical model of the X-ray production \nmechanism in accreting X-ray pulsars has not been implemented so far.\nTherefore, an empirical model has to be used.\nFollowing the common empirical model used in the literature (see, e.g., \\citealt{Schanne+07}), \nwe adopted a cutoff power-law model (\\textit{cutoffpl} in XSPEC)\n\nto which a blackbody component was added to account for soft excess \n(see \\citealt{Hickox+04} and references therein).\nOn the other hand, to account for the expected inhomogeneous structure of the ambient wind in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}},\nwe also tested the partial covering model (\\textit{pcfabs*powerlaw} in XSPEC)\ncharacterized by a local absorbing component ($N_{\\rm H}^{pc}$) that affects \nonly a fraction $f$ of the original spectrum.\nThis model has also been successfully used to fit \\textit{NuStar} data of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~\\citep{Fuerst+14}.\nTo both models, photoelectric absorption by neutral matter \\citep{Morrison+McCammon83}\nwas added, to account for the absorption column density ($N_{\\rm H}$) \nalong the entire line of sight.\nWe assumed solar abundances by \\citet{Anders+Grevesse89} for this.\nUsing the metal abundances of \\citet{Kaper+93} for HD~$77581$ \n(i.e., sub-solar C, and super-solar N, Al)\ndoes not affect our results, which are well consistent within $1\\sigma$.\nTherefore, we used solar abundances throughout the rest of the analysis.\nWe also added two iron Gaussian line components \\citep{Odaka+13}, K$\\alpha$ and \nK$\\beta$ at $6.4$ and $7.08\\,$keV..\nThe same components were included in the models used for the phase-resolved spectroscopy.\nThe results of the fits are given in Table~\\ref{tab:averaged}.\nBoth models return acceptable fits for the standard and the double-peaked sample.\nHowever, for the standard sample, the partial covering model describes the data not as well as the cutoff power-law model.\n\n\n\n\\label{sec:spectral}\n\n\\section{Phase-resolved spectral analysis}\n\n\\subsection{Orbital phase-resolved spectroscopy of the double-peaked sample}\\label{subsec:double_prs}\n\nTo investigate the nature of the dip in the double-peaked sample,\nwe extracted X-ray spectra of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~in the X, Y and Z orbital phase bins.\nFor this, we filtered {\\emph{MAXI}}/GSC data with GTIs corresponding to the \nthree phase bins in the double-peaked profiles (see Sect.~\\ref{sec:Population}).\nBased on the results from Sect.~\\ref{sec:spectral}, we used the same models as were \napplied in the phase-averaged case to fit the orbital phase-resolved spectra:\n(a) a cutoff power-law model plus a blackbody component, and (b) a partial covering model.\nTo avoid unphysical best-fit solutions when model (a) was used,\nwe fixed the cutoff energy and the blackbody temperature\nto their respective phase-averaged values.\nFor model (a) we also compared the results for a fixed (to the phase-averaged value, \n$\\Gamma=0.27$, see Table~\\ref{tab:averaged}) or free photon index.\nWe found that the model with free photon index is statistically preferable ($\\Delta\\chi^2>20$).\n\nFurthermore, fitting the Y phase bin spectrum, the model with a fixed photon index leads \nto unphysically high values of the blackbody normalization (to compensate for the soft excess).\nThus, we did not consider the cutoff power-law model with a fixed photon index a viable \nmodel in our analysis (similar considerations hold for the phase-resolved spectroscopy of \nthe standard sample, see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs}).\nIt is often possible to find a statistically equivalent solution for model (b) \nwhere the partial covering component is not necessary.\nWe tested the significance of the partial covering component with the F-test,\nincluding such a component only when it was significant at a $99\\%$ c.l.\nOtherwise, we preferred the solutions where the partial covering component was not included.\nThe same criterion was adopted for the standard sample case (see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs})\n\nModels (a) and (b) both return a good fit, and the results are shown in Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}.\nModel (a) shows orbital modulation of the spectral photon index $\\Gamma$.\nTo better explore the spectral variation, we produced $\\chi^2$-contour plots of \n$\\Gamma$ and $N_{\\rm H}$ in the three phase bins (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursdouble}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/countors-cutoff.eps}\n\\caption{$\\chi^2$ contour plots for the {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~double-peaked sample fitted \n\twith an absorbed cutoff power-law model including a blackbody component (model \\textit{a}, see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}).\n\tThe ellipses are $\\chi^2$-contours for two parameters ($N_{\\rm H}$ and $\\Gamma$).\n\tThe contours correspond to $\\chi^{2}_{\\rm min} + 1.0$ (the projections of this contour to the parameter \n\taxes correspond to the $68\\%$ uncertainty for one parameter of interest), $\\chi^{2}_{\\rm min} + 2.3$ \n\t($68\\%$ uncertainty for two parameters of interest), and $\\chi^{2}_{\\rm min} + 4.61$ ($90\\%$ uncertainty \n\tfor two parameters of interest). The respective orbital phase bins are indicated.}\n\\label{fig:contoursdouble}\n\\end{figure}\n\nConversely, model (b) does not show photon index modulation along the orbital phase,\nalthough it shows variation of the column density.\nA plot of the double-peaked phase-resolved spectra fit with the partial covering \nmodel is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_sim_shifted}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Orbital phase-resolved spectroscopy of the standard sample}\\label{subsec:standard_prs}\n\n\\input{Tables/average_fits.tex}\n\\input{Tables/doubleprs.tex}\n\nSimilarly to the double-peaked sample, we performed orbital phase-resolved \nspectroscopy of the standard sample.\nHowever, for this sample, the statistics is much higher than in the previous case, \nso that a finer binning is possible.\nWe divided the standard sample profile into seven phase bins, each one wide $0.1$ in phase, from $0.1$ to $0.8$.\nPhase bins around the eclipse time are not suitable for our purpouses \nand suffer from lower statistics, therefore they were not analyzed in our work.\nThe analyzed phase bins are labeled $\\phi_{\\rm i}$, with $i=1, ..., 7$.\nThen we filtered our data with GTIs corresponding to the seven orbital phase bins \nand extracted orbital phase-resolved spectra of the standard sample.\nBased on the results from Sect.~\\ref{sec:spectral}, we fit the phase-resolved spectra \nwith the same two models: (a) a cutoff power-law with a blackbody component, \nand (b) a partial covering model.\nTo avoid unphysical best-fit solutions, we fixed the cutoff energy and the blackbody temperature \nof model (a) to their respective phase-averaged value.\nAs already mentioned in Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs}, model (b) returns two statistically \nequivalent solutions: one where the partial covering component is statistically significant,\nand the other where the same component is not necessary.\nIn such cases, we adopted the solution in which the partial covering component \nwas not required, unless it was significant at a $99\\%$ c.l.\nThe results are given in Table~\\ref{tab:prs_standard}.\nAll phase-resolved spectra return good fits for each of the two tested models.\nHowever, the cutoff power-law model with blackbody shows a marked modulation of the \nspectral photon index $\\Gamma$ along the orbital phase.\nThe trend of this modulation is similar to that observed for the double-peaked sample \n(see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs}).\nFor a deeper investigation of these results, $\\chi^2$-contour plots of $\\Gamma$ and $N_{\\rm H}$ \nwere produced (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursaverage}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{Figures/standard_contours_cutoff.eps}\n\\caption{$\\chi^2$ contour plots for the {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~standard sample fitted with an absorbed cutoff power-law model \n\tincluding a blackbody component (see Table~\\ref{tab:prs_standard}).\n\tSymbols are the same as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursdouble}.\n\tThe respective orbital phase bins are indicated.}\n\\label{fig:contoursaverage}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe partial covering model shows only marginal variation of the photon index $\\Gamma$,\nwhile the column density clearly changes along the orbital phase,\nand the covering fraction is consistent with a constant value.\nA plot of the standard sample phase-resolved spectra fit with the partial covering \nmodel is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:standard_sim_shifted}.\n\\input{Tables/prs_standard.tex}\n\n\\label{sec:analysis:prs}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe main observational results of our work can be summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item About $15\\%$ of the orbital light curves in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~shows a double-peaked orbital profile, \n      with a dip around the inferior conjunction, both in the $4-10\\,$keV and $10-20\\,$keV energy bands;\n\n\\item orbital phase-resolved spectra of both the double-peaked and the standard sample are well fit by \n      a cutoff power-law model and by a partial covering model;\n\n\\item the cutoff power-law model leads to orbital modulation of both \n\tthe spectral photon index and the column density;\n\n\\item a partial covering model fits the data equally well.\n      No orbital modulation of the spectral photon index is observed in this case.\n      In contrast, orbital modulation of the column density is observed.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn the following we discuss our results within the context of the most recent \nwind accretion scenarios that have been proposed for {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}.\n\n\\subsection{Double-peaked orbital light curve}\\label{subsec:doublelc}\n\nIndications of a double-peaked orbital light curve in Vela~X-1 have already been reported\nby earliest observations of the source with \\textit{Ariel V} \\citep{Eadie+75, Watson+77}.\nBased on \\textit{Tenma} data, \\citet{Nagase89} found an increase of the \ncolumn density along the NS orbit, in particular after the transit phase.\n\\citet{Blondin+91} took both gravitational and radiative effects into account and \nreproduced the observed orbital phase dependence of the column density.\nThey found that an accretion wake that extends toward the observer's line \nof sight at the inferior conjunction produces a local peak in the \ncolumn density absorption along the binary orbit.\n\nIntriguing evidence on the accretion wake in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~was obtained by \\citet{Smith01},\nwho inferred that a hot source around the transit phase of the NS is present by \nanalyzing He\\,$\\lambda1640$ absorption line strengths.\nBased on \\textit{Chandra} X-ray data, \\citet{Watanabe+06} also have inferred the presence \nof a dense cloud obscuring the compact source at the inferior conjunction.\nAll these results are tightly related to the observational features reported in this work.\n\nThe sample of double-peaked orbital profiles, obtained from the very long \n\\textit{MAXI/GSC} monitoring of Vela X-1, shows a remarkable dip at phase Y, \nalso in the $10-20\\,$keV band. \nThis is challenging to explain solely by invoking absorption from neutral matter.\nThe X-ray flux observed at the dip phase is about half of the flux in the \nstandard sample at the same phase (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:profiles}).\nTo halve a luminosity of ${\\sim}4\\times10^{36}\\,$erg/s in the $10-20\\,$keV band, \na column density value of $N_H\\,{\\sim}\\,2\\times10^{24}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ is needed,\n${\\sim}10$ times higher than what is observed in our study.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[angle=270, width=\\hsize]{Figures/nuovo.eps} \n\\caption{Orbital phase-resolved spectra of the double-peaked sample fitted with \n\ta partial covering model, when significant (see text).\n\tThe top panel shows from top to bottom data and folded model of the three spectra \n\tin phase bins X, Y,  and Z.\n\tThe spectra have been multiplied by the factor shown above each curve \n\ton the left side for better visualization.\n\tThe bottom panel shows the residuals for the best-fit model.\n\tSee Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs} for all spectral parameters.\n\t}\n\\label{fig:double_sim_shifted}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn addition, hydrodynamical simulations of stellar winds in HMXBs \n(\\citealt{Blondin+91}, \\citealt{Manousakis+12}) predict a local peak of the \ncolumn density $N_{\\rm H}$ around the inferior conjunction on the order of \n$10^{23}\\,$cm$^{-2}$.\nThis agrees with our observations.\nWe also mention that the {\\emph{INTEGRAL}}~analysis of \\citet{Fuerst+10} highlights a possible \ndip-like feature around the transit in the phase-resolved flux histograms of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~at \n$20-60\\,$keV, that is, at an energy band that is almost unaffected by absorption.\nOur conclusion is therefore that some additional mechanism must be at work \nthat contributes to the flux reduction at the inferior conjunction, \nand that is triggered only in a limited sample of orbital cycles.\n\nA contribution to the observed reduced flux could come from the Compton scattering \nat the low-energy limit, where the cross section is characterized by only a weak dependence \non the photon energy and can be approximated by the Thomson scattering cross section \n($\\sigma_T=6.65\\times10^{-25}\\,$cm$^{2}$).\nTo efficiently scatter X-rays from the accreting pulsar, \nthe surroundings of the compact object need to be ionized and dense enough.\nHydrodynamical 2D and 3D simulations of the stellar wind in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~by \\citet{Mauche+08} showed that \nthe interaction of the wind with the NS leads to strong variations of the wind parameters.\nThese authors found that the accretion wake reaches high temperatures (${\\sim}10^8\\,$K) \nand a high ionization parameter ($\\xi=L_x / (n\\,R_{\\rm ion}^2)\\sim10^4\\,$erg\\,cm\\,s$^{-1}$,\nwhere $n$ is the number density at a given point, while $R_{\\rm ion}$ \nis the distance from this point to the X-ray source).\n\nThe accretion wake extends to scales on the order of the optical companion size \n($R\\sim10^{12}\\,$cm) with a number density of ${\\sim}10^{9-12}\\,$cm$^{-3}$,\nwhich, taking an average value of $n\\sim10^{10}\\,$cm$^{-3}$,\nleads to a column density of ${\\sim}10^{23}\\,$cm$^{-2}$.\nThis is similar to the values obtained from our spectral analysis \nof the double-peaked sample in the Y phase bin \n(see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs_results} and Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}). \nMoreover, the bremsstrahlung cooling time is about $10^{11}\\sqrt{T}/n$~s \n\\citep{Rybicki+Lightman79} that is, ${\\sim}10^5\\,$s, or about one day, \nwhich agrees with the observed time duration of the dip.\nIn other words, the gas stays ionized for a time long enough to allow Thomson scattering.\nThe ionized gas is not traced by the spectral absorption in the soft X-ray band.\nNonetheless, its electron density $n$ is high enough to result in an optical depth value of \n$\\tau=n\\,l\\,\\sigma_T=0.5-0.7$ (where $l=2\\times10^{12}\\,$cm is the length of the accretion wake).\nThus, when the ionized stream of the accretion wake passes through the observer's direction, \nthat is, during the transit, a substantial part of the X-ray radiation can be efficiently \nscattered out of our line of sight.\nThis scenario is further supported by the normalization of the power-law component,\nwhich appears to be modulated along the orbit (see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}),\nindicating an intrinsically dimmer flux at the inferior conjunction\n(although large parameter uncertainties need to be considered).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[angle=270, width=\\hsize]{Figures/standard_sim_shifted2.eps}\n\\caption{\n\tOrbital phase-resolved spectra of the standard sample fit \n\twith a partial covering model, when significant (see text).\n\tThe top panel shows from top to bottom data and folded model \n\tof the spectra in phase bins from $\\phi_1$ to $\\phi_7$.\n\tThe bottom panel shows the residuals for the best-fit model.\n\tSymbols are the same as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:double_sim_shifted}.\n\tSee Table~\\ref{tab:prs_standard} for all spectral parameters.\n\t}\n\\label{fig:standard_sim_shifted}\n\\end{figure}\n\nStellar-wind variability may then be responsible for the modifications of the accretion wake,\nwhich in turn modify the orbital light curve shape, alternating between a double-peaked and a standard morphology.\nWe therefore conclude that the ionized gas in the hot accretion wake,\ncombined with its high column density, is a possible cause for the dip that is observed \nat the inferior conjunction in the double-peaked sample light curves.\n\n\\subsection{Spectral results}\n\n\\subsubsection{Orbital phase-averaged spectroscopy}\\label{subsec:phase_average_results}\n\nOrbital phase-averaged spectra  in the $2-20\\,$keV energy range \nof both the double-peaked and the standard sample were modeled \nwith a cutoff power-law model, adding a blackbody component to account for the soft excess,\nand with partial covering (Table~\\ref{tab:averaged}).\nFor the double-peaked sample, both models return a good fit.\nFor the standard sample the partial covering model is only marginally acceptable, \nwhile the cutoff power-law describes the data well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the inhomogeneous environment in which the NS travels along the binary orbit,\nour phase-averaged results are not straightforward in terms of physical interpretation.\nInstead, these results were used to avoid unphysical best-fit solutions \nof the orbital phase-resolved spectra, fixing some of the model parameters \nto their phase-averaged value (see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs_results} \nand Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs_results}).\n\n\\subsubsection{Double-peaked sample phase-resolved spectroscopy}\\label{subsec:double_prs_results}\n\nFitting the phase-resolved spectra of the double-peaked sample\nwith a cutoff power-law results in orbital modulation of the photon index \n(see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}), which has never been observed in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~to the best of our knowledge.\nThe spectrum becomes harder at the inferior conjunction (Y phase bin) \nthan at earlier and later phases (X and Z phase bins, respectively).\nContour plots for $N_{\\rm H}$ and $\\Gamma$ (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:contoursdouble})\nappear clearly distinct from one phase bin to another,\nindicating that the modulation is not due to the intrinsic coupling between the two parameters.\n\n\\citet{Prat+08} reported photon index modulation \nalong the binary orbit of HMXB IGR~J$19140$+$0951$.\nThese authors ascribed the observed orbital modulation to a variable visibility\nof the region that produces the soft excess.\nSince we do not observe any modulation of the blackbody component,\nour study does not support this interpretation.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we did not find any reliable physical interpretation for this phenomenon.\n\nModeling with partial covering does not show an orbital modulation of the photon index.\nThis model results in absorption increase along the orbital phase \n(see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:standard_prs_results} for a more comprehensive discussion of \nthis result) and in a partial covering component with high covering fraction needed \nat the Y phase bin, which is not required at earlier or later phases, however (see Table~\\ref{tab:doubleprs}).\nA possible interpretation of these results is given by the oscillating behavior \nof the accretion wake \\citep{Blondin+90}.\nBecause of the orbit-to-orbit variations of the ambient wind, the tail of the accretion wake \nis expected to oscillate with respect to our line of sight.\nAveraging this behavior over several orbital periods would result in a large covering fraction,\nwhere the wobbling accretion wake simulates an inhomogeneous absorbing environment.\n\nA different interpretation might be that an intrinsically inhomogeneous structure \nis present around the inferior conjunction and partially covers the X-ray source.\nInhomogeneous stellar winds from supergiant stars (so-called clumps) are expected \n\\citep{Runacres+Owocki05} and observed (\\citealt{Goldstein+04}, and references therein), \nand have been suggested as the cause for {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~flaring activity \n(see \\citealt{Kreykenbohm+08} and \\citealt{Martinez+14}).\nThe timescale on which clumps hit the X-ray pulsar is on the order of the wind's dynamic timescale\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{0.5R_{\\rm B}}{v_{\\rm

\\citealt{Ducci+09, Martinez+14}, and references therein).\n\nEven though the inhomogeneous structure characteristic of the accretion wake might be \na possible cause for the observed partial covering

wind scenarios and accretion modalities in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Standard sample phase-resolved spectroscopy}\\label{subsec:standard_prs_results}\n\nModeling phase-resolved spectra of the standard sample with a \ncutoff power-law leads to a hardening of the spectra around the inferior conjunction \nof about $\\Delta\\Gamma{\\sim}0.35$.\n\n\n\n\nAs we pointed out in Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs_results}, \na physical mechanism for such an orbital dependence of the photon index is not known \nand is difficult to explain.\n\nOn the other hand, fitting the spectra with a partial covering model\nshows that the neutral matter column density $N_{\\rm H}$ \nincreases toward later phases, varying from \n${\\sim}10^{22}$ after the egress ($\\phi_1$), to ${\\sim}10^{23}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ before the ingress ($\\phi_7$).\nThis agrees with earlier studies of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~(see, e.g., \\citealt{Nagase89}),\nand a similar phenomenon has been observed in other HMXBs as well, for instance, \nin 4U~$1700$-$37$ \\citep{Haberl+89}.\nBased on the analysis of both optical \\citep{Carlberg78, Kaper+94} and \nX-ray data \\citep{Feldmeier+96}, it has been shown that the accretion wake is not \nadequate to explain the later phase ($\\phi>0.5$) absorption, and that a more extended \nphotoionization wake is necessary.\n\nWhen this model is applied, the spectral photon index modulation \nalong the orbital phase is only marginal.\nBased on the best-fit results, we can adopt here a similar interpretation \nas for the double-peaked sample results, that is, an inhomogeneous ambient medium \nthat produces strong absorption of the X-ray emission and whose absorption efficiency \ndepends on the orbital phase (see Sect.~\\ref{subsec:double_prs_results}).\nThe column density shows a local peak of $N_{\\rm H}^{pc}{\\sim}3\\times10^{23}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ \naround the inferior conjunction, similar to what is observed for the double-peaked sample, \nstrengthening the connection with the accretion wake.\nMoreover, this sample needs the partial covering component also to fit the spectrum of the phase bin $\\phi_2$,\nwhich is located around the NS greatest eastern elongation (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:sketch}).\nRegardless of whether the partial covering is due to a wobbling or an inhomogeneous accretion wake,\nthese results indicate at a wake that affects the observations at earlier phases than the inferior conjunction.\n\nWe therefore conclude that the absorbing (and likely inhomogeneous) material \nthat partially covers the X-ray pulsar might be due to a different \ninfluence of the accretion wake at different orbital phases.\n\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\n\\section{Summary}\nWe have presented the results of a very long {\\emph{MAXI}}~observation of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}},\nwhich allowed us to perform detailed spectral (phase-averaged and phase-resolved, in $2-20\\,$keV) \nand light curve (in $4-20\\,$keV) analysis. \nOur results can be summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item About $15\\%$ of the orbital light curves in {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~shows a double-peaked orbital profile, \n      with a ${\\sim}1.5\\,$day dip around the inferior conjunction in the $4-10\\,$keV and $10-20\\,$keV energy bands.\n\n\\item Explaining the dip around the inferior conjunction by absorption alone requires column density values \n      of about $2\\times10^{24}\\,$cm$^{-2}$, which are not observed in our analysis.\n\n\\item The dip in the double-peaked sample might be produced by considering contribution from Thomson scattering \n      by an ionized accretion wake that is elongated toward the observer during the transit.\n      Intrinsic variability of the stellar wind leads to strong variations of the accretion wake, including its \n      ionization degree, thus to alternating double-peaked and standard profiles.\n\n\\item When fit with a cutoff power-law model, the double-peaked and the standard samples both\n      show spectral hardening around the inferior conjunction (by ${\\sim}0.3$ in terms of the photon index).\n      We did not find any reliable physical interpretation for this phenomenon, \n      which likely indicates that the model is inadequate for {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}.\n\n\\item Orbital photon index modulation is avoided if a partial covering \n      component is used around the inferior conjunction.\n      This component indicates a highly inhomogeneous environment and local column density \n      peak values of ${\\sim}3\\times10^{23}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ around the inferior conjunction \n      (orbital phases around the eclipse were not analyzed).\n\n\\item Our results suggest either a wobbling or an inhomogeneous accretion wake \n      as the source of the partial covering around the inferior conjunction.\n      Gravitational and radiative effects from the X-ray pulsar may be responsible of density inhomogeneities \n      in the ambient wind that successively feed the observed high X-ray variability.\n      Moreover, the absorption properties of the accretion wake seem to take place \n      at earlier phases than the inferior conjunction.\n\n\\item Some of the analyzed orbital phase-bin spectra do not need a partial covering component.\n      Therefore, any spectral analysis of {\\mbox{Vela~X-$1$}}~needs to consider the orbital phase at which the observation has been carried out.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\\balance\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nWe
