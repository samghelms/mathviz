The key point mentioned in Ref. \\cite{uz2005} was\n that in the reaction $\\gamma d \\to pn$  considered within the  relativistic impulse approximation\n the scaling behavior starts at internal momenta between\n nucleons  in the deuteron\n about $q_{pn}\\sim 1$ GeV/c. Considering this value as the true scale of the CCR onset, one can find that\n  in the reaction $dd\\to~^3Hen$ studied on the basis of the one-nucleon exchange mechanism (ONE)  (see Fig. \\ref{fig2})\n  this magnitude of the momentum  $q_{pn}$ can be achieved  at beam energies  $T_d\\sim 1 $ GeV  for $\\theta_{cm}\\approx 90^\\circ$(see Fig. \\ref{fig3}).  There are data on this reaction obtained at SATURNE in 80's\n  \\cite{bizard}  for  energies  $T_d =0.5 -1.2$ GeV although\n   at lower scattering angles $\\theta_{cm} \\le 60^\\circ$.\n   Our analysis of these data \\cite{uz2005}\n   shows (Fig.\\ref{fig1}) that in this reaction the CCR behaviour $\\sim s^{-22}$ of\n   the differential cross section $d\\sigma/dt$\n   takes the place at $\\theta_{cm} = 50^\\circ - 60^\\circ$\n   and  $T_d=0.5-1.25$ GeV  with $\\chi_{n.d.f.}^2= 1.18$  (note that in this reaction $n=6+6+9+3=24$).\n   In  terms of the internal momentum $q_{pn}$ the scaling\n   appears at  $q_{pn} > 0.5$ GeV/c that is twice lower than in the reaction\n  $\\gamma d\\to pn$, where the CCR  behaviour starts at $q_{pn} > 1$ GeV/c. At lower\n  scattering angles $\\theta_{cm} < 30^\\circ$, i.e.\n  lower internal momenta $q_{pn}< 0.5$  GeV/c, the CCR behaviour is absent\n  as it is expected.\n   Up to now, the reaction $dd\\to ~^3Hen$ ($~^3Hp$) is the only pure\n hadronic process which involves\n  the deuteron and $^3He\\, (~^3H)$ nuclei and  found to follow the CCR.\n\n As shown in \\cite{uz2005}, the cross section of\n the reaction $dp\\to dp$ also demonstrates the CCR behaviour\n $\\sim s^{-16}$   at $T_d= 2T_p = 1-5$ GeV and\n $\\theta_{cm}= 120^\\circ-130^\\circ$.\n\n However, the\n $\\chi^2$-value is not good in this case and, perhaps,\n this is caused by different systematics\n\n of the data included into analysis \\cite{uz2005}.\n For other reactions with the lightest nuclei\n as   $pd\\to~^3H \\pi^+$, $pd\\to~^3He \\eta$, $d^3He\\to ~^4He p$, a systematic experimental\n  study at beam energies\n above 1 GeV and large scattering angles was not done.\n\n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n\\resizebox{0.48\\textwidth}{!}{\n \\includegraphics{tdtetcm.eps}\n}\n\\caption{Internal\n momenta $q_{pn}$\n for the one nucleon exchange mechanism of the reaction\n $dd\\to ~^3Hen$ versus the deuteron beam energy $T_d$ for different\n scattering angles $\\theta_{cm}$.}\n\\label{fig3}\n \\end{figure}\n\n\\section {Discussion}\n\\label{sec3}\n From the point of view of constituent quark model, the observed\n $s^{-22}$ behaviour can be considered as a manifestation of the fact\n that all constituent quarks in the initial and final state are\n active in the $dd\\to ~^3Hen$ ($~^3Hp$) reaction.\n\n  On the whole, interpretation of such phenomena involves\n\n the {\\it quark-hadron duality}. So, the most sucessfull description of the\n $\\gamma d\\to pn$ data was achieved within the Quark-Gluon String model\n formulated in terms of Reggeon exchange \\cite{grishina}.\n In Ref. \\cite{uz2005}\n the Reggeon exchange  model of \\cite{grishina}\n with some modifications was also used  to describe\n the $dd\\to ~^3Hen$ and $dp\\to dp$ reactions in the region of the observed  CCR behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n An exciting feature of existing data on CCR  is the following.\n The scaling behaviour $s^{-11}$ of the cross section of the reaction\n $\\gamma d\\to pn$ starts at transversal momenta $p_T>1.1$ GeV/c (and $E_{\\gamma}> 1 $GeV)\n\\cite{rossi},\n whereas in the reaction $pp\\to d\\pi^+$, measured in Ref. \\cite{anderson} at the same $p_T =1.0 -1.4$ GeV/c,\n the expected CCR scaling regime $s^{-12}$ is not observed \\cite{uz2006}. Why the reaction with photon  differs\n considerably from the reaction with the pion at almost the same kinematic condition?\n As far as we know, the answer to this question is absent. An attempt to explain this \n difference will be done below.\n Furthermore, in the reaction\n $dd\\to ~^3Hp$ the $s^{-22}$ behaviour is appeared \\cite{uz2005}\n at lower transversal momenta  $p_T>0.6 $ GeV/c. A  similarly low boundary in\n terms  of the beam energy\n and internal momenta is found  for the scaling onset $\\sim s^{-17}$ in the reaction\n $\\gamma ~^3He\\to pd$ \\cite{pomerantz2}.\n On the other hand, the scaling behaviour $s^{-11}$ of the diproton photodisintegration in the reaction\n $^3He(\\gamma,pp)n$\n starts  at photon energy $E_\\gamma\\sim 2$ GeV  \\cite{pomerantz1}, that\n is twice larger than the scaling onset in the reaction  $\\gamma d\\to pn$.\nThus, search for scaling onset in  reactions with different nuclei is the first \ntask in this study.\n\n\n \n Empirical success of the  CCR  at moderate energies and transferred momenta\n is hardly related to non-perturbative QCD and\n is considered in current literature as a manifestation of near-conformal\n symmetry of ``the  physical QCD'' \\cite{brodsky-teramod}. Indeed, classical Lagrangian of\n QCD has scale (conformal)\n  and chiral invariance in the limit of zero quark\n masses. Both these symmetries are broken by quantum effects. As a result,\n  the effective coupling constant $\\alpha_s$ depends on  transferred momentum squared $Q^2$,  and\n due to spontaneously broken chiral symmetry constituent quarks become  dynamical\n masses. There are some arguments, however,  that at rather low  transferred\n momenta $Q^2<1$\n (GeV/c)$^2$ the  running coupling constant $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ is large \nand approximately independent of\n $Q^2$ \\cite{deur}.\n In this region, in order to get an\n effective restoration of conformal invariance and explain the CCR onset,\n one needs a mechanism,\n which would provide a reduction of constituent quark masses for light flavors.\n    Following the  mechanism of effective restoration of chiral\n symmetry for excited hadrons  proposed by Glozman \\cite{Glozman}, we assume here that\n for central collisions\n in nuclear reactions  rather high excitations (as compared to $\\Lambda_{QCD}\\sim 200-300$ MeV)\n of hadrons/nuclei are possible in intermediate states. Therefore, intermediate\n hadronic system follows  quasi-classical approximation when\n quantum effects are irrelevant to internal dynamics of hadrons. In this\n regime, the dynamical quark masses are reduced \\cite{Glozman} that could lead (at $\\alpha_s(Q^2)\n \\approx const$) to effective restoration of conformal symmetry, and, as a result, to\n the CCR behaviour of  enough hard nuclear reactions. In addition,  partial restoration of\n the chiral symmetry means decreasing the $\\pi NN$  coupling constant \\cite{Glozman}, that  allows\n one to explain absence of the CCR behaviour in the $pp\\to d\\pi^+$ reactions \\cite{uz2006}.\n If chiral symmetry is completely restored in a given excited nucleon it cannot decay \n into  the $\\pi N$ channel. \n On the other hand, this mechanism   suggests that\n in the $pp\\to d\\rho^+$ reaction the CCR occurs, because the $\\rho$- meson is not a Goldstone boson \\cite{Glozman}.\n It is important  to check this  difference between the $pp\\to d\\pi^+$ and  \n$pp\\to d\\rho^+$\n in experiment.  One should note that a similar result would appead due to \n real restoration of conformal symmetry too. Indeed, the nuclear matter density in\n the short-range\n configurations with high internal momenta between nucleons $q\\sim 1$ GeV/c\n probed in these reactions,\n is close to the critical one, $\\varepsilon_c\\sim 1$GeV/fm$^3$,\n that corresponds to the phase transition \\cite{emeliyanov}.\n\n  Therefore, an important task\n is to search for scaling  behaviour\n of different  exclusive reactions with the lightest nuclei\n at large transversal momenta $p_T>0.6$ GeV/c.\n The nearest task is to determine the boundaries of the scaling region\n of the $dd\\to~^3He n$ ($dd\\to~^3H p$) reaction which was studied in \\cite{bizard}\n by completely different  motivation and very poore statistics was obtained\n in that experiment as compared to the $\\gamma d\\to pn$ reaction in the scaling region\n\\cite{SLAC1,SLAC2,beltz,bochna,schulte,mirazita,rossi}.\n Within the ONE mechanism (Fig.\\ref{fig2}), as seen from Fig.\\ref{fig1},\n the CCR behaviour in the reaction\n $dd\\to ~^3He\\,n$ starts at rather small  internal momenta in the deuteron $q\\approx0.5$ GeV/c.\n\n It is important to verify this scale at other kinematical\n conditions, i.e. at higher beam energies and lower angles or at lower energies\n and higher angles.\n\n New data  are necessary\n  to   check  whether the CCR behaviour\n  is valid in the reaction $dd\\to ~^3He\\,n$  at (i)  energies $T_d>1.2$ GeV\n  for $\\theta_{cm}>60^\\circ$\n and (ii)  scattering angles $\\theta_{cm}=60^\\circ -90^\\circ$ at $T_d>0.5\n $GeV, corresponding\n to   relative momenta in the deuteron $q>0.8$ GeV/c (Fig. \\ref{fig3}).\n Basically, one has to know what is the real parameter for the\n scaling regime -- either internal nucleon momentum $q$\\footnote{ Of course,\n this parameter can be  determined only  within a certain mechanism of the reaction.\n The  ONE mechanism is used here as the most natural one.}, or the transversal\n momentum $p_T$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Proposal for JINR Nuclotron}\n\\label{proposal}\n We propose to measure the cross section\n of reaction $dd\\to$ $~^3Hp$ (or $dd\\to~^3He\\,n$)  at  energies 1 -2.5 GeV and\n $\\theta_{cm}\\leq 50^\\circ$  using the\n  BM@N    facility at the JINR Nuclotron.\n \n The proposed measurement will allow one (i) to check\n whether the CCR behaviour\n of the reaction $dd\\to ~^3H\\,p$  is valid at these kinematical conditions\n which correspond to high internal momenta $q \\geq 0.6$ GeV/c, but\n were not accessible at SATURNE \\cite{bizard}\n and (ii) determine the boundaries of this\n behaviour in terms $\\theta_{cm},\\, p_{T}$ or $q_{pn}$.\n\n This measurement was proposed \\cite{loi2008} first  for WASA-at-COSY \\cite{wasa},\n however, not performed.

This behaviour  is observed\n  not only in reactions with  free hadrons, but\n   with the deuteron  and  $^3He$ too both for electromagnetic and  pure hadronic interactions.\n  One may suppose that observed scaling  points out to effective restoration of near-conformal and, probably, chiral symmetry\n  in these processes.\n   A systematical experimental  study of the scaling   behaviour of the reactions with the deuteron,\n  $^3H$, $^3He$,  and $^4He$ nuclei  is   still absent. We consider a possibility to carry out this study \n  in $dd$  collisions  at the JINR Nuclotron.\n\n\n\n\\PACS{{25.10.+s,}{Nuclear reactions involving few-nucleon systems}\n\\and {24.85.+p,}{Quarks, gluons, and QCD in nuclear reactions}\n{25.55.-e,} {2H-induced reactions}\n\n\n\n\n     } \n} \n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{intro}\n\nThe structure of the lightest nuclei at short distances ($r_{NN} < 0.5$~fm)\nor for high relative momenta ($q > 1/r_{NN}\\sim 0.4$~ GeV/c)\nconstitutes fundamental problem in nuclear physics.\n One of the most important\nquestions  is the following:\n at which values of the  Mandelstam variables $s$ and $t$\n (or, more precisely, relative  momenta $q$ of nucleons in\n  nuclei) does   the transition region\n from the meson-baryon to the quark-gluon picture of nuclei set in?\n So,  the main aim of experiments  on deep inelastic nuclear reactions\n at high transferred momenta in  the so-called {\\it cumulative} region\n\n was to search for dense fluctuations of nuclear matter (fluctons).\n Very interesting features  were observed on this way in inclusive spectra\n which can be interpreted as manifestation of ``drops'' of the quark phase\n in nuclei (see for review  Ref. \\cite{Leksin}). However, a quantitative\ntheory of  cumulative effect is not available\nand, therefore, other independent signals for\nthe transition region are necessary.\n\n\n\n A definite  signature for  transition to the valence  quark region  is given\n by the  constituent\n counting rules (CCR) \\cite{mmt,brodskyf}.
