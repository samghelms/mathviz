We work with a subset of 48 templates with\n$0 < \\alpha \\leq 3$, since the rest of the templates are indistinguishable from the template with $\\alpha = 3$ in the IR\nbands used for our SED fits.\n\n$\\alpha$ is closely related to the temperature distribution of the grains. Approximating the \\citet{dale02} SEDs as modified black bodies with a characteristic\ndust temperature $T_{dust}$, \\citet{magnelli14} have calculated a monotonic conversion between $\\alpha$ and $T_{dust}$.\nReaders interested in the dust temperatures of galaxies in this work can consult Figure \\ref{alpha_dist} in which both $\\alpha$\nand $T_{dust}$ are presented.\n\n\n\\subsection{SDSS measurements}\n\nBy design, HerS overlaps with the Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) \nover about 70 deg$^2$.\nThe Stripe 82 was the target of multiple imaging passes in the five SDSS bands. The imaging is considerably deeper than over \nthe regular survey, making the Stripe 82 particularly useful for detailed structural studies of galaxies in the Local Universe. \nThe SDSS spectroscopic survey covers Stripe 82 with high areal sampling completeness \n($> 90$\\%), and the SDSS spectrograph has provided moderate resolution spectra of the central parts of galaxies\nthrough the 3'' diameter of its fibre apertures. \nWe consider galaxies from the SDSS Main Galaxy sample \n\\citep{strauss02}, with $r_{AB} < 17.77$ and confirmed redshifts in the range of $0.04 < z < 0.15$. \nThe redshift interval covers the majority of SDSS spectroscopic targets\nbut is small enough to keep redshift-dependent selection and aperture effects manageable, \nand reduces the need to account for galaxy evolutionary trends which become non-negligible by $z\\sim0.3$. \nA total of 3319 SDSS galaxies that satisfy the main selection criteria lie in the HerS footprint, and we refer to them collectively\nas the working sample. For reference, the comoving volume spanned by our sample is $2\\times10^{7}$ Mpc$^3$, considerably\nlarger than those of modern cosmological hydrodynamic simulations such as Illustris \\citep{vogelsberger14} or EAGLE \\citep{schaye15}.\n\nWe adopt emission line fluxes, aperture corrections, stellar masses and star-formation rates (SFRs) from the\nMPA-JHU SDSS Data Release 7 \\citep[DR7;][]{abazajian09} database\\footnote{http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/} of galaxy measurements. \nWe summarise the methodology for estimating these quantities, but further details may be found on the database webpages and in related\npublications \\citep{kauffmann03a, brinchmann04, salim07}.\n\nLine fluxes were measured from the SDSS spectra after subtraction of a model for the stellar continuum of the galaxy. \nFor those galaxies with line spectra dominated by the emission from H II regions (i.e., H II galaxies), \ncalibrations based on multi-line ionisation models were used to determine the dust extinction-corrected SFR within the fibre.\nIn other galaxies, such as those with weak line fluxes or those influenced by ionisation from AGN or other sources besides young stars, \na different calibration was employed to derive fibre SFRs, based on a relation between the line-based \nspecific star-formation rate (sSFR) and the optical {$D_{n}4000$}\\ index in H II galaxies. We will use the term `{$D_{n}4000$}\\ calibration'\nto refer to this method later in the paper.\n\nThe SDSS photometry beyond the fibre aperture was calculated by subtracting \nsimulated photometry extracted from their spectra. The SFRs of all galaxies beyond the fibre\nwere estimated from this photometry in a uniform fashion, using SED models calibrated against \nUV-optical tracers based on the study of \\citet{salim07}.\nThe total SFRs of a galaxy is the sum of the individual fibre and outer SFRs. \n\n\n\nThe total SFR is usually much higher than the fibre SFR -- the median ratio is $\\approx 5$ with considerable scatter. \nThe total SFRs are mostly influenced by the component outside the fibre, which is estimated using the same methodology for all classes of galaxy.\n\nStellar masses were estimated from the total SDSS five-band photometry using the same SED models used to estimate the SFRs, both\nwithin and outside the fibre aperture. The MPA-JHU database specifically excludes galaxies with clear broad AGN lines; \ntherefore, all AGN in this study are ``narrow-line\" systems, i.e., their nuclear continuum emission is strongly obscured. This ensures\nthat the stellar mass estimates are not significantly contaminated by AGN light. Corrections for the emission line fluxes were applied\nto the fibre photometry before estimating the fibre masses, so the high equivalent width of narrow emission lines from ionised\nregions around powerful AGN do not bias their masses.\n\nSDSS sources were linked to the HerS catalog using a simple closest distance crossmatch with a maximum tolerance of 5''. The\nchoice of this tolerance was based on the distribution of separations between HerS and SDSS sources singly matched\nwith a circular tolerance of 20'', larger than the 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ PSF size. From the working sample, 1349 galaxies \nare matched to a 250 {$\\mu$m}--selected HerS counterpart, with no multiple matches or duplicate matches; a FIR detection rate of 40\\%.\nOf these, 756 galaxies are detected at 350 {$\\mu$m}, and 165 galaxies are also detected at 500 {$\\mu$m}.\n\n\\subsection{WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ photometry}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{mir_fir_color.eps}\n\\caption{ The ratio of the HerS 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ and ALLWISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ flux densities\nplotted against the HerS 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ flux density.

The three SEDs are identified by their\n$\\alpha$ parameter (see text for details). The limits imply that some \nfainter HerS-detected galaxies with IR SEDs dominated by cold dust emission\n(high $\\alpha$) are not detected to the limit of the ALLWISE W4 photometry.\n}\n\\label{mir_fir_color}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer \\citep[WISE,][]{wright10} has mapped the entire sky in four MIR bands at\n3.4 {$\\mu$m}, 4.6 {$\\mu$m}, 12 {$\\mu$m}\\ and 22 {$\\mu$m}. A public catalog is available consisting of\nphotometry from the all-sky survey atlas of all point-like and extended sources detected with a S/N$>5$ \nin at least one of the four WISE bands. The catalog is not uniform, since the depth of the WISE imaging \nvaries considerably across the sky. The astrometry accuracy of the catalog, tied to the 2MASS coordinate system, \nis better than 200 mas. \n\nWe crossmatched the working sample with the ALLWISE all-sky survey catalog available from the IPAC/IRSA service, using a simple\ncone search with a tolerance of 2''. About 96\\% have a counterpart in the WISE survey, consistent\nwith the success rate of other studies \\citep[e.g.,][]{rosario13d}.\nWe rely on the photometry performed by the ALLWISE survey pipeline, details of which may be found \nin the Data Release Supplement (http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/).\nThe pipeline provides several different photometric measurements for sources in all four WISE bands. The primary photometry\nis performed by PSF decomposition of sources, which assumes that pipeline targets are\ncomposed of blends of point sources (the `profile-fitting' or PRO photometry). A maximum-likelihood model \nof the source plane is simultaneously fit in all four bands for contiguous batches of sources, while as many as two PSF \ncomponents are allowed per source. In addition, various flavours of circular and elliptical aperture photometry are also provided by the survey pipeline.\n\nIn this work, we only employ photometry in the longest wavelength W4 band (22 {$\\mu$m}), covering a continuum-dominated part of the thermal\nIR beyond the bands emitted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \\citep{rosario13d}. \nThe FWHM of the WISE PSF in the W4 band is $\\approx 11\\farcs8$. We use the ALLWISE\nprofile-fit $\\chi^2$ at 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ as a way to identify if the image of a source in that band is likely to be extended\n\\citep[see the Data Release Supplement and the discussion in][]{rosario13d}. All the galaxies in our\nworking sample are consistent with being point sources in the W4 band, allowing us to adopt their PRO\nphotometry. 830 galaxies from the HerS-detected working sample ($\\approx 60$\\%) are detected in W4 with SNR$\\geq 2$. This SNR\nthreshold is lower than what one may traditionally adopt for detection, but since we only use WISE photometry for sources\nwith a firm 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ prior detection, we use the lower significance measurements from ALLWISE for our SED fits (Section 2.4). \n\nThe WISE pipeline also provides an estimate of the W4 flux limit for every source based on the\nresults of the PSF decomposition. \nThese limits have typical value of 2.5 mJy (3$\\sigma$), but there is a considerable tail of shallower limits\nas a consequence of confusion in the WISE atlas images.\n\nWhile the flux density limit of the 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ catalog is about an order\nof magnitude deeper than HerS at 250 {$\\mu$m}, the detection rate of our working sample in ALLWISE W4 is\nconsiderably lower than in HerS. The reason for this can be appreciated through Figure \\ref{mir_fir_color}.\nAt the W4 flux limit,\na population of galaxies with $f_{250} < 0.1$ Jy and high $\\alpha$ (cold dust-dominated SEDs) are missed in ALLWISE\nbut detectable in HerS. This effect also presents an important corollary relevant for MIR studies of local galaxies \\citep[e.g.,][]{lee13}:\ngalaxy samples selected purely from the thermal MIR are biased towards warm dust SEDs, while \nselections based on FIR photometry over the Rayleigh-Jeans (R-J) tail of the cold dust emission, \nspan the full range in dust SED shapes. \n\n\\subsection{GALEX FUV photometry}\n\nThe Herschel and WISE datasets sample the thermal IR SEDs and measure the dust-reprocessed UV and optical luminosity\nof the SDSS galaxies in HerS. However, a fraction of the UV output from star-formation does escape unextinguished, which may be recovered\nfrom direct UV photometry. In this work, we use GALEX far-UV (FUV) data from the Medium Imaging Survey (MIS) which covers a substantial part\nof the Stripe82. The SDSS/DR7-GALEX/GR7 cross-matched subcatalog, available from the GALEX CasJobs SQL interface \n(http://galex.stsci.edu/casjobs/), was queried to recover all GALEX sources over the HerS footprint with an SDSS counterpart.\nAssociations were then made to the galaxies in our sample using the unique SDSS ObjIDs. To minimise spurious matches,\nwe applied a somewhat tighter cross-match tolerance of 3\" over that of the public SDSS-GALEX catalog (which matches counterparts out to 5\").  \n \nIn our analysis, we employ photometry from the GALEX FUV channel which covers the 1350--1750 \\AA\\ band, with a peak sensitivity \nat $\\approx 1500$ \\AA. Light at these wavelengths is particularly representatives of the emission from hot stars and this band has been \nsuccessfully used to study unobscured star-formation in local galaxies \\citep[e.g.][]{salim07, hao11}.\n\nThe GALEX coverage over the Stripe82 area is very non-uniform. When comparing detection statistics of SDSS galaxies in \nGALEX and HerS (Section 4), we restrict ourselves to galaxies that lie in regions with GALEX exposures $> 1$ ksec. We\ndetermine these regions using a coverage map generated using the full MIS source catalog in the HerS footprint (also obtained\nfrom GALEX CasJobs), binned in $1' \\times 1'$ boxes over the field. This approach ensures that varying FUV depths do not lead to \ninconsistent conclusions about the relative amount of obscured and unobscured star-formation.\n \nOf the 3066 galaxies of the working sample with adequate GALEX coverage, 1832 (60\\%) are detected in the FUV band. \nK-corrections in the band are expected to be small ($\\lesssim 30$\\% to $z=0.15$ \nfor the typical UV slope of galaxies).  Therefore, we calculate FUV luminosities ({L$_{\\rm FUV}$}) directly using the measured FUV fluxes.\n \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{alpha_dist.eps}\n\\caption{ Distribution of the \\citet{dale02} shape parameter $\\alpha$ \nof the best-fitting SED template to galaxies from the working sample. High values of\n$\\alpha$ correspond to galaxies with colder typical dust temperatures. The median\nvalue of $\\alpha=2.2$ is typical for normal star-forming galaxies \\citep{dale01}.\n}\n\\label{alpha_dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn Table \\ref{photometry_table}, we tabulate the Herschel/SPIRE, GALEX/MIS and WISE W4 photometry for all 3319\ngalaxies in the working sample. A minimum SNR of 3 is applied to all Herschel photometry, and a minimum SNR of 2\nis applied to the WISE photometry. We do not apply a SNR threshold to the GALEX photometry, depending instead on the\ncriteria used in the MIS catalog. However, we do apply a minimum GALEX coverage as discussed above.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\label{photometry_table}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Photometry of galaxies from the SDSS Main Galaxy sample in the Herschel Stripe 82 survey at $0.04<z<0.15$ (Full version available with the online Journal)}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}\n\\hline\nSDSS OBJID & $f_{\\rm FUV}$ & $e_{\\rm FUV}$ & $f_{\\rm 22}$ & $e_{\\rm 22}$ & $f_{\\rm 250}$ & $e_{\\rm 250}$ & $f_{\\rm 350}$ & $e_{\\rm 350}$ & $f_{\\rm 500}$ & $e_{\\rm 500}$  \\\\\n \n &(log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy)  \\\\\n\\hline \n588015509277573268 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n588015507667419322 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n588015507667419317 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731511538876510 & -4.27 & -5.67 & -2.66 & -3.05 & -1.23 & -1.97 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731513148047431 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731512069587131 & -4.83 & -5.92 & -2.15 & -2.76 & -0.71 & -1.98 & -1.06 & -1.99 & -1.48 & -1.97\\\\\n587731512610324707 &  --   &  --   & -1.57 & -2.89 & -0.29 & -1.99 & -0.63 & -1.98 & -1.18 & -1.95\\\\\n587731513142542498 &  --   &  --   & -1.99 & -2.76 & -0.81 & -1.98 & -1.18 & -1.99 &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731512608292991 & -4.62 & -5.63 & -2.25 & -3.03 & -0.68 & -1.97 & -1.04 & -1.98 & -1.46 & -1.94\\\\\n587731512069455963 &  --   &  --   & -2.33 & -3.05 & -0.83 & -1.96 & -1.10 & -1.98 & -1.36 & -1.95\\\\\n587731512069587156 &  --   &  --   & -2.37 & -3.01 & -1.05 & -2.00 & -1.39 & -2.00 &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731513144377525 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731514222510237 & -3.69 & -5.62 & -1.88 & -2.95 & -0.63 & -1.97 & -0.99 & -1.99 & -1.44 & -1.94\\\\\n587731514222248063 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731514222182633 & -3.60 & -5.56 & -1.90 & -3.02 & -0.47 & -1.99 & -0.73 & -1.99 & -1.11 & -1.97\\\\\n\\hline \\hline\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Infrared luminosities}\n\nIn this work, the total infrared luminosity (TIR) of a galaxy is defined as its integrated IR luminosity between 8 and 1000 {$\\mu$m}.\nThere are different standards in the literature for the range of wavelengths over which the TIR luminosity is integrated. \nFor example, the recent review of \\citet{kennicutt12} define the TIR over 3--1100 {$\\mu$m}. We will\ninstead use the older definition from \\citet{kennicutt98}, which is more widespread in the existing literature. \nThe MIR between 3 and 10 {$\\mu$m}\\ can be affected in complex ways by emission from stellar photospheres\nand very hot dust from star-formation and AGN \\citep[e.g.][]{lu03}, and is therefore harder to constrain empirically.\n \nThe difference in the IR luminosity over 3--1100 {$\\mu$m}\\ and 8--1000 {$\\mu$m}\\ for the library of \\cite{dale02} templates used in this work\nranges between 4\\% and 15\\%, and is therefore only a minor part of the TIR. We adopt a fixed difference of 10\\%\\ (0.041 dex) \nto allow a conversion between these two standards when exploring the performance of multi-wavelength SFR calibrations\nin Section 4. This value is the median difference shown by galaxies from our working sample\nwith constrained SED shapes based on the fits discussed below.\n\nThe TIR luminosities ({L$_{\\rm IR}$}) of galaxies are estimated using fits to their thermal IR SEDs, as sampled by the SPIRE bands\nand the WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ band. The SEDs are fit to the library of IR galaxy templates from \\cite{dale02} using the \nthe Levenburg-Markquardt least-squares algorithm as implemented in the IDL routine MPFIT.  \n\nFits to SPIRE photometry alone do not allow any satisfactory discrimination of the full SED shape, \nsince these bands span the R-J tail of dust emission. For the subset of galaxies with detections in both\nthe SPIRE bands and WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ band, the larger baseline in wavelength gives more accurate constraints on\nthe dust SED. For these galaxies, we estimated the uncertainty on {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ as the range in luminosities shown by IR templates \nthat differed from the best-fit template by a reduced $\\bar{\\chi^{2}} < 1$. This systematic term to the {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ uncertainty is generally \nlarger than the pure statistical uncertainty from the IR photometry.\n\nA histogram of best-fit $\\alpha$ for HerS- and ALLWISE-detected subset of the working sample is shown is \nFigure \\ref{alpha_dist}. It peaks sharply at $\\alpha=2.2$ or $T_{dust}=35$K, typical of normal star-forming galaxies \\citep{dale01}. \n\n\nA small fraction of sources have a best-fit $\\alpha=3$, an extreme value. There is very little variation \nin the long-wavelength shape of cold dust-dominated SEDs in the library and photometric\nscatter leads to some sources that are not well constrained in terms of their $\\alpha$ values. However, {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\\nis only weakly dependent on $\\alpha$ in this regime and it remains robust despite the uncertainty in $\\alpha$. \n\nWe have demonstrated in Figure \\ref{mir_fir_color} that galaxies without WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ detections are likely to have cold SED\nshapes with characteristic $\\alpha > 2$. To estimate {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ in this subset, we fit the SPIRE photometry to a fixed template with\n$\\alpha = 2.2$. The systematic uncertainty is calculated as the span in {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ of the best-fit SEDs with $\\alpha$ in the range $2-2.5$, a \nfactor of 0.25 dex.\n\nWe plot our {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ estimates against redshift in Figure \\ref{lir_vs_z}, distinguishing between galaxies detected at WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ (black points)\nand those with only FIR detections (blue points). The {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ are consistent with the range of limiting IR luminosities (grey band) \ncalculated with the 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ flux limit of $30$ mJy and SEDs spanning the width of the $\\alpha$ distribution in Figure \\ref{alpha_dist}.\nWe also plot in the Figure a set of lines which mark the ridge-line value of the Main Sequence at three characteristic stellar masses\nfollowing the parameterisation of \\citet{speagle14}. To $z\\approx 0.8$, HerS can detect normal star-forming galaxies with masses\nlower than $10^{10}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}. Towards $z=0.15$, HerS-detected galaxies are increasingly dominated by starbursts. \nFor this reason that we restrict our working sample to redshifts below 0.15.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{lir_vs_z.eps}\n\\caption{8-1000 {$\\mu$m}\\ luminosities ({L$_{\\rm IR}$}) of HerS-detected galaxies from the working sample ($0.04<z<0.15$).

We follow the method outlined by \\citet{kewley06}; curves in the diagram are used to separate\nH II galaxies, AGN, and `Composite' systems, which have line ratios intermediate to the first two classes. As a minimum requirement for\na classification using the BPT diagram, we require an {H$\\alpha$}\\ measurement with a SNR$>3$, satisfied by 2188 objects in the working sample. \nGalaxies with weaker {H$\\alpha$}\\ are categorized as `Dim'.  If all four lines of the BPT diagram are detected with SNR$>3$ \nin the spectrum of a galaxy ($\\approx$35\\% of the working sample), the classification is made according to the galaxy's line ratios \nwith respect to the curves from \\citet{kewley06}. If any of the lines (other than {H$\\alpha$}) are detected at a lower significance, a limiting\nvalue for the line is adopted, corresponding to $3 \\times \\sigma_{line}$, where $\\sigma_{line}$ is the uncertainty in the line measurement.\nThe limit on a particular line is propagated into a limit on the corresponding line ratios that include that line,\nand a decision tree is used to identify if the limit on the ratio allows an unambiguous classification of the galaxy. For example, if\n{H$\\alpha$}, {H$\\beta$}\\ and {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}\\ are well-detected in a galaxy, but {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ is weak, the $3 \\sigma_{[O III]}$ limit leads to an upper limit on \n{[O III]}/{H$\\beta$}. If this limit lies below the curve separating H II galaxies from composite systems, the galaxy is unambiguously\nclassified as an H II galaxy. If it lies above the curve, its classification is listed as `Uncertain'. A similar set of rules are applied to\nthe other lines or combination of lines. \n\nWe use the term `AGN' exclusively for those systems which show line ratios in their SDSS spectra characteristic of\na hard ionising spectrum. Composite galaxies exhibit lower ionisation levels than AGN only because a majority \ncontain an admixture of SF and AGN line emission within the SDSS fibre aperture. We use the broad term `active galaxies' throughout this work\nto denote the combined population of AGN and Composites, which include all systems with detectable SMBH accretion. \nThose without clear signatures of high ionisation emission, H II, Dim and Uncertain galaxies, \nare lumped together under the category of `inactive galaxies', though some may host obscured, diluted, \nor faint nuclear activity that is missed by emission line tracers \\citep[e.g.,][]{trump15}.\n\nThe narrow-line active galaxies in our working sample do not include many luminous systems. \nIn the assumption that the extinction-corrected {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ luminosity only arises from ionisation by\nan accreting SMBH, the bolometric luminosities of the active nuclei are estimated, using a relationship from \n\\citet{trump15}, to be between \n$10^{41}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}\\ to $10^{43}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}, with a median value of $4\\times10^{42}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}.\nAt these luminosities, the MIR emission from hot dust in a putative torus would not even be detectable in the WISE\n22 micron band for more than 90\\% of our active galaxies \\footnote{This is estimated using the {L$_{\\rm [O~III]}$}\\--$L_{\\rm MIR}$\nrelationship from \\citet{rosario13d} and the mean AGN SED from \\citet{mor12}.}. \nWe can safely ignore any complications arising from AGN-heated dust in our SED fits.\n\nThere is some debate over whether the emission lines in low-ionisation AGN, so-called LINERs, may be primarily excited by\nsources unrelated to black hole accretion, such as shocks \\citep{heckman80} or hot stars \\citep{terlevich85, singh13}.\nWe acknowledge that the AGN class may encompass a variety of physical processes. In the next paper in this series, which\nexplores the relationships between star-formation and SMBH accretion, we examine the star-forming properties of LINERs in more\ndetail.\n\nTable 1 summarises the division of the SDSS working sample into the five classes\nconsidered in this work: Dim galaxies, H II galaxies, Uncertain classifications, composite galaxies and AGN. The sample\nis split into two redshift bins to minimise redshift-dependent effects and those due to large-scale clustering (Section 3.1). \n\nIn Figure \\ref{bpt_byclass}, we show a pair of BPT diagrams to illustrate the classification method, its results and some properties\nof the various populations. Unambiguous H II galaxies, Composites and AGN are shown in the left panel and \nUncertain galaxies only on the right. Galaxies with a limit on one or both line ratios are indicated by red arrows with directions that show\nthe nature of the limit. About 61\\% of AGN and 32\\% of H II galaxies have a limit in one or more BPT line ratio, but can be classified\nunambiguously. A requirement of high S/N detections on all four lines in the BPT diagram, frequently adopted in SDSS\npopulation studies, will miss substantial numbers of weak AGN and high metallicity H II galaxies, which we can recover by\na simple method of folding in limits on the line ratios.\n\nAbout 15\\% of galaxies are classified as Uncertain. Of these, 63\\% are undetected in both \nthe {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ and/or {H$\\beta$}\\ lines, preventing any constraints along the ordinate of the BPT diagram. \nTheir distribution in the {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}/{H$\\alpha$}\\ line ratio is represented by the inverted histograms in the right panel of Figure \\ref{bpt_byclass},\nwhere the grey histogram shows the measured line ratio for galaxies with detected [N II] and the red histogram shows the\ndistribution of upper limits on the line ratio for galaxies with SNR$<3$ in [N II]. Most galaxies with such weak\n{[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ and {H$\\beta$}\\ lines have high {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}/{H$\\alpha$}, implying high metallicities or levels of ionisation.\nThe rest of the Uncertain class consists mainly of galaxies with limits in [O III] or {H$\\beta$}\\ which place them in the Composite\nregion of the BPT diagram. Taken together, Uncertain galaxies are mostly emission line-weak galaxies with a\nmix of star-formation and other ionisation sources contributing to their line spectra, and include many metal-rich galaxies\nwith strong dust extinction, which preferentially extinguishes the bluer emission lines. When exploring the FIR properties\nof galaxies in the remainder of this paper, we treat Uncertain galaxies as a separate heterogeneous population\nand examine their properties in the context of the other four classes.\n\nIn our classification scheme, Dim galaxies are defined as those with a lack of detectable Balmer line emission. \nHowever, a small fraction (10\\%) of Dim galaxies have {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ or {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}\\ measured with SNR$>3$. This implies\nthe presence of a faint, high ionization emission line region in these systems. \nWhile we still include them in the Dim category, we consider their special nature in\nthe discussion of FIR detection rates in Section 3.1.\n\n\\section{Sample Properties}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{z_dist.eps}\n\\caption{Stellar mass plotted against redshift for galaxies from the working sample (upper panel).\nThe characteristic mass of galaxies increases dramatically towards higher redshifts\ndue to the magnitude cut of the SDSS Main Galaxy sample. The redshift distribution is\nshown in the lower panel. Pronounced spikes are seen from large-scale structure\nin the HerS field, particularly at $z<0.1$.}\n\\label{z_dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Redshifts and stellar mass distributions}\n\nIn the lower panel of Figure \\ref{z_dist}, we plot the redshift distribution of the SDSS sample. \nNear-field large-scale structure over the HerS/Stripe82 field can be discerned, in particular the two sharp spikes\nat $z\\approx 0.045$ and $z\\approx 0.08$. Beyond $z=0.1$\nthe distribution is smoother as the volume occupied by the field gets exponentially larger. The effects of the near-field substructure on\nthe trends we study in this work through environmental covariances could be important. Therefore, as in Table 1 and when necessary, \nwe check our results by splitting the working sample into two fiducial redshift bins: $0.04<z<0.1$ and $0.1<z<0.15$.\n\nThe principal selection bias present in the sample relates to stellar mass ({M$_{\\star}$}). It is evident from the upper panel of Figure \\ref{z_dist}\nthat the range of {M$_{\\star}$}\\ spanned by galaxies in the working sample changes considerably over the redshift range of study due to the\nmagnitude cut of the SDSS Main Galaxy sample.\nConsequently, the characteristic {M$_{\\star}$}\\ of the sample increases by an order of magnitude from $z=0.04$ to $z=0.15$. {M$_{\\star}$}\\\nis widely regarded as one of the prime determinants of galaxy properties, and the strong change in its distribution with redshift\nhas to be taken into account when understanding trends from SDSS-selected galaxy populations.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{stripe82_class_breakup.eps}\n\\caption{{\\bf Upper panel:} The break up of SDSS galaxies in the working sample ($0.04<z<0.15$)\ninto five classes (see Section 2.4) in bins of stellar mass.

Composite\ngalaxies, AGN and galaxies with uncertain classifications have intermediate\nmasses.\n{\\bf Lower panel:} Similar to the upper panel, but only for the subset of \nSDSS galaxies detected at 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ in HerS.

H II galaxies tend to be of low to moderate masses, while Dim galaxies are among\nthe most massive systems in the sample. AGN peak at {M$_{\\star}$}$\\approx 10^{10.9}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ and composite systems are\nfound at slightly lower masses ({M$_{\\star}$}$\\approx 10^{10.7}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}). Uncertain galaxies have a similar\nmass distribution as active galaxies; in terms of gross galaxy properties, they are a closer population\nto Composites and AGN than the general subset of H II galaxies.\n\nFurther insight is available in the fractions of different classes of galaxies across redshift (Figure \\ref{z_dist_byclass}).\nIn the full working sample (the left panel of the Figure), \nthe predominant populations by number are H II galaxies and Dim galaxies, each accounting for 30-40\\%\nof the total.\nThough the majority at $z<0.08$, the fraction of H II galaxies falls with redshift, while Dim galaxies and Uncertain galaxies increase. The\nlatter class becomes as common as H II galaxies at $z\\sim0.13$. This apparent evolution is likely due to a combination \nof the emission line detection limit of the SDSS spectra and the redshift-dependent mass incompleteness of the Main Galaxy sample. \nTowards higher redshifts, an increasing fraction of galaxies have one or more undetected BPT lines, leading to an Uncertain classification,\nwhile more of the low mass H II systems are also excluded. In addition to the smooth decrease with redshift, \nthe H II galaxy fraction shows a local peak at $z\\approx0.05$, likely due to the environmental effects of large-scale structure\ninhomogeneity.\n\nAGN and Composites remain a fairly constant fraction of the population at several percent each across the redshift range. This is because\nactive galaxies exhibit high {M$_{\\star}$}\\ and do not suffer from strong mass incompleteness at any redshift considered here.\n\n\n\\subsection{250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection rates}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying a HerS detection criterion to the working sample results in a very different mix of galaxy types.\nIn the lower panel of Figure \\ref{main_breakup}, the break-up of the HerS-detected subset is shown as a function of stellar mass\nand the fractions of each class across redshift are plotted in the right panel of Figure \\ref{z_dist_byclass}.\nThe most drastic consequence of applying a 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection is the removal of almost\nall of the Dim galaxies. These drop from 34\\% of the full working sample to only 3\\% of the HerS detected subset.\nEven though ionised gas accounts for only a small fraction of the gas mass in galaxies, its presence is closely related\nto the radiation field that heats interstellar dust.\nInterestingly, of the few HerS-detected Dim galaxies, as many as half are also significantly detected in either {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}\\ or {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}, \nbolstering a link between the gaseous content of ionised emission line regions and heated dust. It is unclear whether the dust emission\nreflects low levels of residual star-formation or is heated by an interstellar radiation field arising from hot evolved stars.\nThere is evidence from the SDSS that quiescent galaxies on the Red Sequence with LINER emission have\nyounger stellar populations \\citep{graves07}. Low levels of intermittent star-formation could be associated with the small gas reservoirs\nvisible in some Dim galaxies through these emission line regions.\n\nH II galaxies increase from 37\\% of the full sample to 62\\% of the HerS subset. \nComposites roughly double, while AGN and Uncertain galaxies remain mostly unchanged in their incidence.\nThe fraction of H II galaxies also falls with redshift, though, due to the predominance of this class, the drop is not as\npronounced as for the full working sample. \n\nThe very low HerS detection rates of the Dim galaxies and the complementary high occurrence of star-forming galaxies\ndemonstrates that, at the sensitivity of the HerS survey, most of the FIR emission in inactive (or very weakly active)\ngalaxies is produced by on-going star-formation. \n\n\\begin{table} \n\\centering\n\\caption{250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection Fractions of AGN and Inactive Galaxies (in percent)}\n\\begin{tabular}{r@{ }llc}\n\\hline\nAGN & & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Mass weighted control} \\\\\n\\hline \\hline\nPure AGN: & $36^{+3}_{-4}$ & H II galaxies & $88$ \\\\\n& & Uncertain galaxies & $45$ \\\\\n& & Dim galaxies & $4$ \\\\\n& & All inactive & $35$  \\\\\n\\hline\nComposite: & $69^{+2}_{-3}$  & H II galaxies & $86$ \\\\\n& & Uncertain galaxies & $41$ \\\\\n& & Dim galaxies & $3$ \\\\\n& & All inactive & $40$  \\\\\n\\hline\nAll active: & $54^{+2}_{-4}$ & H II galaxies & $87$ \\\\\n& & Uncertain galaxies & $42$ \\\\\n& & Dim galaxies & $3$ \\\\\n& & All inactive & $38$  \\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe lack of change in the pure AGN detection fraction between the full and FIR detected samples indicates that nuclear\nactivity occurs both in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The {M$_{\\star}$}\\ distribution of AGN, \npeaks between those of H II galaxies and Dim galaxies, suggesting that their hosts are drawn from both these disparate populations.\nIt is well established that the SFR and the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the local Universe is a strong \nfunction of stellar mass \\citep{baldry06,salim07}. Therefore, for a better assessment\nof the relative number of star-forming and quiescent galaxies that contribute to the AGN population, we compare the 250\n{$\\mu$m}\\ detection fractions of AGN to the detection fractions of inactive galaxies after weighting the mass distribution of\nthe inactive galaxies to match those of the AGN. \n\nWe only consider galaxies in the stellar mass range of $10^{9.5}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ to $10^{11.5}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ over which AGN are found \nin our working sample.

As part of its legacy, Herschel targeted large areas of the sky for extragalactic\nscience. This capability was thanks in part to the sensitivity and large field-of-view of the SPIRE imaging instrument \\citep{griffin10}, which \nquickly approached the confusion limit in its range of operating wavelengths ($250 - 500$ {$\\mu$m}) even with sky-scan rates as high\nas 60\" sec$^{-1}$. \n\nWhile much of the effort from Herschel extragalactic surveys have concentrated on galaxy populations in the distant Universe \\citep{lutz14},\nwide-area mapping programs are also suited to studies of more nearby galaxies. For example, the largest Herschel survey of the\nextragalactic sky is the Herschel-ATLAS \\citep{eales10}. With its total area of 550 deg$^{2}$, it spans a co-moving volume of 0.35 Gpc$^3$\nout to $z=0.2$, approximately that of the largest dark matter simulations currently available, such as the Millennium simulation \\citep{springel05}.  \nAs we will demonstrate, confusion-limited photometry of SPIRE images can detect the far-infrared (FIR) dust emission in the\nmajority of local massive star-forming galaxies from such surveys. In addition, the SPIRE PSF (FWHM $> 18$\") is \nbroad enough to allow the treatment of all but the very nearest galaxies as point sources, easing the process of photometric characterisation. \nBut it is also narrow enough to prevent significant blending of galaxies even in compact groups. \nTherefore Herschel wide-area photometric catalogs combined with local galaxy\nsurveys, such as the SDSS Main Galaxy sample, offer an ideal dataset to explore the star-formation and dust properties of \nnormal galaxies over cosmologically interesting volumes. \n\nThe FIR also has unique value as a reliable tracer of the star-formation rate (SFR) in active galaxies, in which the emission\nfrom active galactic nuclei (AGN) can otherwise significantly contaminate or overpower optical, UV or emission line tracers.\nThe long-wavelength FIR ($>100$ {$\\mu$m}) has been demonstrated to arise primarily from dust that is unaffected by the intense\nradiation from the nucleus, even in galaxies that host luminous AGN \\citep{netzer07, mullaney11a, rosario12}. Studies of star-formation\nin active galaxies from the SDSS generally rely on the {$D_{n}4000$}\\ calibration of the SFR or others that involve spectral indices (Section 2.2). \nThese can be critically appraised and, if needed, replaced by direct calorimetric tracers such as the FIR luminosity.\n\nDespite these motivations, only few studies in the existing literature have looked at the Herschel view of the local Universe beyond the very nearest, \nresolved systems which have been targeted individually in large programs such as HRS \\citep{boselli10} and KINGFISH \\citep{kennicutt11}. \n\\citet{lam13} studied the relationships between total infrared (TIR) and {H$\\alpha$}\\ luminosities for $\\approx 290$ emission line galaxies from the SDSS \nin the 14 deg$^2$ science demonstration release of the Herschel-ATLAS. These two tracers\nwere well correlated, though the tightness of the correlation grew increasingly worse towards longer FIR wavelengths. \nAt high emission line luminosities, active galaxies deviated from the typical correlations due to the component of AGN-ionised gas.\n\nWith another modest sample of SDSS galaxies in smaller area deep extragalactic fields ($\\approx 2.2$ deg$^2$), \\citet{dominguez-sanchez14} \nused multi-wavelength tracers, including Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 {$\\mu$m}\\ photometry, to systematically compare\nthe performance of various star-formation indicators, finding broad consistency between them. They also examined the location\nof Herschel-detected galaxies on the plane of star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ({M$_{\\star}$}), confirming that these galaxies\nlie on the so-called Main Sequence of star-formation, a ridgeline feature \nin this plane which defines the location of most star-forming galaxies \\cite[e.g.][]{noeske07,elbaz07,salim07,speagle14}.\n\nWhile breaking new ground, these studies are limited by their small sample sizes, which especially limits conclusive results\nfor rare populations, such as active galaxies. In addition, a full contextual study of FIR flux-limited samples also requires a treatment\nof the galaxies that are not detected in the FIR.\n\nIn this work, we study the properties of $\\approx 3300$ galaxies from the SDSS that lie within \nthe Herschel Stripe 82 survey, including a full characterisation of the \nsubset of about 1300 galaxies that are detected in the FIR. We examine their redshift distributions, classifications, TIR luminosities and \ndetection rates, and compare optical- and infrared-based SFR calibrations, including the important limitations set by the large systematic uncertainties\non SFRs from spectral index and SED-fitting techniques. This study is the first part of a two paper series on the star-forming properties\nof narrow-line selected AGN in the SDSS and serves to introduce our dataset and key measurements that will be used in the second\npaper. \n  \nWe adopt a standard $\\Lambda$-CDM Concordance cosmology, with $H_{0} = 70$ {km s$^{-1}$}~Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.7$. \nStellar masses reported in this study are estimated with a \\citet{chabrier03} IMF. Luminosities are quoted in {erg s$^{-1}$}\\ and SFRs in\n{M$_{\\odot}$}/yr, unless otherwise stated.\n\n\\section{Datasets and Methods}\n\nIn this section, we describe the datasets and methods used for the analyses in the rest of this work.\nWe draw on the extensive set of measurements (redshifts, stellar masses, line fluxes, etc.~) available from the SDSS/MPA-JHU\ndatabase to define and classify our sample of galaxies for study, and to understand their range of observed properties.\nWhere possible, we employ Herschel and WISE photometry to constrain the TIR using SED fits,\nand GALEX FUV photometry to correct for stellar emission not absorbed by dust. These data are brought\nto bear on the cross-assessment of infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV) and optical SFRs in later sections.\n\n\\subsection{The Herschel Stripe 82 survey}\n\nThe Herschel Stripe82 survey \\citep[HerS;][]{viero14} consists of 250, 350 and 500 {$\\mu$m}\\ Herschel/SPIRE maps over a total area of 79 deg$^2$\nin the RA range of 13$^{\\circ}$ to 37$^{\\circ}$ and a Declination range of -2$^{\\circ}$ to 2$^{\\circ}$.\nThe field was covered using two sets of incompletely overlapping, nearly orthogonal scans, leading to some variation in depth. \nThe large SPIRE PSF (FWHM of 18.2'', 25.2'', 36.3'' at 250, 350 and 500 {$\\mu$m}\\ respectively) ensures that almost \nall galaxies are point sources in HerS. The maps are deep enough to approach the confusion limit at 250 {$\\mu$m}, and \nconfusion noise is a substantial factor in the source detection limit of the survey.\n\nWe make use of the public survey catalog available from the HerS website \\footnote{http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/HerS\\_Home.html}.\nA detailed treatment of the source detection and characterisation is available in \\citep{viero14}, and we summarise main aspects here.\nThe catalog is 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ selected to a $3\\sigma$ depth of 28-31 mJy, depending on the local coverage of the map. \nSource detection was performed using the STARFINDER package\n\\citep{diolaiti00} on a high-pass filtered version of the 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ map, designed to remove extended Galactic emission while \nnot strongly influencing the PSF of point sources. Nearby extended sources were also removed from this catalog. The DESPHOT method\nof \\citet{roseboom10} optimised for SPIRE was used for photometry of the detected sources in all bands. This technique\ndeals with deblending of SPIRE sources effectively and uses 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ sources as priors for photometry from the lower resolution\n350 and 500 {$\\mu$m}\\ bands. As a figure-of-merit, the approximate 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ depth of $30$ mJy is sufficient to detect a galaxy at $z=0.08$ \nwith a SFR of $1$ {M$_{\\odot}$}/yr, making it a valuable tool to study obscured and dusty star-formation in the local Universe.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Infrared SED templates}\n\nGalaxies vary in the relative amounts of warm and cold dust \\citep[e.g.,][]{dale01,dale02,ciesla14}, which affects the\nMIR-to-FIR luminosity in their infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs). \\citet{dale02} present a family of IR\nSED templates that encapsulate much of this variation among galaxies in the local Universe. The library\nof templates is parameterised by $\\alpha$, the power-law index of the radiation intensity ($U$) incident on the dust grains.\nFrom \\citet{dale01}, $\\alpha$ is given by:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{d} M(U)  \\; = \\; U^{-\\alpha} \\; \\mathrm{d}U\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathrm{d}M(U)\\;=\\;U^{-\\alpha}\\;\\mathrm{d}U\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>U</mi><mo rspace=\"5.3pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.3pt\">=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><msup><mi>U</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>U</mi></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03039.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\noindent where $N_{g}$ is the total number of inactive galaxies in the mass range,\n$n_{g,i}$ is the number of inactive galaxies detected at 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ in the small bin in stellar mass $i$, and\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 49523, "prevtext": "\n\n\\noindent where $M(U)$ is the mass of dust heated by radiation of intensity U.

Approximating the \\citet{dale02} SEDs as modified black bodies with a characteristic\ndust temperature $T_{dust}$, \\citet{magnelli14} have calculated a monotonic conversion between $\\alpha$ and $T_{dust}$.\nReaders interested in the dust temperatures of galaxies in this work can consult Figure \\ref{alpha_dist} in which both $\\alpha$\nand $T_{dust}$ are presented.\n\n\n\\subsection{SDSS measurements}\n\nBy design, HerS overlaps with the Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) \nover about 70 deg$^2$.\nThe Stripe 82 was the target of multiple imaging passes in the five SDSS bands. The imaging is considerably deeper than over \nthe regular survey, making the Stripe 82 particularly useful for detailed structural studies of galaxies in the Local Universe. \nThe SDSS spectroscopic survey covers Stripe 82 with high areal sampling completeness \n($> 90$\\%), and the SDSS spectrograph has provided moderate resolution spectra of the central parts of galaxies\nthrough the 3'' diameter of its fibre apertures. \nWe consider galaxies from the SDSS Main Galaxy sample \n\\citep{strauss02}, with $r_{AB} < 17.77$ and confirmed redshifts in the range of $0.04 < z < 0.15$. \nThe redshift interval covers the majority of SDSS spectroscopic targets\nbut is small enough to keep redshift-dependent selection and aperture effects manageable, \nand reduces the need to account for galaxy evolutionary trends which become non-negligible by $z\\sim0.3$. \nA total of 3319 SDSS galaxies that satisfy the main selection criteria lie in the HerS footprint, and we refer to them collectively\nas the working sample. For reference, the comoving volume spanned by our sample is $2\\times10^{7}$ Mpc$^3$, considerably\nlarger than those of modern cosmological hydrodynamic simulations such as Illustris \\citep{vogelsberger14} or EAGLE \\citep{schaye15}.\n\nWe adopt emission line fluxes, aperture corrections, stellar masses and star-formation rates (SFRs) from the\nMPA-JHU SDSS Data Release 7 \\citep[DR7;][]{abazajian09} database\\footnote{http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/} of galaxy measurements. \nWe summarise the methodology for estimating these quantities, but further details may be found on the database webpages and in related\npublications \\citep{kauffmann03a, brinchmann04, salim07}.\n\nLine fluxes were measured from the SDSS spectra after subtraction of a model for the stellar continuum of the galaxy. \nFor those galaxies with line spectra dominated by the emission from H II regions (i.e., H II galaxies), \ncalibrations based on multi-line ionisation models were used to determine the dust extinction-corrected SFR within the fibre.\nIn other galaxies, such as those with weak line fluxes or those influenced by ionisation from AGN or other sources besides young stars, \na different calibration was employed to derive fibre SFRs, based on a relation between the line-based \nspecific star-formation rate (sSFR) and the optical {$D_{n}4000$}\\ index in H II galaxies. We will use the term `{$D_{n}4000$}\\ calibration'\nto refer to this method later in the paper.\n\nThe SDSS photometry beyond the fibre aperture was calculated by subtracting \nsimulated photometry extracted from their spectra. The SFRs of all galaxies beyond the fibre\nwere estimated from this photometry in a uniform fashion, using SED models calibrated against \nUV-optical tracers based on the study of \\citet{salim07}.\nThe total SFRs of a galaxy is the sum of the individual fibre and outer SFRs. \n\n\n\nThe total SFR is usually much higher than the fibre SFR -- the median ratio is $\\approx 5$ with considerable scatter. \nThe total SFRs are mostly influenced by the component outside the fibre, which is estimated using the same methodology for all classes of galaxy.\n\nStellar masses were estimated from the total SDSS five-band photometry using the same SED models used to estimate the SFRs, both\nwithin and outside the fibre aperture. The MPA-JHU database specifically excludes galaxies with clear broad AGN lines; \ntherefore, all AGN in this study are ``narrow-line\" systems, i.e., their nuclear continuum emission is strongly obscured. This ensures\nthat the stellar mass estimates are not significantly contaminated by AGN light. Corrections for the emission line fluxes were applied\nto the fibre photometry before estimating the fibre masses, so the high equivalent width of narrow emission lines from ionised\nregions around powerful AGN do not bias their masses.\n\nSDSS sources were linked to the HerS catalog using a simple closest distance crossmatch with a maximum tolerance of 5''. The\nchoice of this tolerance was based on the distribution of separations between HerS and SDSS sources singly matched\nwith a circular tolerance of 20'', larger than the 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ PSF size. From the working sample, 1349 galaxies \nare matched to a 250 {$\\mu$m}--selected HerS counterpart, with no multiple matches or duplicate matches; a FIR detection rate of 40\\%.\nOf these, 756 galaxies are detected at 350 {$\\mu$m}, and 165 galaxies are also detected at 500 {$\\mu$m}.\n\n\\subsection{WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ photometry}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{mir_fir_color.eps}\n\\caption{ The ratio of the HerS 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ and ALLWISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ flux densities\nplotted against the HerS 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ flux density.

The three SEDs are identified by their\n$\\alpha$ parameter (see text for details). The limits imply that some \nfainter HerS-detected galaxies with IR SEDs dominated by cold dust emission\n(high $\\alpha$) are not detected to the limit of the ALLWISE W4 photometry.\n}\n\\label{mir_fir_color}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer \\citep[WISE,][]{wright10} has mapped the entire sky in four MIR bands at\n3.4 {$\\mu$m}, 4.6 {$\\mu$m}, 12 {$\\mu$m}\\ and 22 {$\\mu$m}. A public catalog is available consisting of\nphotometry from the all-sky survey atlas of all point-like and extended sources detected with a S/N$>5$ \nin at least one of the four WISE bands. The catalog is not uniform, since the depth of the WISE imaging \nvaries considerably across the sky. The astrometry accuracy of the catalog, tied to the 2MASS coordinate system, \nis better than 200 mas. \n\nWe crossmatched the working sample with the ALLWISE all-sky survey catalog available from the IPAC/IRSA service, using a simple\ncone search with a tolerance of 2''. About 96\\% have a counterpart in the WISE survey, consistent\nwith the success rate of other studies \\citep[e.g.,][]{rosario13d}.\nWe rely on the photometry performed by the ALLWISE survey pipeline, details of which may be found \nin the Data Release Supplement (http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/).\nThe pipeline provides several different photometric measurements for sources in all four WISE bands. The primary photometry\nis performed by PSF decomposition of sources, which assumes that pipeline targets are\ncomposed of blends of point sources (the `profile-fitting' or PRO photometry). A maximum-likelihood model \nof the source plane is simultaneously fit in all four bands for contiguous batches of sources, while as many as two PSF \ncomponents are allowed per source. In addition, various flavours of circular and elliptical aperture photometry are also provided by the survey pipeline.\n\nIn this work, we only employ photometry in the longest wavelength W4 band (22 {$\\mu$m}), covering a continuum-dominated part of the thermal\nIR beyond the bands emitted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \\citep{rosario13d}. \nThe FWHM of the WISE PSF in the W4 band is $\\approx 11\\farcs8$. We use the ALLWISE\nprofile-fit $\\chi^2$ at 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ as a way to identify if the image of a source in that band is likely to be extended\n\\citep[see the Data Release Supplement and the discussion in][]{rosario13d}. All the galaxies in our\nworking sample are consistent with being point sources in the W4 band, allowing us to adopt their PRO\nphotometry. 830 galaxies from the HerS-detected working sample ($\\approx 60$\\%) are detected in W4 with SNR$\\geq 2$. This SNR\nthreshold is lower than what one may traditionally adopt for detection, but since we only use WISE photometry for sources\nwith a firm 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ prior detection, we use the lower significance measurements from ALLWISE for our SED fits (Section 2.4). \n\nThe WISE pipeline also provides an estimate of the W4 flux limit for every source based on the\nresults of the PSF decomposition. \nThese limits have typical value of 2.5 mJy (3$\\sigma$), but there is a considerable tail of shallower limits\nas a consequence of confusion in the WISE atlas images.\n\nWhile the flux density limit of the 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ catalog is about an order\nof magnitude deeper than HerS at 250 {$\\mu$m}, the detection rate of our working sample in ALLWISE W4 is\nconsiderably lower than in HerS. The reason for this can be appreciated through Figure \\ref{mir_fir_color}.\nAt the W4 flux limit,\na population of galaxies with $f_{250} < 0.1$ Jy and high $\\alpha$ (cold dust-dominated SEDs) are missed in ALLWISE\nbut detectable in HerS. This effect also presents an important corollary relevant for MIR studies of local galaxies \\citep[e.g.,][]{lee13}:\ngalaxy samples selected purely from the thermal MIR are biased towards warm dust SEDs, while \nselections based on FIR photometry over the Rayleigh-Jeans (R-J) tail of the cold dust emission, \nspan the full range in dust SED shapes. \n\n\\subsection{GALEX FUV photometry}\n\nThe Herschel and WISE datasets sample the thermal IR SEDs and measure the dust-reprocessed UV and optical luminosity\nof the SDSS galaxies in HerS. However, a fraction of the UV output from star-formation does escape unextinguished, which may be recovered\nfrom direct UV photometry. In this work, we use GALEX far-UV (FUV) data from the Medium Imaging Survey (MIS) which covers a substantial part\nof the Stripe82. The SDSS/DR7-GALEX/GR7 cross-matched subcatalog, available from the GALEX CasJobs SQL interface \n(http://galex.stsci.edu/casjobs/), was queried to recover all GALEX sources over the HerS footprint with an SDSS counterpart.\nAssociations were then made to the galaxies in our sample using the unique SDSS ObjIDs. To minimise spurious matches,\nwe applied a somewhat tighter cross-match tolerance of 3\" over that of the public SDSS-GALEX catalog (which matches counterparts out to 5\").  \n \nIn our analysis, we employ photometry from the GALEX FUV channel which covers the 1350--1750 \\AA\\ band, with a peak sensitivity \nat $\\approx 1500$ \\AA. Light at these wavelengths is particularly representatives of the emission from hot stars and this band has been \nsuccessfully used to study unobscured star-formation in local galaxies \\citep[e.g.][]{salim07, hao11}.\n\nThe GALEX coverage over the Stripe82 area is very non-uniform. When comparing detection statistics of SDSS galaxies in \nGALEX and HerS (Section 4), we restrict ourselves to galaxies that lie in regions with GALEX exposures $> 1$ ksec. We\ndetermine these regions using a coverage map generated using the full MIS source catalog in the HerS footprint (also obtained\nfrom GALEX CasJobs), binned in $1' \\times 1'$ boxes over the field. This approach ensures that varying FUV depths do not lead to \ninconsistent conclusions about the relative amount of obscured and unobscured star-formation.\n \nOf the 3066 galaxies of the working sample with adequate GALEX coverage, 1832 (60\\%) are detected in the FUV band. \nK-corrections in the band are expected to be small ($\\lesssim 30$\\% to $z=0.15$ \nfor the typical UV slope of galaxies).  Therefore, we calculate FUV luminosities ({L$_{\\rm FUV}$}) directly using the measured FUV fluxes.\n \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{alpha_dist.eps}\n\\caption{ Distribution of the \\citet{dale02} shape parameter $\\alpha$ \nof the best-fitting SED template to galaxies from the working sample.

A minimum SNR of 3 is applied to all Herschel photometry, and a minimum SNR of 2\nis applied to the WISE photometry. We do not apply a SNR threshold to the GALEX photometry, depending instead on the\ncriteria used in the MIS catalog. However, we do apply a minimum GALEX coverage as discussed above.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\label{photometry_table}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Photometry of galaxies from the SDSS Main Galaxy sample in the Herschel Stripe 82 survey at $0.04<z<0.15$ (Full version available with the online Journal)}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}\n\\hline\nSDSS OBJID & $f_{\\rm FUV}$ & $e_{\\rm FUV}$ & $f_{\\rm 22}$ & $e_{\\rm 22}$ & $f_{\\rm 250}$ & $e_{\\rm 250}$ & $f_{\\rm 350}$ & $e_{\\rm 350}$ & $f_{\\rm 500}$ & $e_{\\rm 500}$  \\\\\n \n &(log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy) & (log Jy)  \\\\\n\\hline \n588015509277573268 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n588015507667419322 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n588015507667419317 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731511538876510 & -4.27 & -5.67 & -2.66 & -3.05 & -1.23 & -1.97 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731513148047431 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731512069587131 & -4.83 & -5.92 & -2.15 & -2.76 & -0.71 & -1.98 & -1.06 & -1.99 & -1.48 & -1.97\\\\\n587731512610324707 &  --   &  --   & -1.57 & -2.89 & -0.29 & -1.99 & -0.63 & -1.98 & -1.18 & -1.95\\\\\n587731513142542498 &  --   &  --   & -1.99 & -2.76 & -0.81 & -1.98 & -1.18 & -1.99 &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731512608292991 & -4.62 & -5.63 & -2.25 & -3.03 & -0.68 & -1.97 & -1.04 & -1.98 & -1.46 & -1.94\\\\\n587731512069455963 &  --   &  --   & -2.33 & -3.05 & -0.83 & -1.96 & -1.10 & -1.98 & -1.36 & -1.95\\\\\n587731512069587156 &  --   &  --   & -2.37 & -3.01 & -1.05 & -2.00 & -1.39 & -2.00 &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731513144377525 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731514222510237 & -3.69 & -5.62 & -1.88 & -2.95 & -0.63 & -1.97 & -0.99 & -1.99 & -1.44 & -1.94\\\\\n587731514222248063 &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731514222182633 & -3.60 & -5.56 & -1.90 & -3.02 & -0.47 & -1.99 & -0.73 & -1.99 & -1.11 & -1.97\\\\\n\\hline \\hline\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Infrared luminosities}\n\nIn this work, the total infrared luminosity (TIR) of a galaxy is defined as its integrated IR luminosity between 8 and 1000 {$\\mu$m}.\nThere are different standards in the literature for the range of wavelengths over which the TIR luminosity is integrated. \nFor example, the recent review of \\citet{kennicutt12} define the TIR over 3--1100 {$\\mu$m}. We will\ninstead use the older definition from \\citet{kennicutt98}, which is more widespread in the existing literature. \nThe MIR between 3 and 10 {$\\mu$m}\\ can be affected in complex ways by emission from stellar photospheres\nand very hot dust from star-formation and AGN \\citep[e.g.][]{lu03}, and is therefore harder to constrain empirically.\n \nThe difference in the IR luminosity over 3--1100 {$\\mu$m}\\ and 8--1000 {$\\mu$m}\\ for the library of \\cite{dale02} templates used in this work\nranges between 4\\% and 15\\%, and is therefore only a minor part of the TIR. We adopt a fixed difference of 10\\%\\ (0.041 dex) \nto allow a conversion between these two standards when exploring the performance of multi-wavelength SFR calibrations\nin Section 4. This value is the median difference shown by galaxies from our working sample\nwith constrained SED shapes based on the fits discussed below.\n\nThe TIR luminosities ({L$_{\\rm IR}$}) of galaxies are estimated using fits to their thermal IR SEDs, as sampled by the SPIRE bands\nand the WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ band. The SEDs are fit to the library of IR galaxy templates from \\cite{dale02} using the \nthe Levenburg-Markquardt least-squares algorithm as implemented in the IDL routine MPFIT.  \n\nFits to SPIRE photometry alone do not allow any satisfactory discrimination of the full SED shape, \nsince these bands span the R-J tail of dust emission. For the subset of galaxies with detections in both\nthe SPIRE bands and WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ band, the larger baseline in wavelength gives more accurate constraints on\nthe dust SED. For these galaxies, we estimated the uncertainty on {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ as the range in luminosities shown by IR templates \nthat differed from the best-fit template by a reduced $\\bar{\\chi^{2}} < 1$. This systematic term to the {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ uncertainty is generally \nlarger than the pure statistical uncertainty from the IR photometry.\n\nA histogram of best-fit $\\alpha$ for HerS- and ALLWISE-detected subset of the working sample is shown is \nFigure \\ref{alpha_dist}. It peaks sharply at $\\alpha=2.2$ or $T_{dust}=35$K, typical of normal star-forming galaxies \\citep{dale01}. \n\n\nA small fraction of sources have a best-fit $\\alpha=3$, an extreme value. There is very little variation \nin the long-wavelength shape of cold dust-dominated SEDs in the library and photometric\nscatter leads to some sources that are not well constrained in terms of their $\\alpha$ values. However, {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\\nis only weakly dependent on $\\alpha$ in this regime and it remains robust despite the uncertainty in $\\alpha$. \n\nWe have demonstrated in Figure \\ref{mir_fir_color} that galaxies without WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ detections are likely to have cold SED\nshapes with characteristic $\\alpha > 2$. To estimate {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ in this subset, we fit the SPIRE photometry to a fixed template with\n$\\alpha = 2.2$. The systematic uncertainty is calculated as the span in {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ of the best-fit SEDs with $\\alpha$ in the range $2-2.5$, a \nfactor of 0.25 dex.\n\nWe plot our {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ estimates against redshift in Figure \\ref{lir_vs_z}, distinguishing between galaxies detected at WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ (black points)\nand those with only FIR detections (blue points). The {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ are consistent with the range of limiting IR luminosities (grey band) \ncalculated with the 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ flux limit of $30$ mJy and SEDs spanning the width of the $\\alpha$ distribution in Figure \\ref{alpha_dist}.\nWe also plot in the Figure a set of lines which mark the ridge-line value of the Main Sequence at three characteristic stellar masses\nfollowing the parameterisation of \\citet{speagle14}. To $z\\approx 0.8$, HerS can detect normal star-forming galaxies with masses\nlower than $10^{10}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}. Towards $z=0.15$, HerS-detected galaxies are increasingly dominated by starbursts. \nFor this reason that we restrict our working sample to redshifts below 0.15.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{lir_vs_z.eps}\n\\caption{8-1000 {$\\mu$m}\\ luminosities ({L$_{\\rm IR}$}) of HerS-detected galaxies from the working sample ($0.04<z<0.15$).

We follow the method outlined by \\citet{kewley06}; curves in the diagram are used to separate\nH II galaxies, AGN, and `Composite' systems, which have line ratios intermediate to the first two classes. As a minimum requirement for\na classification using the BPT diagram, we require an {H$\\alpha$}\\ measurement with a SNR$>3$, satisfied by 2188 objects in the working sample. \nGalaxies with weaker {H$\\alpha$}\\ are categorized as `Dim'.  If all four lines of the BPT diagram are detected with SNR$>3$ \nin the spectrum of a galaxy ($\\approx$35\\% of the working sample), the classification is made according to the galaxy's line ratios \nwith respect to the curves from \\citet{kewley06}. If any of the lines (other than {H$\\alpha$}) are detected at a lower significance, a limiting\nvalue for the line is adopted, corresponding to $3 \\times \\sigma_{line}$, where $\\sigma_{line}$ is the uncertainty in the line measurement.\nThe limit on a particular line is propagated into a limit on the corresponding line ratios that include that line,\nand a decision tree is used to identify if the limit on the ratio allows an unambiguous classification of the galaxy. For example, if\n{H$\\alpha$}, {H$\\beta$}\\ and {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}\\ are well-detected in a galaxy, but {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ is weak, the $3 \\sigma_{[O III]}$ limit leads to an upper limit on \n{[O III]}/{H$\\beta$}. If this limit lies below the curve separating H II galaxies from composite systems, the galaxy is unambiguously\nclassified as an H II galaxy. If it lies above the curve, its classification is listed as `Uncertain'. A similar set of rules are applied to\nthe other lines or combination of lines. \n\nWe use the term `AGN' exclusively for those systems which show line ratios in their SDSS spectra characteristic of\na hard ionising spectrum. Composite galaxies exhibit lower ionisation levels than AGN only because a majority \ncontain an admixture of SF and AGN line emission within the SDSS fibre aperture. We use the broad term `active galaxies' throughout this work\nto denote the combined population of AGN and Composites, which include all systems with detectable SMBH accretion. \nThose without clear signatures of high ionisation emission, H II, Dim and Uncertain galaxies, \nare lumped together under the category of `inactive galaxies', though some may host obscured, diluted, \nor faint nuclear activity that is missed by emission line tracers \\citep[e.g.,][]{trump15}.\n\nThe narrow-line active galaxies in our working sample do not include many luminous systems. \nIn the assumption that the extinction-corrected {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ luminosity only arises from ionisation by\nan accreting SMBH, the bolometric luminosities of the active nuclei are estimated, using a relationship from \n\\citet{trump15}, to be between \n$10^{41}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}\\ to $10^{43}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}, with a median value of $4\\times10^{42}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}.\nAt these luminosities, the MIR emission from hot dust in a putative torus would not even be detectable in the WISE\n22 micron band for more than 90\\% of our active galaxies \\footnote{This is estimated using the {L$_{\\rm [O~III]}$}\\--$L_{\\rm MIR}$\nrelationship from \\citet{rosario13d} and the mean AGN SED from \\citet{mor12}.}. \nWe can safely ignore any complications arising from AGN-heated dust in our SED fits.\n\nThere is some debate over whether the emission lines in low-ionisation AGN, so-called LINERs, may be primarily excited by\nsources unrelated to black hole accretion, such as shocks \\citep{heckman80} or hot stars \\citep{terlevich85, singh13}.\nWe acknowledge that the AGN class may encompass a variety of physical processes. In the next paper in this series, which\nexplores the relationships between star-formation and SMBH accretion, we examine the star-forming properties of LINERs in more\ndetail.\n\nTable 1 summarises the division of the SDSS working sample into the five classes\nconsidered in this work: Dim galaxies, H II galaxies, Uncertain classifications, composite galaxies and AGN. The sample\nis split into two redshift bins to minimise redshift-dependent effects and those due to large-scale clustering (Section 3.1). \n\nIn Figure \\ref{bpt_byclass}, we show a pair of BPT diagrams to illustrate the classification method, its results and some properties\nof the various populations. Unambiguous H II galaxies, Composites and AGN are shown in the left panel and \nUncertain galaxies only on the right. Galaxies with a limit on one or both line ratios are indicated by red arrows with directions that show\nthe nature of the limit. About 61\\% of AGN and 32\\% of H II galaxies have a limit in one or more BPT line ratio, but can be classified\nunambiguously. A requirement of high S/N detections on all four lines in the BPT diagram, frequently adopted in SDSS\npopulation studies, will miss substantial numbers of weak AGN and high metallicity H II galaxies, which we can recover by\na simple method of folding in limits on the line ratios.\n\nAbout 15\\% of galaxies are classified as Uncertain. Of these, 63\\% are undetected in both \nthe {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ and/or {H$\\beta$}\\ lines, preventing any constraints along the ordinate of the BPT diagram. \nTheir distribution in the {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}/{H$\\alpha$}\\ line ratio is represented by the inverted histograms in the right panel of Figure \\ref{bpt_byclass},\nwhere the grey histogram shows the measured line ratio for galaxies with detected [N II] and the red histogram shows the\ndistribution of upper limits on the line ratio for galaxies with SNR$<3$ in [N II]. Most galaxies with such weak\n{[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ and {H$\\beta$}\\ lines have high {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}/{H$\\alpha$}, implying high metallicities or levels of ionisation.\nThe rest of the Uncertain class consists mainly of galaxies with limits in [O III] or {H$\\beta$}\\ which place them in the Composite\nregion of the BPT diagram. Taken together, Uncertain galaxies are mostly emission line-weak galaxies with a\nmix of star-formation and other ionisation sources contributing to their line spectra, and include many metal-rich galaxies\nwith strong dust extinction, which preferentially extinguishes the bluer emission lines. When exploring the FIR properties\nof galaxies in the remainder of this paper, we treat Uncertain galaxies as a separate heterogeneous population\nand examine their properties in the context of the other four classes.\n\nIn our classification scheme, Dim galaxies are defined as those with a lack of detectable Balmer line emission. \nHowever, a small fraction (10\\%) of Dim galaxies have {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ or {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}\\ measured with SNR$>3$. This implies\nthe presence of a faint, high ionization emission line region in these systems. \nWhile we still include them in the Dim category, we consider their special nature in\nthe discussion of FIR detection rates in Section 3.1.\n\n\\section{Sample Properties}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{z_dist.eps}\n\\caption{Stellar mass plotted against redshift for galaxies from the working sample (upper panel).\nThe characteristic mass of galaxies increases dramatically towards higher redshifts\ndue to the magnitude cut of the SDSS Main Galaxy sample.

Beyond $z=0.1$\nthe distribution is smoother as the volume occupied by the field gets exponentially larger. The effects of the near-field substructure on\nthe trends we study in this work through environmental covariances could be important. Therefore, as in Table 1 and when necessary, \nwe check our results by splitting the working sample into two fiducial redshift bins: $0.04<z<0.1$ and $0.1<z<0.15$.\n\nThe principal selection bias present in the sample relates to stellar mass ({M$_{\\star}$}). It is evident from the upper panel of Figure \\ref{z_dist}\nthat the range of {M$_{\\star}$}\\ spanned by galaxies in the working sample changes considerably over the redshift range of study due to the\nmagnitude cut of the SDSS Main Galaxy sample.\nConsequently, the characteristic {M$_{\\star}$}\\ of the sample increases by an order of magnitude from $z=0.04$ to $z=0.15$. {M$_{\\star}$}\\\nis widely regarded as one of the prime determinants of galaxy properties, and the strong change in its distribution with redshift\nhas to be taken into account when understanding trends from SDSS-selected galaxy populations.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{stripe82_class_breakup.eps}\n\\caption{{\\bf Upper panel:} The break up of SDSS galaxies in the working sample ($0.04<z<0.15$)\ninto five classes (see Section 2.4) in bins of stellar mass.

H II galaxies tend to be of low to moderate masses, while Dim galaxies are among\nthe most massive systems in the sample. AGN peak at {M$_{\\star}$}$\\approx 10^{10.9}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ and composite systems are\nfound at slightly lower masses ({M$_{\\star}$}$\\approx 10^{10.7}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}). Uncertain galaxies have a similar\nmass distribution as active galaxies; in terms of gross galaxy properties, they are a closer population\nto Composites and AGN than the general subset of H II galaxies.\n\nFurther insight is available in the fractions of different classes of galaxies across redshift (Figure \\ref{z_dist_byclass}).\nIn the full working sample (the left panel of the Figure), \nthe predominant populations by number are H II galaxies and Dim galaxies, each accounting for 30-40\\%\nof the total.\nThough the majority at $z<0.08$, the fraction of H II galaxies falls with redshift, while Dim galaxies and Uncertain galaxies increase. The\nlatter class becomes as common as H II galaxies at $z\\sim0.13$. This apparent evolution is likely due to a combination \nof the emission line detection limit of the SDSS spectra and the redshift-dependent mass incompleteness of the Main Galaxy sample. \nTowards higher redshifts, an increasing fraction of galaxies have one or more undetected BPT lines, leading to an Uncertain classification,\nwhile more of the low mass H II systems are also excluded. In addition to the smooth decrease with redshift, \nthe H II galaxy fraction shows a local peak at $z\\approx0.05$, likely due to the environmental effects of large-scale structure\ninhomogeneity.\n\nAGN and Composites remain a fairly constant fraction of the population at several percent each across the redshift range. This is because\nactive galaxies exhibit high {M$_{\\star}$}\\ and do not suffer from strong mass incompleteness at any redshift considered here.\n\n\n\\subsection{250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection rates}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying a HerS detection criterion to the working sample results in a very different mix of galaxy types.\nIn the lower panel of Figure \\ref{main_breakup}, the break-up of the HerS-detected subset is shown as a function of stellar mass\nand the fractions of each class across redshift are plotted in the right panel of Figure \\ref{z_dist_byclass}.\nThe most drastic consequence of applying a 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection is the removal of almost\nall of the Dim galaxies. These drop from 34\\% of the full working sample to only 3\\% of the HerS detected subset.\nEven though ionised gas accounts for only a small fraction of the gas mass in galaxies, its presence is closely related\nto the radiation field that heats interstellar dust.\nInterestingly, of the few HerS-detected Dim galaxies, as many as half are also significantly detected in either {[N II]$\\lambda6584$}\\ or {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}, \nbolstering a link between the gaseous content of ionised emission line regions and heated dust. It is unclear whether the dust emission\nreflects low levels of residual star-formation or is heated by an interstellar radiation field arising from hot evolved stars.\nThere is evidence from the SDSS that quiescent galaxies on the Red Sequence with LINER emission have\nyounger stellar populations \\citep{graves07}. Low levels of intermittent star-formation could be associated with the small gas reservoirs\nvisible in some Dim galaxies through these emission line regions.\n\nH II galaxies increase from 37\\% of the full sample to 62\\% of the HerS subset. \nComposites roughly double, while AGN and Uncertain galaxies remain mostly unchanged in their incidence.\nThe fraction of H II galaxies also falls with redshift, though, due to the predominance of this class, the drop is not as\npronounced as for the full working sample. \n\nThe very low HerS detection rates of the Dim galaxies and the complementary high occurrence of star-forming galaxies\ndemonstrates that, at the sensitivity of the HerS survey, most of the FIR emission in inactive (or very weakly active)\ngalaxies is produced by on-going star-formation. \n\n\\begin{table} \n\\centering\n\\caption{250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection Fractions of AGN and Inactive Galaxies (in percent)}\n\\begin{tabular}{r@{ }llc}\n\\hline\nAGN & & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Mass weighted control} \\\\\n\\hline \\hline\nPure AGN: & $36^{+3}_{-4}$ & H II galaxies & $88$ \\\\\n& & Uncertain galaxies & $45$ \\\\\n& & Dim galaxies & $4$ \\\\\n& & All inactive & $35$  \\\\\n\\hline\nComposite: & $69^{+2}_{-3}$  & H II galaxies & $86$ \\\\\n& & Uncertain galaxies & $41$ \\\\\n& & Dim galaxies & $3$ \\\\\n& & All inactive & $40$  \\\\\n\\hline\nAll active: & $54^{+2}_{-4}$ & H II galaxies & $87$ \\\\\n& & Uncertain galaxies & $42$ \\\\\n& & Dim galaxies & $3$ \\\\\n& & All inactive & $38$  \\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe lack of change in the pure AGN detection fraction between the full and FIR detected samples indicates that nuclear\nactivity occurs both in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The {M$_{\\star}$}\\ distribution of AGN, \npeaks between those of H II galaxies and Dim galaxies, suggesting that their hosts are drawn from both these disparate populations.\nIt is well established that the SFR and the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the local Universe is a strong \nfunction of stellar mass \\citep{baldry06,salim07}. Therefore, for a better assessment\nof the relative number of star-forming and quiescent galaxies that contribute to the AGN population, we compare the 250\n{$\\mu$m}\\ detection fractions of AGN to the detection fractions of inactive galaxies after weighting the mass distribution of\nthe inactive galaxies to match those of the AGN. \n\nWe only consider galaxies in the stellar mass range of $10^{9.5}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ to $10^{11.5}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ over which AGN are found \nin our working sample.

We estimate the error on the TIR-based SFRs as a quadrature\nsum of the errors on {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ and an additional constant uncertainty of 0.09 dex \nto account for the larger scatter of pure TIR SFRs with respect to SDSS SFRs among H II galaxies.\n\nIn Table~\\ref{properties_table}, we compile a number of useful properties of all 3319 galaxies in our working sample,\nincluding estimates of {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ and pure TIR SFRs.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\label{properties_table}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Properties of galaxies from the SDSS Main Galaxy sample in the Herschel Stripe 82 survey at $0.04<z<0.15$ (Full version available with the online Journal)}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}\n\\hline\nSDSS OBJID & z & Class & {M$_{\\star}$}\\ & SFR [SDSS]$^{\\rm a}$ & {L$_{\\rm IR}$}$^{\\rm b}$ & $\\alpha$$^{\\rm c}$ & SFR [TIR] \\\\\n  &&&(log {M$_{\\odot}$}) & (log {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ yr$^{-1}$) & (log {erg s$^{-1}$}) & &  (log {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ yr$^{-1}$) \\\\\n\\hline \n588015509277573268 & 0.04494 & Dim        & 10.29 & $-1.89<-1.13<-0.16$ &       -----       &  --   &  --  \\\\\n588015507667419322 & 0.04456 & Dim        &  9.88 & $-2.37<-1.59<-1.06$ &       -----       &  --   &  --  \\\\\n588015507667419317 & 0.04608 & Dim        & 10.17 & $-2.53<-1.71<-1.14$ &       -----       &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731511538876510 & 0.04068 & H II       &  9.23 & $-0.37<-0.20<+0.06$ & $43.06<43.17<43.22$ & 2.38  & -0.40\\\\\n587731513148047431 & 0.04296 & Dim        & 10.22 & $-2.01<-1.23<-0.70$ &       -----       &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731512069587131 & 0.05367 & H II       & 10.74 & $+0.35<+0.52<+0.70$ & $43.83<43.92<43.97$ & 2.38  & 0.35 \\\\\n587731512610324707 & 0.04521 & H II       & 10.77 & $+0.51<+0.70<+0.93$ & $44.28<44.29<44.30$ & 2.19  & 0.72 \\\\\n587731513142542498 & 0.04643 & AGN        & 10.61 & $-0.63<-0.04<+0.45$ & $43.83<43.86<43.86$ & 2.06  & 0.29 \\\\\n587731512608292991 & 0.05613 & H II       & 11.13 & $+0.18<+0.52<+0.87$ & $43.87<43.90<43.93$ & 2.75  & 0.33 \\\\\n587731512069455963 & 0.04473 & AGN        & 10.79 & $-1.40<-0.49<+0.01$ & $43.55<43.60<43.64$ & 2.62  & 0.03 \\\\\n587731512069587156 & 0.07735 & H II       & 10.48 & $-0.00<+0.29<+0.61$ & $43.93<43.98<44.00$ & 2.19  & 0.41 \\\\\n587731513144377525 & 0.08156 & Dim        & 10.65 & $-1.78<-0.94<-0.36$ &       -----       &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731514222510237 & 0.04044 & H II       & 10.05 & $+0.19<+0.40<+0.66$ & $43.86<43.88<43.88$ & 2.12  & 0.31 \\\\\n587731514222248063 & 0.04162 & Dim        &  9.84 & $-2.22<-1.47<-0.97$ &       -----       &  --   &  --  \\\\\n587731514222182633 & 0.04237 & H II       & 10.87 & $-0.20<+0.23<+0.59$ & $43.95<43.97<43.99$ & 2.44  & 0.40 \\\\\n\\hline \\hline\n\\multicolumn{8}{l}{\\textsuperscript{a}\\footnotesize{   16th percentile value $<$ median value $<$ 84th percentile value}}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{8}{l}{\\textsuperscript{b}\\footnotesize{   $1\\sigma$ low $<$ best-fit $<$ $1\\sigma$ high}}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{8}{l}{\\textsuperscript{c}\\footnotesize{   From \\citet{dale02}.

It is important to understand the nature of these\nsystems in the overall framework of multi-wavelength star-formation tracers, since this population\nwill include galaxies with low values of $C_{\\rm FUV}$ which are not represented among the FIR-bright\nsubsample detected in HerS. For example, the distribution of $C_{\\rm FUV}$ among the galaxies of the\nHerschel Reference Survey \\citep[HRS,][]{boselli10} (shaded histogram in Figure \\ref{fuv_correction}) is\nshifted to a lower median value than either our sample or those from \\citet{hao11}. \nThe HRS galaxies are primarily low mass systems in the very local Universe (15--25 Mpc away) and include\na number of dwarf galaxies that are not found in the more distant SDSS/HerS sample. Despite this, the\ndifferences in the $C_{\\rm FUV}$ distributions in Figure \\ref{fuv_correction} certainly indicate that galaxies\nwith high FUV escape fractions do exist and should be found among the FIR-weak subset.\n\nA particularly instructive diagram to help us understand the FIR undetected population is shown in Figure \\ref{fuv_mass},\nin which {L$_{\\rm FUV}$}\\ is plotted against {M$_{\\star}$}\\ separately for H II galaxies and Dim galaxies from the working sample.\nFIR-detected sources are marked with red symbols. \n\nAmong H II galaxies, the fraction with both GALEX and HerS counterparts is high ($\\approx 70$\\%) -- \nthe majority of these galaxies have $C_{\\rm FUV} > 3$. Regardless of their FIR properties, H II galaxies\ndisplay only a weak correlation between {L$_{\\rm FUV}$}\\ and {M$_{\\star}$}\\ with considerable scatter.\n\nA surprisingly large fraction of Dim galaxies have FUV detections ($\\approx 30$\\%), though, in contrast to H II galaxies,\nvery few of these ($\\approx 8$\\%) also have FIR counterparts. Since Dim galaxies comprise\nthe largest subgroup from the working sample, the majority of FUV-detected galaxies that are not\ndetected in HerS are in fact in the Dim category. Unlike the H II galaxy population, the bulk of Dim galaxies (75\\%) show\na fairly narrow linear correlation between {L$_{\\rm FUV}$}\\ and {M$_{\\star}$}, though they are typically an order of magnitude\nless UV luminous. The small number of Dim galaxies that are bright in the FUV lie in the same region of the diagram and \nshow the same trends as H II galaxies. These may be misclassifications due to dust obscuration \nor other effects that affect the visibility of the {H$\\alpha$}\\ line. \n\nThe low FIR detection rate and weakness of the FUV emission in Dim galaxies suggests \nthat the primary FUV-emitting sources in these systems are of a different nature from those in H II galaxies. \nThe best explanation is the well-known `FUV upturn' of early-type galaxies, believed to be produced primarily by \nextreme horizontal-branch stars \\citep[][and references therein]{oconnell99}. In the lower panel of Figure \\ref{fuv_mass},\nwe show with a shaded band the expected location of galaxies in the diagram due to the FUV upturn. This was calculated \nusing the empirical range of $FUV - V$ colours of elliptical galaxies \\citep[$2-4$ mag,]{oconnell99} combined with a fixed $V$-band stellar mass-to-light ratio\nof a 10 Gyr simple stellar population synthesis model from \\citet{han07}. Clearly, the trend seen among most of the \nDim galaxies is entirely consistent with the FUV upturn phenomenon. The evolved stars that drive the upturn are not related to star-formation\nand are not closely associated with ISM dust, which explains the low FIR detection rate of FUV-detected Dim galaxies.\n\nTaking H II galaxies as the representative population of star-forming systems, our analysis of the $C_{\\rm FUV}$ distribution\nleads us to conclude that, in the range of masses and SFRs shown by our sample, more than 2/3 of galaxies have\nlow FUV escape fractions. The IR, by and large, is a more complete tracer of the star-forming luminosity of our galaxies.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fuv_mass.eps}\n\\caption{The FUV luminosity ({L$_{\\rm FUV}$}) plotted against stellar mass ({M$_{\\star}$})\nof inactive galaxies from our working sample.

Empirical uncertainties on IR SFRs\nare smaller and generally more symmetric than the uncertainties on the optical SFRs.\nWhile H II galaxies show a tight 1:1 correspondence between the optical and IR SFRs,\nHerS-detected galaxies of other classes show elevated IR SFRs. \n}\n\\label{lir_comp}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FIR photometry from HerS allows us to probe down to equivalent IR-derived SFRs $\\lessapprox 0.25$ {M$_{\\odot}$}/yr.\nThis sensitivity and the large sample size available from the HerS area is the main advance in this work.\nIn the remaining part of the paper, we will use these SFRs to examine optically-derived SFRs from the SDSS/MPA-JHU, \nespecially among classes such as active galaxies for which \nwell-calibrated emission line indicators of SFR cannot be easily used. \nThe assessment of SFR calibrations sets the stage for our second paper, which concentrates on the star-forming\nproperties of the active galaxies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure \\ref{lir_comp}, we plot the SDSS SFR against TIR-based SFRs (using Equation 6 and a 0.08 dex correction) \nfor galaxies from the working sample. For clarity, galaxies are split by classification, and objects in the two fiducial \nredshift bins are shown with different symbols and colors. \n\nWe also show the typical errors on the SFRs for the different classes of galaxies. The errors on \nthe optical SFRs are directly from the MPA-JHU catalog. \nFor H II galaxies, they reflect the uncertainties on {H$\\alpha$}\\ fluxes, extinction corrections, \nand corrections to SFRs for the parts of galaxies beyond the SDSS fiber aperture. For all other categories of galaxies, the\nerrors combine uncertainties on outer SFRs, following the same systematics as H II galaxies, and the \nuncertainties of the {$D_{n}4000$}-based calibration of SFRs within the fibre.\nSince this calibration has considerable real scatter \\citep{brinchmann04}, the SFR errors for the active, Uncertain, \nand Dim galaxies can be considerably larger than those for H II galaxies, even at the same median SFR. \nThese errors also tend to be asymmetric, with a larger spread to low SFRs, especially among Dim galaxies.\n\nH II galaxies, which account for most of the HerS-detected galaxies (63\\%), are shown\nin the middle panel of the top row of Figure \\ref{lir_comp} (equivalent to the right panel of Figure \\ref{sfr_comps_mw}. \nThe close agreement between the two estimates of the SFR is shared by galaxies in both the fiducial redshift bins.\nError-weighted orthogonal bisector regression tests show that there is a small deviation from a slope of unity, but this\nis driven primarily by Eddington bias about the HerS flux limit (see Section 5.2). The tightness of the correlation\nindicates that most of the TIR luminosity of the H II galaxy population arises in mildly-obscured star-formation\nwhich is also traced by emission lines.\n\nIn contrast to H II galaxies, all the other classes show a different behaviour in Figure \\ref{lir_comp}.\nIn general, the IR-derived SFRs for active galaxies (AGN \\& composites) and Uncertain galaxies are higher\nthan their median optical SFRs. The difference is most pronounced for galaxies with low optical SFRs, \nwhere the offset is $>0.5$ dex. However, even those with higher overall SFRs exhibit\na small net offset of $\\approx 0.1$ dex which is not seen among H II galaxies. Composite galaxies show smaller offsets, \npure AGN and Uncertain galaxies show larger offsets, while the small number of Dim galaxies detected\nat 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ have the most substantial offsets. In addition, all these classes also exhibit a significantly\nwider scatter about a median relationship than H II galaxies, pointing to a weaker correspondence between \noptically-derived and IR-derived SFRs.\n\nThe case for Dim galaxies is particularly interesting, since our analysis of their GALEX properties\nsuggests that a small fraction ($\\sim 25$\\%) may actually be star-forming galaxies, given their large FUV luminosities.\nAmong this subset of Dim galaxies, the 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection fraction (21\\%) is much higher than the typical fraction\nfor the Dim class, which further supports our claim that BPT-based classification in the SDSS misses a non-negligible\npopulation of relatively massive, star-forming galaxies. These misclassified Dim galaxies make up a major\nproportion of the points in the top left panel of Figure \\ref{lir_comp}.\n\nIn the remaining part of this section, we investigate the nature of the offsets seen among some of the HerS-detected SDSS galaxies. \nWe use the symbol {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$} $= \\log (SFR[\\rm TIR] / SFR[\\rm SDSS])$ to refer to these offsets in the following discussion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The origin of the SFR offsets}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{delta-sfr_vs_mstar.eps}\n\\caption{ Logarithmic offsets ({$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}) between the IR and optical SFRs \nfor galaxies of different classes, plotted against stellar mass ({M$_{\\star}$}).\nThe dotted line marks an offset of zero.\n}\n\\label{delta_sfr_mstar}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{delta-sfr_vs_lo3.eps}\n\\caption{  Logarithmic offsets ({$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}) between the IR and optical SFRs\nfor galaxies of different classes, plotted against the extinction-corrected {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ luminosity ({L$_{\\rm [O~III]}$}).\nThe dotted line marks an offset of zero.\n}\n\\label{delta_sfr_lo3}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe offsets between IR-based and optical SFRs could arise because the TIR luminosities of galaxies in \nour working sample have been overestimated, or because their FIR emission contains a contribution from dust that\nis not heated by star-forming regions. Alternatively, their SDSS SFRs could be systematically underestimated. \nConsidering the large uncertainties of the SDSS SFRs for all classes except H II galaxies (Figure \\ref{lir_comp}),\nthe latter explanation seems most reasonable. Nevertheless, we devise some simple tests to check the other alternatives as well. These\ntests look for correlations between {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ and other galaxy properties.\n\nDetailed studies of dust emission in local galaxies have shown that a portion of the long-wavelength FIR luminosity arises in distributed\ncold dust which is heated by the diffuse interstellar radiation field \\citep{lonsdale87,sauvage92,bendo12}.  \nIn quiescent galaxies, the interstellar radiation field may arise mostly from\nthe light of evolved stars which are unrelated to star-formation \\citep[e.g.,][]{groves12}. One may postulate that this `cirrus' component\nof the FIR luminosity could be dominant in massive galaxies, since most of the stellar mass in such systems is locked in old stellar\npopulations. If cirrus emission unrelated to current star-formation is the source of excess {L$_{\\rm IR}$}, \nwe expect that {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ correlates with the total stellar mass of galaxies \\citep{smith12,boselli12}.\n\nWe consider this in the Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_mstar}, where we have plotted the {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ as a function of {M$_{\\star}$}\\ for the HerS-detected\ngalaxies, separating them into three broad categories: H II galaxies, AGN and composites, and the remaining Uncertain and Dim galaxies.\nH II galaxies, which do not typically show large {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}, display no trend over 1.5 dex in {M$_{\\star}$}. The other classes are more massive and \nshow larger offsets. However, there is no significant correlation between {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ and {M$_{\\star}$}\\ for all non-H II galaxies. \nGiven that substantial offsets are found over almost an order of magnitude in {M$_{\\star}$}, \nit is unlikely that the dust-reprocessed light of evolved stars is a leading cause of the excess {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ in massive galaxies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother explanation is the heating of dust by alternate sources of UV and optical continuum, such as from an AGN or shocks.\nThese sources also contribute disproportionately to the emission of high ionisation lines such as {[O III]}, and we may expect, in such a situation,\nto find a trend between the extinction-corrected {[O III]$\\lambda5007$}\\ luminosity of galaxies and {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}. As one may gather from Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_lo3},\nno good correlation is evident between {L$_{\\rm [O~III]}$}\\ and the offset, either among active galaxies or among \nthe few Uncertain and Dim galaxies with detectable {[O III]}. H II galaxies, as expected, scatter uniformly around a zero offset.\n\nBased on the absence of any significant trends, we conclude that excess cirrus emission or \nheating sources beyond star-formation are not responsible for the bulk of the observed offsets in SFR\nthat we find in massive non-H II galaxies detected in HerS. \n\nHaving found no systematic issues with the IR luminosities, we now consider the SDSS SFRs as a possible source of the offsets seen in \nFigure \\ref{lir_comp}. Surprisingly, we find that the strongest dependence of {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ \nis not with any physical property of these galaxies, but with the estimated uncertainty of the\nSDSS SFRs. We demonstrate this in Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_esfr}. The error on the SDSS SFR for a galaxy is taken to be half the logarithmic\ndifference (or the logarithm of the ratio) between the 84th and 16th percentile of the SFR likelihood distribution for that galaxy from the MPA-JHU\ncatalogs. This quantity is equivalent to a 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty for the special case of a normal likelihood distribution. \nBoth active galaxies and inactive non-H II galaxies (Uncertain and Dim) display a strong correlation between {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ and the error on the\nSDSS SFR. This correlation is not evident among H II galaxies, which tend to have smaller SFR uncertainties.  \nAlmost all galaxies with large {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ also have very uncertain optically-derived SFRs. Conversely, galaxies with accurate optical\nSFRs show small {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}, regardless of classification. \n\nThis behaviour can be understood as the consequence of standard Eddington bias. If a galaxy has a very uncertain SFR measurement, \nthe true SFR can differ from the estimated SFR by a considerable amount. If this true SFR is higher than the estimated SFR and \nplaces the galaxy above the HerS detection limit, it will appear in Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_esfr} with a large positive {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}. On the\nother hand, if the true SFR is close to or below the estimated SFR, the galaxy would likely not be detected in the FIR and therefore not\nappear in the Figure. The increasing value of the offset with the SFR error is due to the fact that errors on the SFR are strongly anti-correlated with \nthe magnitude of the optical SFR.\n\nIn the next subsection, we test this explanation by simulating Eddington bias in the SDSS galaxy population taking into account\nthe redshift-dependent detection limits of the SDSS and HerS surveys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{delta-sfr_vs_errsfr.eps}\n\\caption{ Logarithmic offsets ({$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}) between the IR and optical SFRs\nfor galaxies of different classes, plotted against the characteristic uncertainty\nof the SDSS SFRs.

These panels may be compared to\nthe corresponding panels for each class in Figure \\ref{lir_comp}.\n}\n\\label{simulation}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The effects of SFR calibration uncertainties}\n\n\nThe degree and asymmetry of the uncertainties on the optical SFRs, \ncombined with the standard redshift-dependent luminosity and volume biases found in the flux-limited SDSS galaxy population,\ncould potentially cause the large offsets between the observed and expected {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ seen in non-H II HerS-detected galaxies. Objects\nwith the largest asymmetric uncertainties are those with the lowest SFRs. These are only detectable in HerS at lower redshifts. \nWhen combined with Eddington bias about the FIR flux limit this results in a one-sided scatter about the 1:1 line in \nFigure \\ref{lir_comp}. At higher redshifts, Malmquist bias \nrestricts us to the subsample with high SFRs, which exhibit more symmetric uncertainties and scatter.\nTo test this, and to examine the accuracy of the SDSS SFR calibrations, we \nperformed a simple simulation of the effects of SFR calibration uncertainties on the correspondence\nof optical and IR-based SFRs in HerS-detected galaxies. \n\nWe randomly varied the SFR of each galaxy in our working sample with a probability distribution following the \ncalibrated uncertainty of the SFR from the MPA-JHU database, accounting for the asymmetry of the distribution.\nThis resampled SFR, which we denote as {$\\overline{\\textrm{SFR}}$}, may be thought of as a `true' SFR, which \ndiffers from the median SDSS estimate of the SFR because of its systematic\nuncertainty. {$\\overline{\\textrm{SFR}}$}\\ was translated to a TIR luminosity ({$\\bar{\\textrm{L}}_{IR}$}) following Eqn.~6. \nFor each galaxy, a limiting detectable TIR luminosity {L$_{\\rm IR}^{l}$}\\ was also estimated, as the luminosity of a source \nat the redshift of the galaxy with a randomly chosen SED shape following a probability distribution mirroring the measured $\\alpha$ distribution from \nFigure \\ref{alpha_dist} and with a 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ flux at the HerS detection limit of 30 mJy. This takes into account the \nscatter in SED shapes shown by normal star-forming galaxies. If {$\\bar{\\textrm{L}}_{IR}$}$ >${L$_{\\rm IR}^{l}$}, the galaxy was flagged as detected in the simulation; \nif not, it was flagged as undetected. One hundred independent iterations of the simulation were performed.\n\nIf the likelihood distributions of the MPA-JHU SFR estimates are accurate, \nand if the majority of the TIR luminosity in HerS-detected galaxies is related to on-going\nstar-formation, then we should expect the galaxies with detectable {$\\bar{\\textrm{L}}_{IR}$}\\ in the simulation to show the same distribution of {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\\nas HerS-detected galaxies show in Figure \\ref{lir_comp}. Additionally, the 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ detection fraction of galaxies in the simulation \nshould compare favourably with those empirically measured from HerS.\n\nIn the large left panel of Figure \\ref{simulation}, we plot {$\\overline{\\textrm{SFR}}$}\\ against the SDSS median SFRs \nof all non-H II galaxies from a single representative iteration of the simulation. \nSince we are interested here primarily in the effects of SFR calibration uncertainties\nin systems other than H II galaxies, we only show these populations in this Figure.\nWith their accurately calibrated optical SFRs, H II galaxies show, as expected, a close correspondence between \nsimulated and estimated SFRs (see middle panel of Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_simul}, so we exclude them from Figure \\ref{simulation} for the sake\nof clarity. \n\nFrom Figure \\ref{simulation}, it is clear that the simulated detections (black points) are offset from the 1:1 line, \nand that this offset depends on the SFR of the galaxy. \nWhen combined with the non-detections (red points), the overall population shows a more symmetric scatter about the line\nof equality, though a small distinct offset is seen throughout. The larger offsets among the detections at lower SDSS SFR is because of\nthe HerS flux limit, as discussed above. In addition, the spectroscopic flux limit of the SDSS Main Galaxy sample places\na rough lower limit on the SFR of galaxies in the working sample of $\\approx 0.03$ {M$_{\\odot}$}/yr. \nThis limit results in the apparent vertical edge feature in the simulation at that value along the X-axis.\n\nIn the right panels of Figure \\ref{simulation}, we split the population by their spectral classifications and only show the simulated\ndetections. These plots compare favourably with the corresponding panels in Figure \\ref{lir_comp}. Another\nrepresentation of the behaviour of the different classes is shown Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_simul}, in which the simulated {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\\nfrom one of the iterations of the simulation is plotted against the optical SFR uncertainty. This Figure mirrors the \nempirical version from Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_esfr}, except that it also shows those galaxies with simulated {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ \nthat would not be detectable in HerS. With increasing SFR error, galaxies display a larger spread in {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}, producing the\nfan-shaped pattern that scatters about the zero offset line. Galaxies with detectable {$\\bar{\\textrm{L}}_{IR}$}, shown as black solid points, tend\nto have positive {$\\Delta_{\\rm SFR}$}\\ and occupy the upper envelope of the pattern, leading to the apparent trends seen among\nthe actual non-H II galaxy population (Figure \\ref{delta_sfr_esfr}). \n\nBecause of their accurate SFRs, calibrated mostly from emission-line luminosities, H II galaxies only show a mild scatter. \nThere is a small tail of HerS-detected H II galaxies with low SFRs and modest SFR errors, \nand the action of Eddington bias on this subset can explain the mild deviations from the 1:1 line\nseen among the H II galaxy population in Figure \\ref{lir_comp}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{delta-sfr_vs_errsfr_simulated.eps}\n\\caption{The logarithmic difference between the simulated SFR and the median  \nSDSS SFR for galaxies of different classes, plotted against the characteristic uncertainty\nof the SDSS SFRs.

The uncertainties on the simulated fractions are determined from an analysis of all 100 iterations of the simulation. \nThe observed detection fractions of H II and Dim galaxies are reproduced by the simulation to within\na few percentage points. Among active and Uncertain galaxies, the simulated detection fractions are generally a \nbit lower than the observed ones, particularly in the lower redshift bin, suggesting that the uncertainties on the optical SFRs for these\nclasses are underestimated. Alternatively, optical tracers may miss a proportion of heavily obscured\nSF in these types of galaxies. We will address this topic in more detail in a forthcoming paper on the molecular gas content of FIR-detected\nactive galaxies in HerS. The broad consistency between the simulated and observed HerS detection fractions suggests that the SDSS/MPA-JHU\ncalibrations of SFR that are widely used in there literature are accurate within their substantial uncertainties. \n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\n\\subsection{Infrared selection of star-forming galaxies}\n\nWith the depth and areal coverage of the HerS SPIRE photometry, we are able to detect cold dust emission in the FIR\nin $\\approx 40$\\% of galaxies at $0.04<z<0.15$ from the SDSS Main Galaxy sample in the HerS region.\nIn contrast, only about 20\\%\\ are detected in the WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}\\ band ($\\geq 3\\sigma$) \\footnote{For the SED fits, we apply a lower threshold for detection\nin the WISE W4 band. This is suitable for photometric modeling since the primary selection is a significant detection in the SPIRE 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ band. \nIn this discussion, we are concerned with an assessment of selection strategy.}. \nIn addition, 23\\%\\ of galaxies are only detected in the FIR with no significant MIR detection, while only 2\\%\\ are pure MIR sources.\nAs we demonstrate in Section 2.3 and Figure \\ref{mir_fir_color}, there is a population of star-forming galaxies with SEDs dominated\nby cool dust which have relatively weak MIR emission. These galaxies are preferentially lost from WISE MIR-selected samples, but are\nrecovered by Herschel FIR selection. Therefore, MIR-selected studies of star-formation may be systematically biased towards\ngalaxies with warm dust SEDs. FIR-selected samples are more representative of the full population,\nby virtue of selection in a wavelength regime where star-formation heated dust emits most of its radiation.\n\n\\subsection{Towards a complete view of star-forming galaxies}\n\nAn approach frequently adopted in comparative studies of galaxies in the SDSS and other spectroscopic surveys \nis the use of the BPT diagram to differentiate between galaxies which are star-forming from other populations that\nexhibit emission lines, such as active galaxies. However, one or more of the four main BPT emission lines \nmay be too faint to detect due to strong dust extinction, particularly among massive and metal-rich\ngalaxies. Such galaxies have uncertain BPT classifications and are frequently overlooked or neglected in many studies.\nThese Uncertain galaxies account for $\\approx 20$\\%\\ by number and for $\\approx 20$\\%\\ of the integrated SFR of\nmassive galaxies ($> 3\\times10^{10}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}) in the SDSS. About 40\\%\\ are detected in HerS, indicating that they \nharbour enough star-formation to place them on or near the Main Sequence of star-forming\ngalaxies. A full treatment of the star-forming properties of local massive galaxies should take this population into account. The\ncalorimetric nature of the FIR as a measure of the SFR will allow us to finally do so over the substantial areas of sky covered\nby Herschel surveys. In a companion paper, we develop a full context for the frequently-overlooked population of Uncertain galaxies\nand show that they show many parallels to the host galaxies of AGN.\n\n\n\\subsection{The reliability of SFR estimates from the SDSS}\n\nH II galaxies show a close correspondence between optical- and IR-derived SFRs (or multiwavelength SFRs), \nwhich argues that most of the cold dust emission in these systems is heated by SF. All other classes of galaxies, \nif detected in the FIR, exhibit higher TIR luminosities than expected from\nextrapolations based on their SDSS SFRs. In these latter categories, SDSS SFRs are evaluated using the optical {$D_{n}4000$}\\ calibration. \nOur analysis of the uncertainties of their optical SFRs strongly suggests that most of the differences are driven by \nsystematics related to these calibrations, in combination with selection effects inherent to the SDSS and the HerS survey (Section 4.2). \nIn other words, the apparent enhancements in {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ are, for the most part, not due to a dominant contribution from \nobscured SF, AGN-heated dust, or distributed cirrus emission in these galaxies.\n\nThe tightness of the relationship between optical SFRs, largely based on prompt emission line-based tracers,\nand IR SFRs, which trace dust emission, is quite remarkable. Resolved studies of the dust\nemission in galaxies \\citep[e.g.,][]{bendo12} have shown that the long-wavelength FIR is frequently more extended\nthan the short-wavelength emission and does not correlate as well with star-forming regions. This has led\nto the suggestion that a substantial component of the cold dust luminosity is associated with a diffuse\ninterstellar radiation field that could come from evolved stars. Even if the contribution from an old\nstellar population was not dominant, the FIR is not a prompt tracer of star-formation since dust can be heated\nby stars that are older than a few 100 Myrs \\citep{kennicutt09, hao11}. Despite these considerations, the narrowness of the\noptical and IR SFR relationship that, among normal star-forming galaxies, the luminosity of cold dust emission\nis closely tied to the current level of star-formation. We consider a few explanations that may all play a role.\na) The interstellar radiation field in galaxies may be largely produced by light leaking out from star-forming regions, in which\ncase the diffuse cirrus emission will also reflect their average SFR. b) The typical star-formation history of galaxies may\nbe constant for several 100s of Myr. c) The dust emission tracks the mass of dust, which is proportional to the total\nmolecular gas mass in galaxies, and, through the galaxy integrated Kennicutt-Schmitt law, to the total SFR of galaxies \\citep{kennicutt98}.\nThe last explanation would require a fairly fixed gas-to-dust ratio in galaxies to explain our observations, \nwhich is at odds with the typical scatter of $>0.3$ dex found even at a fixed galaxy metallicity \\citep{remy-ruyer14}.\nRegardless of the reason, our study indicates that, among massive galaxies ({M$_{\\star}$}$>10^{10}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}), the \nTIR luminosity is a reliable measure of the SFR and should be preferred to methods based on age-dependent indicators such as {$D_{n}4000$}.\n\nLarge area Herschel surveys, such as HerS, can provide accurate FIR-based SFRs for many thousands of galaxies in the nearby\nUniverse. However, the confusion limit of Herschel maps will prevent direct FIR detections for galaxies fainter than a few 10s of mJy\nat 250 {$\\mu$m}. The Main Sequence at {M$_{\\star}$}$=10^{11}$ {M$_{\\odot}$}\\ is detectable only out to $z\\sim0.15$.\nAcross `local' redshifts, Herschel-detected galaxies become increasingly dominated by the rarer star-bursting systems that \nlie well above the Main Sequence. Therefore, Herschel surveys do not provide a full census of SFR, even among local \nmassive galaxies. At minimum, the known mass incompleteness of the SDSS and the \nredshift-dependent sampling of the Main Sequence must be taken into account for a consistent treatment of SF galaxies\nbased on Herschel samples. As a trivial example,\nin a monolithic sample consisting of all star-forming galaxies from $z=0.01$ to $z=0.2$ with Herschel detections,\nstar-bursts will be heavily over-represented compared to the true galaxy population.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The star-forming properties of active galaxies}\n\nAs a population, active galaxies are detected at a higher rate in HerS than equally massive inactive galaxies (Section 3.3).\nBroadly, nuclear activity is preferentially found in star-forming galaxies, consistent with results for active galaxies selected\nby X-ray selection at higher redshifts \\citep{silverman09, rosario13b}. While the hosts of nuclear activity are drawn from both \nthe star-forming and quiescent populations, as well as quenching systems transitioning between them,\naccretion of cold gas on to SMBHs is also linked to the same reservoir of gas that fuels star-formation \\citep[e.g.][]{kauffmann07,\nrosario13b, vito14}. This is likely the primary link which connects star-formation and nuclear activity, especially among the low\nluminosity active galaxies in our sample. Recently, \\citet{trump15} show that as many as 30\\%\\ of active galaxies \nmay be missed due to dilution of weak AGN lines by H II regions in the SDSS spectroscopic fibre aperture, implying\nthat the co-eval connection between active star-formation and AGN may be even more pronounced that we find in this work.\n\nConsidering the two classes of active galaxies separately, the `pure' \nAGN are detected in HerS at a rate that is identical to the general population of equally massive \ninactive galaxies ($\\approx 35$\\%), while the rate for composites is considerably higher ($\\approx 70$\\%). This is consistent\nwith the common interpretation of composites as galaxies hosting AGN as well as concurrent star-formation. Table 1 shows\nthat the HerS detection rate of composites is substantially lower than equally massive H II galaxies, indicating that composites\nare not simply H II galaxies with additional nuclear activity but probably include a number of galaxies with lower SFRs than \nthe typical H II galaxy population. We examine the relative star-forming properties of H II galaxies, composites and AGN\nin the next paper in this series.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have undertaken a critical comparison of infrared and optical constraints of the SFR of galaxies using a set of $\\approx 3300$\ngalaxies from the SDSS Main Galaxy sample at $0.04<z<0.15$ covered by the Herschel Stripe82 survey. Our conclusions\nare listed below:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item The FIR is a reliable measure of the SFR in normal star-forming galaxies (on the Main Sequence).\nSFRs derived from the infrared compare well with those from emission line tracers such as {H$\\alpha$}. \nThe systematic uncertainties on IR-derived SFRs are significantly lower than those from colour or \nspectral index--based methods, making them particularly valuable for active galaxies or dusty galaxies.\nSurveys that image the sky to the Herschel/SPIRE confusion limit are capable of detecting galaxies \non the massive end of the Main Sequence out to z=0.15.\n\n\\item The selection of star-forming galaxies based only on the long-wavelength MIR WISE bands is\nbiased towards systems with warm dust temperatures, and will miss a population of faint  \ngalaxies dominated by cold dust SEDs. Herschel surveys can recover this population and offers a selection\nmethod that is relatively unbiased to dust temperature variation.\n\n\\item Galaxies with one or more undetected BPT emission lines cannot be classified using the standard \nBPT diagram. These galaxies generally exhibit high masses and modest FIR detection rates. \nTheir properties overlap considerably with those of active galaxies, and the populations may be related. Such Uncertain\ngalaxies are frequently ignored or underrepresented in studies that rely purely on emission-line detected samples on the BPT diagram. \nWe assert that a more complete picture of star-forming and active galaxies in the local Universe requires that these systems be\nfully considered in future studies.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n \n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank the anonymous referee for a rigorous and constructive review which has substantially improved the quality of this work.\nJRT acknowledges support from NASA through Hubble Fellowship grant \\#51330 awarded by the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., for NASA under contract NAS 5-26555.\nSome of the data presented in this paper were obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).

In both cases, the best-fit template from the \\citet{dale02} library is plotted\nas a black line, while the grey lines show the range of templates that determine the uncertainties on {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ (Section  2.5).\nWhen good photometry is available both in the MIR and FIR, the range in possible galaxy templates is small, as seen in the left panel.\nWhen no MIR photometry is available, the Herschel data itself does not adequately constrain the FIR SED shape. \nIn these cases, as shown in the right panel, we adopt a nominal range in galaxy SED shapes to evaluate our uncertainty in {L$_{\\rm IR}$}.\n\nThe accuracy of our {L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ estimates depends critically on the validity of the \\citet{dale02} galaxy template library as a representation\nof the real diversity of IR SEDs of galaxies. We test this assumption using a set of 130 local galaxies from the Herschel\nReference Survey \\citep[HRS;][]{boselli10} with published IR photometry from Spitzer/MIPS \\citep{bendo12} and Herschel/SPIRE\n\\citep{ciesla12}. We fit the MIPS 24 {$\\mu$m}\\ (a close alternative to WISE 22 {$\\mu$m}) and SPIRE 250 {$\\mu$m}\\ photometry of these\ngalaxies using our template-based method. The resulting 3-1000 {$\\mu$m}\\ IR luminosities were then compared to estimates\npublished in \\citet{ciesla15}, in which all available MIPS and Herschel photometry of these galaxies, including coverage at 70 and 160 {$\\mu$m},\nwere fit with detailed dust models from \\citet{draine07}. Figure \\ref{hrs_checks} shows this comparison. While more uncertain, our template-based\nfits recover the total IR luminosity of these galaxies very well. However, we do find small deviations from the 1:1 line at \n{L$_{\\rm IR}$}$> 10^{43.5}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}, at the luminosities that encompass most of our SDSS/HerS sample. Since HRS is a very local survey,\nit does not include many luminous and massive galaxies. Nevertheless, the success of our fitting technique in recovering the\n{L$_{\\rm IR}$}\\ of most of the HRS galaxies suggests that the \\citet{dale02} templates are a suitable way to capture the properties of real\ngalaxy SEDs when only MIR and FIR photometry beyond the dust peak are available.\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 57378, "prevtext": "\n\nA crucial first check is to compare these multi-wavelength SFRs with those derived from the SDSS\nfor the H II galaxy population.
