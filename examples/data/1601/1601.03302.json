SU(2)_R\\rightarrow SU(2)_V}$  of the \n${\\rm SU(2)}$ BSM flavor group of sextet fermions generates an isotriplet of three massless Goldstone \nbosons in the chiral limit. \n\nThe three Goldstones\nwill become longitudinal modes of the ${ W^{\\pm}}$ and $Z^0$ weak gauge bosons via the dynamical \nHiggs mechanism when the Electroweak interactions are turned on. This minimal realization of the composite Higgs\nmechanism comes from the perfect match between the longitudinal Electroweak gauge bosons \nand three massless Goldstone bosons  from sextet strong dynamics as one of the most \nattractive features of this BSM theory.\nIt is near-conformal with just one ${\\rm SU(2)}$  fermion flavor doublet with unexpected spectroscopy,\ndistinct from old Technicolor. We already noted that the\ndynamical Higgs mechanism does not depend on the electric charge assignment of the (u,d) fermion pair\nwith left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets as would be determined \nfrom the choice of hypercharges ${\\rm Y}$\nunder the weak isospin gauge group ${\\rm SU(2)_w}$. Independent of ${\\rm Y}$, \nthe three Goldstone bosons always have the correct \ninteger electric charges ${\\rm (\\pm 1,0)}$ to morph into the longitudinal components of the weak bosons as further\ndetailed in Section 4.\nSince the sextet gauge model is naturally located very close to the lower edge of the conformal window \nwithout fine tuning, a light scalar with a far separated resonance spectrum is expected from strong dynamics,\nmaking the minimal Higgs mechanism of the model economic and attractive.\n\nIn contrast, the condition of near-conformal behavior with fermions  in the fundamental \nrepresentations of ${\\rm SU(3) }$ bsm-color\nrequires a large number of fermion flavors in the BSM construction which leads to an excess of unwanted \nmassless Goldstone bosons. \n\n\n\n\nThe added complexities can be illustrated with the well-known one-family model\nfrom the Technicolor era with global flavor symmetry \n${\\rm SU(8)_L\\!\\otimes\\!SU(8)_R}$  of eight massless chiral fermions carrying bsm-color \nin the fundamental representation of the ${\\rm SU(3)}$ gauge group~\\cite{Farhi:1980xs}.\nIn the new near-conformal BSM paradigm a minimum of eight flavors is needed in the fundamental color\nrepresentation to get closer to the conformal window.  This motivated recent studies of the \neight-flavor fermion model to understand the\nstrong BSM force of the one-family model from several lattice studies~\\cite{Fodor:2009wk,Aoki:2014oha,Fodor:2015baa,Hasenfratz:2014rna,Appelquist:2014zsa,Schaich:2015psa}.\n\nThe  ${\\rm \\chi SB}$ pattern  ${\\rm SU(8)_L\\!\\otimes\\!SU(8)_R\\rightarrow SU(8)_V}$  generates 63 Goldstone bosons \nwith only three needed in the composite Higgs mechanism.\nGenerating masses for the excess unwanted Goldstone bosons  presents \nnon-trivial phenomenological challenges, making it more difficult to achieve the \ndesired goal of a near-conformal spectrum with a light $0^{++}$ scalar \nfar separated from resonance excitations.\n\n\\section{Constraints from global and gauge anomalies}\n\nAssuming that the strongly coupled gauge sector of the sextet model turns out to be compatible \nwith resonances \nin the 2-3 TeV region, a more complete BSM outlook of the model would come into focus,\nguided by anomaly constraints. \nWe will show that the existence of stable baryons in the sextet model when combined with our understanding \nof the early Universe requires anomalous fermion representation in the Electroweak sector. \n\nAlthough the sextet BSM model cannot offer a UV complete solution\nfor fermion mass generation and the related flavor problem, the outlook for new physics \nfrom extending the strongly coupled gauge sector guided by anomaly constraints is necessary. \n\nAnomaly compensating new physics has several important and immediate aspects \nwithout deference to physics on the scale of UV completion. \nIt provides an outlook and framework for new \nphysics the model can predict, or accommodate on several energy scales. \nAnomalies not only can predict or accommodate plausible new\nfermion content at the TeV scale but also give insight into\nElectroweak corrections to Standard Model expectations.\nThe example we will provide below is the anomaly canceling \npair of two massive lepton doublets (and associated right-handed singlets) to cancel the \nanomalies in Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:Banomaly1}) and (\\ref{eq:Banomaly2}) from left-handed sextet fermion\ndoublets. New charged lepton \nand neutrino masses are partially constrained parameters in this anomaly matching extension.\nEven if the new fermion masses are set to very high energy scales, \ntheir infrared effects from the associated anomaly content will always survive. \nThe best known examples of this footprint from integrating out heavy fermions include\nthe Wess-Zumino effective action and other residual effects on the Electroweak scale~\\cite{D'Hoker:1984ph,D'Hoker:1984pc,Preskill:1990fr,D'Hoker:1992bv}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Anomaly conditions in the sextet model}\n\nAnomaly constraints have a long history in Technicolor motivated BSM model building with \nrepresentative examples \nin~\\cite{Dietrich:2005jn,Kainulainen:2006wq,Foadi:2007ue,Antola:2009wq,Kainulainen:2009rb}.\nThe first condition for model construction with left-handed doublets is the global Witten anomaly \nconstraint which requires an even number of left-handed SU(2) multiplets to \navoid inconsistency in the theory from a vanishing fermion determinant of the partition function~\\cite{Witten:1982fp}.\n\nIn addition, gauge anomaly constraints also have to be satisfied~\\cite{Adler:1969er}. \nWith vector current ${\\rm  V^i_\\mu(x)=\\overline{\\psi}T^i\\gamma_\\mu\\psi(x)}$ and axial current \n ${\\rm A^i_\\mu(x)=\\overline{\\psi}T^i\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5\\psi(x)}$\nconstructed from fermion fields and internal symmetry matrices ${\\rm T^i}$ in some group representation \nR for fermions, the anomaly in the axial vector Ward\nidentity is proportional to ${\\rm tr(\\{T^i(R),T^j(R)\\}T^k(R))}$ and must vanish. \nIn the sextet theory fermions are either left-handed doublets or right-handed singlets \nunder the ${\\rm SU(2)_w}$ gauge group. \nThe matrices ${\\rm T^i}$  will be either the ${\\rm \\tau^i}$ Pauli matrices \nor the diagonal ${\\rm U(1)}$ hypercharge ${\\rm Y}$.\nSince the ${\\rm SU(2)}$  group is  anomaly free, ${\\rm tr(\\{\\tau^i,\\tau^j\\}\\tau^k)=0}$, \nwe only need to consider anomalies where at least one ${\\rm T^i}$ is the hypercharge Y.\nThe non-trivial constraints come from two conditions on hypercharge traces,\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13734, "prevtext": "\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nAn important strongly coupled near-conformal gauge theory built on the minimally required\nSU(2) bsm-flavor doublet of two massless fermions, with a\nconfining gauge force on the TeV scale in the sextet\nrepresentation of the new SU(3) bsm-color is frequently discussed as an intriguing possibility \nfor the minimal realization of the composite Higgs mechanism.\n\nEarly discussions of the model as a BSM candidate were initiated in\nsystematic explorations of higher fermion representations of color gauge groups~\\cite{Dietrich:2005jn,Sannino:2004qp,Hong:2004td}\nfor extensions of the original Higgsless Technicolor paradigm~\\cite{Susskind:1978ms,Weinberg:1979bn}.\nIn fact, the first appearance of the particular two-index symmetric SU(3) fermion representation \ncan be traced even further back to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) where a doublet of sextet quarks\nwas proposed as a mechanism for Electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)\nwithout an elementary Higgs field~\\cite{Marciano:1980zf}. This idea had to be\nreplaced by a new\ngauge force at the TeV scale, orders of magnitude stronger than in QCD, to facilitate the dynamics \nof EWSB just below the lower edge of the conformal window in \nthe new BSM paradigm~\\cite{Dietrich:2005jn,Sannino:2004qp,Hong:2004td}.\nIt should be noted that throughout its early history the important near-conformal behavior \nof the model was a hypothesis only and definitive results had to wait for recent\nnon-perturbative investigations with lattice gauge theory methods\nas used in our work.\n\nNear-conformal BSM theories raise\nthe possibility of a light composite scalar, perhaps a Higgs impostor, to emerge from new strong dynamics,\nfar separated from the associated composite resonance spectrum in the few TeV mass range\nwith interesting and testable predictions for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). \nThis scenario is very different from what was expected from QCD when scaled up to the Electroweak scale,\nas illustrated by the failure of the Higgsless Technicolor paradigm.\nGiven the discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs particle at the LHC, any realistic BSM theory must contain a Higgs-like state, \nperhaps with some hidden composite structure.\n\n\nBased on our {\\it ab initio} non-perturbative  lattice calculations\n\nwe find\naccumulating evidence for near-conformal behavior in the sextet theory with\nthe emergent low mass  $0^{++}$ scalar state far separated from \nthe composite resonance spectrum of bosonic excitations in the 2-3 TeV energy range~\\cite{Fodor:2012ty,Fodor:2012ni,Fodor:2014pqa,Fodor:2015vwa}. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe identification of the light scalar state is numerically challenging since it\nrequires the evaluation of disconnected fermion loop contributions to correlators with vacuum quantum numbers\nin the range of light fermion masses we explore.\nThe evidence to date is very promising that the $0^{++}$ scalar is light \nin the chiral limit and that the model at this stage remains an important BSM candidate.\n\nIn Section 2 critically important features of the strongly coupled sextet gauge sector \nof the light scalar are briefly reviewed.\nIn Section 3 we discuss the Electroweak interactions of sextet fermions and their Electroweak multiplet structure.\nThe outlook beyond the Standard Model under global and gauge anomaly constraints is presented in Section 4 \nincluding the choice for new leptons under the requirement of integer electric charges for dark baryons.\nIn Section 5 dark baryons from the sextet Electroweak multiplet structure are constructed \nwith discussion of model constraints based on galactic and terrestrial relic densities from the early Universe.\nSection 6 describes the construction of lattice baryon operators using staggered lattice fermions \nin the sextet color representation. Our first non-perturbative lattice results on sextet baryon spectroscopy\nare presented in Section 7.  We conclude in Section 8 with a brief summary and outlook. \n\n\n\\section{Two critical features of the sextet strong force}\n\nThe foundation of the theory is based on chiral symmetry breaking (${\\rm \\chi SB}$) from the sextet gauge force\nin the massless fermion limit with three Goldstone bosons \nfor the minimal realization of the Higgs mechanism.\n\n\nIn our work from lattice simulations, the ${\\rm \\chi SB}$ pattern \n${\\rm SU(2)_L\\!\\otimes\\! SU(2)_R\\rightarrow SU(2)_V}$  in the  bsm-flavor group\nis consistent with the absence of any \nevidence for a conformal infrared fixed point (IRFP) at scales\nreached so far with the scale-dependent strong gauge coupling~\\cite{Fodor:2015zna}. \nThese two fundamental features are intrinsically interdependent.\nThe existence of an IRFP would make the sextet theory conformal with unbroken chiral symmetry\nimplying the disappearance of the finite temperature ${\\rm \\chi SB}$ transition of massless fermions\nin the continuum limit~\\cite{Kogut:2015zta}.\nThe phenomenological relevance of the sextet BSM model would be questioned in this case, perhaps with\nspeculative changes from previously unexplored new features, like the role of four-fermion operators \nin strongly coupled gauge dynamics.\nThe current understanding of the sextet theory shows no evidence for the paradigm shift \nfrom an IRFP as briefly argued below.\n\n\\subsection{The scale-dependent renormalized coupling and its $\\beta$-function}\n\nThere have been several lattice studies of the renormalized sextet gauge coupling and its $\\beta$-function \nusing different schemes. The first studies using the Schr\\\"{o}dinger functional method with tuned\nmassless Wilson fermions \nwere not decisive to rule in or rule out an IRFP in the explored range \nof the renormalized coupling~\\cite{DeGrand:2010na, Shamir:2008pb}. \nOur recent study using the gradient \nflow scheme with exactly massless staggered fermions and with full investigation \nof systematic effects in taking the continuum limit shows no evidence that the $\\beta$-function \nhas an infrared fixed point in the gauge coupling range ${\\rm 0 < g^2 < 6.5}$ investigated~\\cite{Fodor:2015zna}.  \nThis finding is consistent \nwith studies of the mass-deformed Goldstone spectrum and the spectrum of the Dirac operator which exhibits\nthe Banks-Casher condensate in the chiral limit~\\cite{Banks:1979yr,Fodor:2015vwa}.\nOur ongoing investigations include detailed studies of the mass-deformed Goldstone spectrum\nand the chiral condensate via the GMOR relation in chiral perturbation theory. \nPredictions for ${\\rm \\chi SB}$ from Random Matrix Theory are being tested from the lowest eigenvalues of the Dirac spectrum for high precision results.\n\nPreliminary results from concurrent studies of the scale-dependent renormalized coupling,\nusing the gradient flow method with\nWilson fermions in finite volumes, reported a conformal IRFP in the sextet $\\beta$-function \nwithin the ${\\rm g^2 \\sim 5.5-6.5}$ range where the 3-loop and 4-loop perturbative \n$\\beta$-functions  develop zeros in the ${\\rm \\overline{MS}}$ scheme~\\cite{Anna_g2}.\nThese preliminary results have been revised and no IRFP \nis reported anymore in the sextet $\\beta$-function~\\cite{Hasenfratz:2015ssa}, \nsimilar to our findings~\\cite{Fodor:2015zna}.\n\nIt should be noted that the precise determination of the very small $\\beta$-function \npresents challenges even for the best gradient flow based methods which \nwere deployed by both groups under discussion.\nNevertheless, the outcome of these difficult scale-dependent gauge coupling studies\nremains consistent with our expectation that the theory is very close \nto the lower edge of the conformal window with ${\\rm \\chi SB}$ but without an IRFP.\n\n\\subsection{Finite temperature chiral transition}\n\nBased on the existence of  ${\\rm \\chi SB}$ at zero temperature,\nit would be expected that chiral symmetry is restored in the sextet theory in a finite-temperature \nchiral transition. This has been the focus \nof recent work with evidence presented for a chiral transition \nat finite lattice cutoff~\\cite{Kogut:2011ty,Kogut:2010cz,Kogut:2015zta}. \nTracking the cutoff-dependent temperature of the chiral transition as the gauge coupling is varied,\nthe authors conclude that the chiral transition should disappear in the continuum limit \nand they report new-found indications for a conformal IRFP in the continuum model~\\cite{Kogut:2015zta}. \nThis finding is based on the scale-dependent variation of the $\\beta$-function with the bare and renormalized gauge\ncouplings, significantly slower than the expected 2-loop perturbative behavior \nin the renormalized weak coupling range ${\\rm g^2_R \\sim 1-3}$ but without the removal of cutoff effects\nin the $\\beta$-function and without control of other systematics which can qualitatively affect the conclusions of~\\cite{Kogut:2015zta}.\nIn particular, the simple Wilson gauge action and unimproved simple staggered fermion action  \nwere used in~\\cite{Kogut:2015zta} with known large cutoff effects and lacking systematic control \non the estimate of the renormalized coupling and its continuum limit, limited to simulations away from the\nrequired chiral limit~\\cite{Kogut:2015zta}.\nIn contrast, our direct determination of the $\\beta$-function from the gauge field gradient flow method when\nthe cutoff is removed and the continuum\nlimit is taken shows agreement with the 2-loop $\\beta$-function in the ${\\rm g^2_R \\sim 1-3}$ range \nwithout any sign of a conformal IRFP~\\cite{Fodor:2015zna}. \n\nTo resolve the apparent controversy, definitive and systematic finite temperature studies of ${\\rm \\chi SB}$  \nwould be needed in the massless fermion limit of this important gauge field theory\nclose to the lower edge of the conformal window.\n\n\n\\section{Electroweak multiplets and anomaly constraints}\n\nThe first direct test of the sextet theory is expected to come from the strongly coupled sector \nof the new gauge force which predicts \nresonances in the 2-3 TeV range within the reach of Run 2 at the LHC.\n\nAs an example, a rho-like vector state has been predicted in the model\nat approximately 2 TeV which could be observed as a diboson resonance \nexcess above LHC background events~\\cite{Fodor:2012ty,Fodor:2012ni,Fodor:2014pqa,Fodor:2015vwa}.\nIn Section 7 we will briefly comment on the recently reported diboson excess\nfrom the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, consistent with our prediction but far from settled.\nThe location of the rho-like resonance at 2 TeV would be less surprising in Higgsless Technicolor, \nbut the emergent light ${\\rm 0^{++}}$ scalar on the Electroweak scale, far \nseparated from the resonance spectrum in sextet dynamics, is a distinct and unexpected new feature.\nThe recently found diphoton excess from\nATLAS and CMS resonance searches~\\cite{diphoton:2015}  in the invariant \nmass range around 750 GeV would require very specific explanation\nof a light flavor singlet near-conformal state separated from the 2-3 TeV composite resonance range\nin strongly coupled  composite gauge theories~\\cite{Molinaro:2015cwg}.\n\nBuilding a BSM theory requires the embedding of the strongly coupled sextet fermion doublet\ninto the ${\\rm SU(2)_w\\!\\otimes\\!U(1)_Y}$ Electroweak gauge group with a new outlook \nbeyond the Standard Model under global and gauge anomaly constraints. \nWe will show that the general construction can accommodate new physics\non the Energy Frontier including new heavy leptons and massive neutrinos. The related dark\nmatter content of the theory implies interesting scenarios for future investigations. \nAs a first step, model building requires a consistent \nElectroweak multiplet structure with a simple realization \nof the composite Higgs mechanism from sextet gauge dynamics.\n\n\\subsection{The Electroweak (EW) multiplet structure of sextet fermions}\n\nAs in the minimal scheme of Susskind~\\cite{Susskind:1978ms} and Weinberg~\\cite{Weinberg:1979bn}, \nthe gauge group of the theory  is \n${\\rm SU(3)_{bsm}\\!\\otimes\\!SU(3)_c\\!\\otimes\\!SU(2)_w\\!\\otimes\\!U(1)_Y}$ where  ${\\rm SU(3)_c}$ designates \nthe QCD color gauge group and ${\\rm SU(3)_{bsm}}$ represents the BSM color gauge group \nof the new strong gauge force.\nIn addition to quarks and leptons of the Standard Model, we include one ${\\rm SU(2)}$ \nbsm-flavor doublet ${\\rm  (u,d)}$ of fermions which are ${\\rm SU(3)_c}$ singlets and transform \nin the six-dimensional sextet representation of bsm-color, distinct from\nthe fundamental color representation of fermions in the original Technicolor\nscheme~\\cite{Susskind:1978ms,Weinberg:1979bn}. \nThe formal designation ${\\rm  (u,d)}$ for the bsm-flavor doublet of sextet fermions uses a similar notation \nto the two light quarks of QCD but describes completely different physics. \nThe massless sextet fermions form two chiral doublets \n${\\rm (u,d)_L}$ and ${\\rm (u,d)_R}$ under the global symmetry group\n${\\rm SU(2)_L\\!\\otimes\\!SU(2)_R\\otimes\\!U(1)_B}$.

This motivated recent studies of the \neight-flavor fermion model to understand the\nstrong BSM force of the one-family model from several lattice studies~\\cite{Fodor:2009wk,Aoki:2014oha,Fodor:2015baa,Hasenfratz:2014rna,Appelquist:2014zsa,Schaich:2015psa}.\n\nThe  ${\\rm \\chi SB}$ pattern  ${\\rm SU(8)_L\\!\\otimes\\!SU(8)_R\\rightarrow SU(8)_V}$  generates 63 Goldstone bosons \nwith only three needed in the composite Higgs mechanism.\nGenerating masses for the excess unwanted Goldstone bosons  presents \nnon-trivial phenomenological challenges, making it more difficult to achieve the \ndesired goal of a near-conformal spectrum with a light $0^{++}$ scalar \nfar separated from resonance excitations.\n\n\\section{Constraints from global and gauge anomalies}\n\nAssuming that the strongly coupled gauge sector of the sextet model turns out to be compatible \nwith resonances \nin the 2-3 TeV region, a more complete BSM outlook of the model would come into focus,\nguided by anomaly constraints. \nWe will show that the existence of stable baryons in the sextet model when combined with our understanding \nof the early Universe requires anomalous fermion representation in the Electroweak sector. \n\nAlthough the sextet BSM model cannot offer a UV complete solution\nfor fermion mass generation and the related flavor problem, the outlook for new physics \nfrom extending the strongly coupled gauge sector guided by anomaly constraints is necessary. \n\nAnomaly compensating new physics has several important and immediate aspects \nwithout deference to physics on the scale of UV completion. \nIt provides an outlook and framework for new \nphysics the model can predict, or accommodate on several energy scales. \nAnomalies not only can predict or accommodate plausible new\nfermion content at the TeV scale but also give insight into\nElectroweak corrections to Standard Model expectations.\nThe example we will provide below is the anomaly canceling \npair of two massive lepton doublets (and associated right-handed singlets) to cancel the \nanomalies in Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:Banomaly1}) and (\\ref{eq:Banomaly2}) from left-handed sextet fermion\ndoublets. New charged lepton \nand neutrino masses are partially constrained parameters in this anomaly matching extension.\nEven if the new fermion masses are set to very high energy scales, \ntheir infrared effects from the associated anomaly content will always survive. \nThe best known examples of this footprint from integrating out heavy fermions include\nthe Wess-Zumino effective action and other residual effects on the Electroweak scale~\\cite{D'Hoker:1984ph,D'Hoker:1984pc,Preskill:1990fr,D'Hoker:1992bv}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Anomaly conditions in the sextet model}\n\nAnomaly constraints have a long history in Technicolor motivated BSM model building with \nrepresentative examples \nin~\\cite{Dietrich:2005jn,Kainulainen:2006wq,Foadi:2007ue,Antola:2009wq,Kainulainen:2009rb}.\nThe first condition for model construction with left-handed doublets is the global Witten anomaly \nconstraint which requires an even number of left-handed SU(2) multiplets to \navoid inconsistency in the theory from a vanishing fermion determinant of the partition function~\\cite{Witten:1982fp}.\n\nIn addition, gauge anomaly constraints also have to be satisfied~\\cite{Adler:1969er}. \nWith vector current ${\\rm  V^i_\\mu(x)=\\overline{\\psi}T^i\\gamma_\\mu\\psi(x)}$ and axial current \n ${\\rm A^i_\\mu(x)=\\overline{\\psi}T^i\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5\\psi(x)}$\nconstructed from fermion fields and internal symmetry matrices ${\\rm T^i}$ in some group representation \nR for fermions, the anomaly in the axial vector Ward\nidentity is proportional to ${\\rm tr(\\{T^i(R),T^j(R)\\}T^k(R))}$ and must vanish. \nIn the sextet theory fermions are either left-handed doublets or right-handed singlets \nunder the ${\\rm SU(2)_w}$ gauge group. \nThe matrices ${\\rm T^i}$  will be either the ${\\rm \\tau^i}$ Pauli matrices \nor the diagonal ${\\rm U(1)}$ hypercharge ${\\rm Y}$.\nSince the ${\\rm SU(2)}$  group is  anomaly free, ${\\rm tr(\\{\\tau^i,\\tau^j\\}\\tau^k)=0}$, \nwe only need to consider anomalies where at least one ${\\rm T^i}$ is the hypercharge Y.\nThe non-trivial constraints come from two conditions on hypercharge traces,\n\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\n{\\rm tr(Y )=0, \\quad tr(Y^3) \\propto tr(Q^2T_3 - QT^2_3) = 0}\\;, \n\n\\label{eq:hyper}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\par&#10;{\\rm tr(Y)=0,\\quad tr(Y^{3})\\propto tr(Q^{2}T_{3}-QT^{2}_{3})=0}\\;,\\par&#10;\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>tr</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>tr</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u221d</mo><mrow><mi>tr</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mi>QT</mi><mn>3</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><mn>0</mn></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03302.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nleading to fractional charges ${\\rm Q(u_L) = 1/2}$ and ${\\rm Q(d_L) = -1/2}$ from the \n${\\rm Y=2(Q-T_3)}$ relation. \nHypercharges  in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:typeA})  \nare set for right-handed fermions  from consistent electric charge \nassignments ${\\rm Q(u_R) = 1/2}$ and ${\\rm Q(d_R) = -1/2}$. \n\nThe minimal Electroweak content with the choice ${\\rm Y(f_L)=0}$  \nleads \n\nto baryon states of three constituents forming flavor isospin doublets \nwith a half unit of positive electric charge for isospin +1/2 with (uud) content and a half unit of negative electric charge\nfor isospin -1/2 with (udd) content.

This leads to the\nsimplest choice  ${\\rm Y(f_L)=1/3}$ with gauge anomalies to be compensated. \nA new pair of left-handed lepton \ndoublets emerged from this choice in Section 4 as the simplest manifestation \nof the anomalies and the Electroweak extension of the strongly coupled sextet gauge sector.\n\nNeutron-like ${\\rm udd}$ sextet model baryons ${\\rm (n_6)}$ will carry no electric charge \nand proton-like ${\\rm uud}$ sextet model baryons ${\\rm (p_6)}$ have one unit of positive electric charge \nfrom the choice ${\\rm Y(f_L)=1/3}$. \nThe two baryon masses are split by electromagnetic interactions.\nThe ordering of the two baryon masses in the chiral limit of massless sextet fermions will\nrequire non-perturbative {\\em ab initio} lattice calculations of the electromagnetic \nmass shifts to confirm intuitive expectations\nthat the neutron-like ${\\rm n_6}$ baryon has lower mass than the proton-like ${\\rm p_6}$ baryon.\nIn QCD this pattern was confirmed by recent lattice calculations~\\cite{Borsanyi:2014jba}.\nWe expect the same ordering in the sextet model so that the proton-like ${\\rm p_6}$  baryon \nwill decay very fast, ${\\rm p_6 \\rightarrow n_6 + ... }$,  with a lifetime ${\\rm \\tau \\ll 1~second}$. \nIt is unlikely for rapidly decaying  ${\\rm p_6}$ baryons to leave any relic footprints \nfrom dark nucleosynthesis before they decay.\n\nWith BSM baryon number conservation the neutral ${\\rm n_6}$ baryon is stable \nand observational limits on its direct detection from experiments like \nXENON100~\\cite{Aprile:2012nq} and LUX2013~\\cite{Akerib:2013tjd} have to be estimated.\nIn charge symmetric thermal evolution sextet model baryons are produced with relic number density ratio\n${\\rm  n_{B_6}/n_B  \\approx 3\\cdot 10^{-7}}$ (Eq.~\\ref{eq:annihil}).\nFor 3 TeV sextet model baryon masses we can estimate the detectable dark matter ratio of \nrespective mass densities ${\\rm \\rho_{B_6}}$ and ${\\rm \\rho_{B}}$ as\n${\\rm \\rho_{B_6}/\\rho_B  \\approx 10^{-4}}$,\nabout ${\\rm 5\\cdot 10^{4}}$ times less than the full amount of unaccounted dark mass, \n${\\rm \\rho_{dark} \\approx 5\\cdot \\rho_B}$.  \nWe will use this mass density estimate to guide observational limits on relic sextet model baryons\nemerging from charge symmetric thermal evolution where\ntests of dark baryon detection come from elastic collisions with nuclei in dark matter detectors.\nThe neutral and stable ${\\rm n_6}$ \nbaryon can interact several different ways with heavy nuclei in direct detection experiments\nincluding (a) magnetic dipole interaction, (b) Z-boson exchange, (c) Higgs boson exchange, and \n(d) electric polarizability.\n\nA brief review of our estimates of these interactions will lead us to important observations from what follows.\nIt turns out that cross sections from (a) and (b) can be parametrized and well estimated without \nlattice simulations.\n\n(a) The magnetic moment ${\\rm \\mu_6 = g\\cdot e/2M_{n_6}}$  of the neutral ${\\rm n_6}$ sextet baryon\ncan be calculated from first principles on the lattice but the only unknown quantity, g,\nis not needed in our estimate. The magnetic moment ${\\rm \\mu_6}$ of ${\\rm n_6}$ controls the coherent scattering cross section \nfrom magnetic moments of protons and neutrons in heavy nuclei with slow elastic recoil in direct detection \nexperiments. If the mass density of relic ${\\rm n_6}$ baryons would be large enough to match \nall the missing dark matter, a limit on the magnetic dipole g-factor from LUX2013 would be set \nto ${\\rm g^2 \\leq (M_{n_6}/5.1~TeV)^3}$, otherwise they would have been detected~\\cite{Akerib:2013tjd}. \nWith ${\\rm M_{n_6} = 3~TeV}$ the limiting value ${\\rm g=0.45}$ can be far exceeded \ndue to the much lower relic mass density of ${\\rm n_6}$ in the symmetric thermal evolution of the Universe. \nThe precise value of ${\\rm g}$ would require a straightforward lattice calculation which is less\nimportant with low magnetic dipole cross sections well below observational limits in comparison with\ncross section estimates from Z-exchange.\n\n(b) The sextet model ${\\rm n_6}$ baryon carries isospin 1/2 and hypercharge \n${\\rm Y=1}$ which is the source to the Z-boson field.\nCoherent Z exchange between the ${\\rm n_6}$ baryon and heavy nuclei in detectors of direct searches\nleads to larger cross section than magnetic dipole scattering and detectability has to be carefully\ncalculated and compared with XENON100 data.\nIs the sextet model with its relic  baryon density  still safe against the \nmost sensitive detection limits in charge symmetric thermal evolution?  This turns out to be the most sensitive\ntest of the model. For dark matter candidates at ${\\rm M_{n_6} = 3~TeV}$ XENON100 \nsets a cross section bound of approximately\n${\\rm 10^{-43} cm^2}$ per nucleon under the assumption of full dark matter missing mass density of\n${\\rm \\rho_{dark} \\approx 5\\cdot \\rho_B}$.\nNow our estimate of the cross section from Z exchange per nucleon for  ${\\rm n_6}$  is \napproximately ${\\rm 10^{-39} cm^2}$, seemingly four orders of magnitude above detection threshold. \nThis is not the case however, because the ${\\rm n_6}$ relic charge symmetric mass density is about \n${\\rm 5\\cdot 10^{4}}$ times less than the full amount of unaccounted dark mass. This leads to the\ninteresting observation that the  ${\\rm n_6}$ sextet model baryons might be detectable in the \nnext generation of direct searches. There are several caveats to this including uncertainties in estimating\nthe relic density from hypothesized annihilation cross sections and the complications of asymmetric thermal\nevolution. \n\n(c) The Higgs exchange effect is expected to be small but it will require lattice calculation to determine the \ncoupling of the composite light scalar to the ${\\rm n_6}$ sextet model baryon. We will return to this problem\nin a future report.\n\n(d) Similarly, the estimate of the scattering cross section from electric polarizability of ${\\rm n_6}$ baryons requires \nlattice calculations which are left for future work. This effect is expected to be much smaller than cross sections\nfor (a) and (b).\n\nBased on these estimates we conclude that the sextet BSM model is consistent with observational limits and \nwill contribute a small fraction to the missing dark matter content.\nAs a last and important step of our analysis, we turn now to the non-perturbative lattice determination of the baryon masses.\n \n\n\\section{Construction of the sextet nucleon operator}\n\nWe next discuss how to build a sextet baryon operator that can be used in lattice simulations to isolate the baryon state and measure its mass. In the first two parts of this section we discuss the color, spin and flavor structure of the sextet baryon\nstate in the continuum.  We will see that a symmetric color contraction is needed in order to construct a color singlet three-fermion state when fermions are in the sextet representation of ${\\rm SU(3)}$. This is opposite to the behavior in QCD, where the baryon color wave function is antisymmetric. Consequently, the  construction of the sextet baryon operator is non-trivial using staggered lattice fermions, which we describe in the third part of this section. \n\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\n\\subsection{Color structure}\n\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\nThree ${\\rm SU(3)}$ sextet fermions can give rise to a color singlet. The tensor product $6 \\otimes 6 \\otimes 6$ can be decomposed \ninto irreducible representations of ${\\rm SU(3)}$ as \\cite{maria}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n6 \\otimes 6 \\otimes 6= 1\\oplus2\\times 8\\oplus 10\\oplus {\\overline}{10}\\oplus 3\\times 27\\oplus 28\\oplus 2\\times 35,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere irreps are denoted by their dimensions and ${\\overline}{10}$ is the complex conjugate of 10.\nThe color singlet state corresponds to the unique singlet above. Fermions in the $6$-representation $\\psi_{ab}$ are symmetric in the two indices and transform as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\psi_{aa'} \\longrightarrow U_{ab}~U_{a'b'}~\\psi_{bb'}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nand the color singlet combination is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\epsilon_{abc}~\\epsilon_{a'b'c'}~\\psi_{aa'}~ \\psi_{bb'}~ \\psi_{cc'}\\;.\n\\end{eqnarray} \n(We earlier used superscripts for clarity.) Let us introduce the index $A=1,\\ldots, 6$ for the $6$ components of the symmetric $\\psi_{ab}$, i.e.~switch notation to\n$\\psi_{ab} = \\Psi_A$. Then the above color singlet operator may be written as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\epsilon_{abc}~\\epsilon_{a'b'c'}~\\psi_{aa'}~ \\psi_{bb'}~ \\psi_{cc'} = T_{ABC}~ \\Psi_A~ \\Psi_B~ \\Psi_C,\n\\label{colorsinglet}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith a completely symmetric 3-index tensor $T_{ABC}$. The contrast with QCD where the baryon color contraction is antisymmetric is here explicit.\n\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\n\\subsection{Spin flavor structure}\n\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\nAs we have seen the color contraction is symmetric for the sextet representation and hence the overall antisymmetry\nof the baryon wave function with respect to the interchange of any two fermions  must come from the spin-flavor structure. Our operator construction is fully relativistic, we look here at the non-relativistic limit for illustration, omitting color indices. We label the two flavors \n$u$ and $d$ as in QCD and the non-relativistic spin will be either $\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$. We start with $| \\uparrow u, \\uparrow d, \\downarrow u \\rangle$ and build the desired state by requiring it to be antisymmetric under all possible interchanges, leading to\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{psi}\n| \\uparrow \\psi  \\rangle = \n| \\uparrow u, \\uparrow d, \\downarrow u \\rangle + \n| \\downarrow u, \\uparrow u, \\uparrow d \\rangle + \n| \\uparrow d, \\downarrow u, \\uparrow u \\rangle - {\\nonumber} \\\\\n| \\downarrow u, \\uparrow d, \\uparrow u \\rangle - \n| \\uparrow d, \\uparrow u, \\downarrow u \\rangle - \n| \\uparrow u, \\downarrow u, \\uparrow d \\rangle\\;,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich is similar to the wave function of triton~\\cite{Derrick58}.\n\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\n\\subsection{From continuum Dirac to lattice Staggered basis}\n\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\nWe next convert from continuum to staggered lattice fermion operators. The lattice operators that create the state (\\ref{psi}) belong to a suitable multiplet of ${\\rm SU(4)}$ taste symmetry. Our staggered fermion operator construction follows \\cite{gs, KlubergStern:1983dg, Altmeyer:1992dd, Ishizuka:1993mt}. We first convert from continuum operators to lattice operators in the Dirac basis, then we switch to lattice staggered fields. For simplicity we want to have operators as local as possible, thus in Dirac basis, our sextet baryon operator takes the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nN^{\\alpha i}(2y)~=T_{ABC}~ u_A^{\\alpha i}(2y) ~[u_B^{\\beta j}(2y) ~(C \\gamma_5 )_{\\beta \\gamma} \n~(C^* \\gamma_5^*)_{jk}~d_C^{\\gamma k}(2y)]\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere Greek letters and lower case Latin letters denote spin and taste indices respectively. $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix satisfying\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nC\\gamma_\\mu C^{-1}=-\\gamma_\\mu^{{\\rm T}},{\\nonumber}\\\\\n-C=C^{{\\rm T}}=C^\\dagger=C^{-1}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe coordinate $y$ labels elementary staggered hypercubes.\nStaggered fields are defined as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nu^{\\alpha i}(2y)=\\frac{1}{8}\\sum_\\eta \\Gamma^{\\alpha i}_\\eta~ \\chi_u(2y+\\eta)\\;, {\\nonumber}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Gamma(\\eta)$ is an element of the Euclidean Clifford algebra labeled by the four-vector \n$\\eta$ whose elements are defined mod 2 as usual.\nMore precisely \n$\\Gamma(\\eta)=\\gamma_1^{\\eta_1}\\gamma_2^{\\eta_2}\\gamma_3^{\\eta_3}\\gamma_4^{\\eta_4}$ where \n$\\eta \\equiv (\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\eta_3, \\eta_4)$.\nWritten in terms of the staggered fields,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nN^{\\alpha i}(2y)~=-T_{ABC}~\\frac{1}{8^3}\\sum_{\\eta'} \\Gamma^{\\alpha i}_{\\eta'}~ \\chi_u^A(2y+\\eta')\n~\\sum_{\\eta }  S(\\eta)\\chi_u^B(2y+\\eta) \\chi_d^C(2y+\\eta)\\;,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $S(\\eta)$ is a sign factor.\nTo obtain a single time slice operator an extra term has to be either added to or subtracted from the diquark operator to cancel\nthe spread over two time slices of the unit hypercube. This is similar to what is done to construct \nthe single time slice meson operators in QCD. This extra term corresponds to the parity partner of the nucleon.\nThe single time slice nucleon operator reads\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nN^{\\alpha i}(2y)~=-T_{ABC}~\\frac{1}{8^3}\\sum_{{\\vec \\eta'}} \\Gamma^{\\alpha i}_{{\\vec \\eta'}}~ \\chi_u^A(2y+{\\vec \\eta'})\n~\\sum_{{\\vec \\eta} }  S({\\vec \\eta})\\chi_u^B(2y+{\\vec \\eta}) \\chi_d^C(2y+{\\vec \\eta}).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis operator is a sum of $8\\times 8=64$ terms over the elementary cube in a given time slice. \nThe local terms vanish individually after the symmetric \ncolor contraction. The non-vanishing terms are those where a diquark resides on a corner of the cube at a fixed \ntime-slice and the third fermion resides\non any of the other corners. The nucleon operator is thus the sum of $56$ such terms with appropriate sign factors. \nIn order to find the mass of the lowest lying state any one of these $56$ terms can in principle be used.\nWe list in Table \\ref{operators} the operators that we have implemented.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \n\\hline\nLabel  &  Operators (set a) & Operators (set b)  \\\\\n\\hline\n ${\\rm IV_{{\\rm xy}}}$   & $\\chi_u(1,1,0,0)~\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_d(0,0,0,0)$&$\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_u(1,1,0,0)~\\chi_d(1,1,0,0)$\\\\\n \\hline\n ${\\rm IV_{{\\rm yz}}}$   & $\\chi_u(0,1,1,0)~\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_d(0,0,0,0)$&$\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_u(0,1,1,0)~\\chi_d(0,1,1,0)$\\\\\n \\hline\n ${\\rm IV_{{\\rm zx}}}$   & $\\chi_u(1,0,1,0)~\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_d(0,0,0,0)$&$\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_u(1,0,1,0)~\\chi_d(1,0,1,0)$\\\\\n \\hline\n VIII   & $\\chi_u(1,1,1,0)~\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_d(0,0,0,0)$&$\\chi_u(0,0,0,0)~\\chi_u(1,1,1,0)~\\chi_d(1,1,1,0)$\\\\\n \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The set of staggered lattice baryon operators we used to determine the baryon mass.}\n\\label{operators}\n\\end{table}  \n\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\n\\section{Lattice simulations}\n\n\\vspace{-0.2cm}\n\nWe use the same lattice action as in our other studies of the sextet model, namely the tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge\naction and the staggered fermion matrix with two stout steps of exponential smearing of the gauge link variables with two\nstout steps~\\cite{Morningstar:2003gk, Aoki:2005vt}. We implement the RHMC algorithm with the rooting procedure in all simulations to study the model with two fermion flavors. To accelerate the molecular dynamics time evolution we use multiple time scales~\\cite{Urbach:2005ji} and the Omelyan integrator~\\cite{Takaishi:2005tz}. The results we show here are at one lattice spacing corresponding to the bare gauge coupling $\\beta = 6 / g^2 = 3.2$, which is defined as the overall prefactor of the Symanzik lattice action. We have continuing studies of the spectrum on finer lattice spacings to allow us to quantify lattice artifacts and determine the continuum limit of the spectrum, which we will report on in future publications. We examine the time histories of the correlators, the fermion condensate, the topological charge, and the gauge field energy on the gradient flow to estimate autocorrelation times. For the estimate of the statistical errors of hadron masses we used correlated fitting of the effective masses with a double jackknife procedure applied to the covariance matrices~\\cite{delDebbio}.\n\n\\subsection{Nucleon operator comparison}\n\nWe investigate the quality of the signal for the operators listed in Table \\ref{operators} on ensembles of approximately 1000 trajectories, each measurement separated by 50 trajectories during the molecular dynamics evolution, on a lattice volume $V=32^3 \\times 64$ and at fermion mass $m=0.007$. For each operator the nucleon mass, $M_N$, is determined by correlated fitting of the effective mass with a double jackknife procedure applied to the covariance matrices from time separation $t_{min}$ to $t_{max}$. Figure \\ref{signal_comparison} compares the\ncorresponding fits for various values of $t_{min}$ at $t_{max}=20$. It is observed that,\nfor all operators, the fits are not very sensitive to the choice of the fit range. Moreover, all\noperators give consistent results for the nucleon mass within errors. The noise-to-signal\nratio is around $\\sim 5\\%$ for all operators, none of which is significantly\nless noisy than the others. Therefore the quality of the resulting spectroscopy is\nindependent of the choice of operator, and in the following analysis we use the operator\n$IV_{xy}$ from set $a$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\scalebox{0.75}{\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.85\\textwidth]{compare_tmax20}}\n\\vskip -.3 cm\n\\caption{{\\footnotesize Comparison of $M_N$ from different operators varying $t_{min}$ \nwith fixed $t_{max}=20$.

The $t_{min}$ \nvalues for the operators $IV_{xy}$, $IV_{yz}$ and $IV_{zx}$ are shifted by $0.25$,\n$0.5$ and $0.75$ respectively for clarity.

Simulations and data analysis of the sextet model are continuously ongoing, what we show here is a snapshot of the results at one lattice spacing. The nucleon correlator of operator\n$IV_{xy}$ in set $a$ is measured on ensembles with lattice volume $V = 32^3 \\times 64$ and fermion masses ranging from $m=0.003$ to $m=0.008$, each with 200 to 300 configurations, each configuration separated by 5 Monte Carlo trajectories. In Figure \\ref{chiral} we show the chiral extrapolation of $M_N$, as well as extrapolations of the Goldstone boson, the $a_1$ and $\\rho$ mesons, denoted by $M_\\pi$, $M_{a_1}$ and $M_\\rho$ respectively \\cite{Fodor:2012ty, ourfuture}. For all except the Goldstone boson state we assume linear dependence on the fermion mass towards the chiral limit. We see the baryon remains significantly split from the meson sector of the spectrum in the chiral limit.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\scalebox{0.65}{\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=1.0\\textwidth]{chiral_all}}\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\\caption{\n{\\footnotesize Chiral extrapolation of $M_N$ (blue) in comparison with\n$M_\\pi$, $M_{a_1}$ and $M_\\rho$. \nThe calculation is performed on lattices with $\\beta=3.20$, $V=48^3 \\times 96$ \nfor $m=0.003$ (except for $M_N$ on $V=32^3 \\times 64$) and $V=32^3 \\times 64$ for \nthe heavier fermion masses, using 200 to 300 configurations at each mass.}\n}\n\\label{chiral}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\scalebox{0.55}{\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=1.0\\textwidth]{FpiLinFit_b3p20}}\n~ ~ ~\n\\scalebox{0.18}{\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=1.0\\textwidth]{all_channels}}\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\\caption{{\\footnotesize Chiral extrapolation of $F_\\pi$.

Hadron spectroscopy at $\\beta=3.20$ converted to physical units (right).}}\\label{physical}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo convert to physical units, one can use the scale set by the chiral limit of the Goldstone boson decay constant $F_\\pi$, denoted by $F$.  The left plot of figure \\ref{physical} shows the chiral\nextrapolation of $F_\\pi$, measured on lattices of size $48^3 \\times 96$ for $m=0.003$ and $32^3 \\times 64$ for the heavier fermion masses. A detailed description of the analysis is given in~\\cite{ourfuture}, the result we use here is $F=0.0253(4)$. The value in the chiral limit is likely to evolve, due to additional lattice simulations pushing to even lighter fermion mass, as well as modifications of the analysis taking into account lattice artifacts. The BSM implementation of the theory identifies the chiral limit of the Goldstone boson decay constant with the value of the scalar vacuum expectation value in the Standard Model, namely $F= v_R = 246$~GeV. This requirement follows from the generation of the Electroweak gauge boson mass $m_W = (g F)/2$ due to Goldstone boson contributions to the gauge boson vacuum polarization.\nWith this conversion, the baryon in the chiral limit is at approximately $3$~TeV. The nucleon, vector and axial vector meson masses are shown in physical units on the right panel of figure \\ref{physical}. Our initial studies indicate a composite scalar in the sextet model which is light, with $M_{\\rm H}/F$ in the range 1 to 3 in the chiral limit~\\cite{Fodor:2015vwa}. The large uncertainty is due to the difficulty of extracting a state with vacuum quantum numbers, which requires disconnected fermion diagrams to be calculated, a notoriously challenging computational problem. The lightness of the scalar, far separated from the remainder of the spectrum, means in the BSM context that experimental studies would need to explore the few TeV range for this model to be critically tested~\\cite{Aad:2015yza}.  \n\nIt has recently been reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations that there is an observed excess in $WW, WZ$ and $ZZ$ diboson pairs at around 2 TeV~\\cite{Aad:2015owa,CMS:2015gla}. One possible explanation is a vector resonance, which in our context would be the $\\rho$ state. As indicated in figure \\ref{physical}, the simulation results predict that the vector state is at roughly 2 TeV in the sextet model. This prediction will be refined in our ongoing study, including the dependence on the lattice cutoff, and will become of growing importance if the experimental excess persists. In Section 3 we already commented briefly on the recently found \ndiphoton excess in ATLAS and CMS resonance searches~\\cite{diphoton:2015}.\n\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\n\\section{Summary and outlook}\n\n\\vspace{-0.2cm}\n\nWe have developed the operator technology to extract baryon states using staggered lattice fermions in the sextet model. The first results are encouraging that the lightest baryon mass can be nailed down with good precision from the current generation of lattice simulations. The emerging picture is of a spectrum with the baryon significantly above the vector and axial vector mesons in the chiral limit. The next step will be to extend the analysis, allowing more control over the chiral extrapolation and removing the distortion of the spectrum due to lattice artifacts and possible finite-volume contamination.\n\nThe study of the baryon is a natural extension of our ongoing work to explore the meson spectrum of the sextet model and shore up the case that the theory is near-conformal, with a massive spectrum in the chiral limit. Whether or not the model is ultimately viable will largely hinge on the fate of the composite scalar, which should be light for the minimal model to dynamically generate a Higgs impostor. The embedding of the sextet theory into the Standard Model brings other facets into play, such as constraints on the relic abundance of sextet model baryons in the early Universe, and experimental limits on stable particles with fractional charge~\\cite{Perl:2009zz}. The scenario of a neutral sextet baryon with additional lepton doublets for anomaly cancellation shows the possibility for rich BSM physics beyond simply a composite Higgs state, and will be brought into sharp relief if the model continues to warrant future study.  \n\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\n\\section{Acknowledgement}\n\n\\vspace{-0.2cm}\n\n\n\nWe acknowledge support by the DOE under grant DE-SC0009919,\nby the NSF under grants 0970137 and 1318220, by the DOE ALCC award for the BG/Q Mira platform\nof Argonne National Laboratory, by OTKA under the grant OTKA-NF-104034, and by the Deutsche\nForschungsgemeinschaft grant SFB-TR 55.
