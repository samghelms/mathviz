Taking this fact as a departure point it is natural to seek  what would the natural correspondence be for projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structures.       \n\nProjective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structures were first introduced by T. Irwin and S. Solecki in \\cite{Irwin}. These are zero-dimensional, compact, topological structures which provide a dual to the classical {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structures. However, the duality in \\cite{Irwin} was not explicitly present in the structure as such but rather in the morphisms that were used in the amalgamating process. In the same paper they used the projective limit of finite, reflexive, linear graphs in language ${\\mathcal{L}}_R=\\{R\\}$, where $R$ is a binary relation symbol, to provide a simple description of the unique hereditary, idecomposable, chainable continuum known as the pseudo-arc. This enabled them to deduce new results regarding the pseudo-arc and to show how previously known facts about it (e.g., projective universality and homogeneity) were linked at a deeper level. \n\n\nSince then, projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} constructions were used by several authors in the study of compact spaces and their homeomorphisms groups e.g., \\cite{Lelek}, \\cite{Ample}, \\cite{Large}. There is standard scheme in the analysis that appears in these papers. One starts with a second-countable compact space $Y$ where either $Y$ or the group ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$ is under investigation. Then one defines an appropriate class ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of finite model theoretic ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures  which ``approximate'' $Y$. If this class ${\\mathcal{K}}$ satisfies the ``projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{}'' axioms \\cite{Irwin} then the projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limit ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ of ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is uniquely defined. Since the domain $M$ of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is a zero-dimensional space one cannot expect to equate it with $Y$ which is in general not zero-dimensional. However, in all the cases cited above the structures appearing in ${\\mathcal{K}}$ were classes of graphs perhaps with extra model theoretic structure added on top. The edge relation $R$ was part of the language ${\\mathcal{L}}$ and in the limit ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ the relation $R^{{\\boldsymbol{M}}}$ always turned out to be an equivalence relation. The quotient ${\\boldsymbol{M}}/R^{{\\boldsymbol{M}}}$ was equal to $Y$ and the map ${\\mathrm{Aut}}({\\boldsymbol{M}})\\to{\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$ that was induced by the quotient was a continuous embedding with dense image in ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$. This allowed the study of $Y$ and ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$ via the combinatorial properties of the {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} class ${\\mathcal{K}}$.\n\nThe purpose of this note is to turn this observations to a general method. However, this is not always possible if we insist to use only classical model theoretic structure as done in \\cite{Irwin}. We rewrite the theory developed in \\cite{Irwin} dualizing it not only in the level of the morphisms but also in the level of structures i.e. we also allow dual predicates in ${\\mathcal{L}}$ which quantify over dual tuples (finite clopen partitions). We will call a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure purely dual if ${\\mathcal{L}}$ contains only dual predicates.\n\nIn Chapter \\ref{Chapter_closed_subgroups_of_Homeo} we use a standard orbit completion argument  (i.e., we add extra predicates; one for every orbit) and equipping ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(K)$ with the compact-open topology we get the following result.      \n\n\\begin{theorem*}[\\textbf{\\ref{theorem orbits}}]\nLet $G$ be a closed subgroup of ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(K)$ where $K$ is zero-dimensional, compact, second-countable space. Then there is a purely dual projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structure ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$ on domain $K$ such that ${\\mathrm{Aut}}({\\boldsymbol{K}})=G$. \n\\end{theorem*}   \n\nTheorem \\ref{theorem orbits} should be thought of as the dual of the statement that wants every closed subgroup of $S_\\infty$ to be the automorphism group of a classical {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limit. In Chapter \\ref{direct to dual} we provide a method which allows to turn any topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure into a purely dual one without losing any information. We also show  that above theorem is false if we do not allow our structures to support a dual structure. Therefore the context of dual structures is strictly more general then the context of direct structures. \n\n In Chapter \\ref{Compact spaces} we fix a special binary  relation symbol $\\mathfrak{r}$ whose interpretation will always be a reflexive and symmetric closed relation. This should paralleled with the  metric {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} theory where the symbol $d$ is  reserved as a signifier for the metric.  A formal relational language ${\\mathcal{L}}$ will be decorated with the subscript $\\mathfrak{r}$ whenever $\\mathfrak{r}$ belongs to ${\\mathcal{L}}$. Therefore, we always have  $\\mathfrak{r}\\in{\\mathcal{L}}_\\mathfrak{r}$ and ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\mathfrak{r}$-structures are always in particular reflexive $\\mathfrak{r}$-graphs. We say that an ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\mathfrak{r}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$ is a pre-space if $\\mathfrak{r}^{{\\boldsymbol{K}}}$ is moreover transitive and therefore an equivalence relation. We apply Theorem \\ref{theorem orbits} to get the following result.\n\n\\begin{theorem*}[\\textbf{\\ref{compactSpacesMainTheorem}}]\nFor every second-countable, compact space $Y$ there is a projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} pre-space ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$ such that: \n", "index": 1, "text": "\n\\[\\big(K \\big/\\mathfrak{r}^{{\\boldsymbol{K}}}\\big) \\cong_{\\mathrm{homeo}} Y.\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\big{(}K\\big{/}\\mathfrak{r}^{{\\boldsymbol{K}}}\\big{)}\\cong_{\\mathrm{homeo}}Y.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo maxsize=\"120%\" minsize=\"120%\">(</mo><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo mathsize=\"120%\" stretchy=\"false\">/</mo><msup><mi>\ud835\udd2f</mi><mi>\ud835\udc72</mi></msup></mrow><mo maxsize=\"120%\" minsize=\"120%\">)</mo></mrow><msub><mo>\u2245</mo><mi>homeo</mi></msub><mi>Y</mi></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04392.tex", "nexttext": "    \n\nWe will call this kind of tuple a \\emph{direct tuple}.

Following Hodges and \\cite{Irwin} we present here the theory of {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limits of topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures via dual morphisms. To avoid confusion, we should emphasize two things. First, what in \\cite{Irwin} is called topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure, here it falls under the name purely direct topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure. Second, in \\cite{Irwin} a projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} class, in contrast with the definition that we will be using here, is not bound  to satisfy the hereditary property ($\\mathrm{HP}$).   \n\nWe say that a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is \\emph{projectively {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{}} or \\emph{projectively ultra-homogeneous} if for every two epimorphisms $f_1,f_2$ of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ on some finite topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ there is an automorphism $g$ of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ such that $f_1\\circ g=f_2$.\n\nFor every topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ we denote by $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ the class of all the finite topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ such that ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ epimorphs on ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$. We call a class ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures an \\emph{age} if ${\\mathcal{K}}=\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ for some topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$. It is immediate that if ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is an age, then ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is not empty, any subclass of ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of pairwise non-isomorphic structures is at most countable, and the following two properties hold for ${\\mathcal{K}}$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\emph{Hereditary Property} ($\\mathrm{HP}$): if ${\\boldsymbol{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ epimorphs onto a structure ${\\boldsymbol{B}}$, then ${\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$.\n\\item \\emph{Joint Surjecting Property} ($\\mathrm{JSP}$): if ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ then there is ${\\boldsymbol{C}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ that epimorphs onto both ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and  ${\\boldsymbol{B}}$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe converse is also true i.e. if ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is a non empty class of finite topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures such that any subclass of ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of pairwise non-isomorphic structures is at most countable and the above two properties hold for ${\\mathcal{K}}$ then  ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is an age. \n\nTo see this, let ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{A}}_2,\\ldots$ be a list of structures in ${\\mathcal{K}}$ that up to isomorphism  exhaust ${\\mathcal{K}}$. Using the $\\mathrm{JSP}$ we can find a new list ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{B}}_2,\\ldots$ of structures in ${\\mathcal{K}}$ such that ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_1={\\boldsymbol{A}}_1$ and for $i>1$, ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_{i+1}$ epimorphs on both ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_{i+1}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_{i}$. Let $\\pi_i:{\\boldsymbol{B}}_{i+1}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}_i$ be such epimorphisms and let ${\\boldsymbol{M}}=\\varprojlim({\\boldsymbol{B}}_i,\\pi_i)$. Then ${\\mathcal{K}}=\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ because by construction ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ epimorphs to every ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_i$ and moreover, every epimorphism of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ to some finite dual topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ factors through an epimorphism from some ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_i\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ that was used in the inverse system so, by $\\mathrm{HP}$ we have that ${\\boldsymbol{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$. \n\n\nGiven now that the structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is projectively ultr-ahomogeneous, it is easy to see that its age ${\\mathcal{K}}$ satisfies moreover the following property.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\emph{Projective Amalgamation Property} ($\\mathrm{PAP}$): if ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}},{\\boldsymbol{C}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and $f_A:{\\boldsymbol{A}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{C}}$, $f_B:{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{C}}$ are epimorphisms, then there is ${\\boldsymbol{D}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and epimorphisms $g_A:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $g_B:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ such that $f_A\\circ g_A= f_B\\circ g_B$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTo check that this is true, notice first that since ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$, there are epimorphisms $h_A:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $h_B:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$. But then $f_A \\circ h_A$ and $f_B \\circ h_B$ are both epimorphisms from ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ to ${\\boldsymbol{C}}$. So, by projective ultra-homogeneity of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ there is $\\phi\\in{\\mathrm{Aut}}{}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ such that $f_A \\circ h_A\\circ\\phi=f_B \\circ h_B$. Using Lemma \\ref{factors through lemma}, we can find ${\\boldsymbol{D}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and an epimorphism $h_D:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{D}}$ such that $h_A$ and $h_B\\circ\\phi^{-1}$ factor through $h_D$. Let $g_A:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $g_B:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ be the maps that close these diagrams, i.e., $g_A\\circ h_D=h_A$ and $g_B\\circ h_D=h_B\\circ\\phi^{-1}$.  The functions $g_A$ and  $g_B$ are the required epimorphisms from ${\\boldsymbol{D}}$ to ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{B}}$ in respect. \n\nIn Theorem \\ref{theorem dual Fraisse} we will see that the converse is also true, i.e., if an age ${\\mathcal{K}}$ has $\\mathrm{PAP}$ then we can built from it a projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ with $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})={\\mathcal{K}}$. An age ${\\mathcal{K}}$ that satisfies $\\mathrm{PAP}$ is called \\emph{projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} class}.\n\n\nLet ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ be a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure with $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})={\\mathcal{K}}$. We say that ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the \\emph{finite extension property} if for every ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and $f:{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $g:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ epimorphisms, there is an epimorphism $h:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ such that $f \\circ h=g$. We say that ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the \\emph{one point extension property} if the above holds when the size of $B$ is one more than the size of $A$. Notice that for any topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$, ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the one point extension property if and only if ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the finite extension property.\n\n\\begin{lm}\\label{finite extension to isomorphism lemma}\nLet ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ be two topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure of the same age ${\\mathcal{K}}$. Let ${\\boldsymbol{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and let $f:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $g:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ be two epimorphisms. If ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ have the finite extension property then there is an isomorphism $h:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{N}}$ such that $g\\circ h= f$. \n\\end{lm}\n\\begin{proof}\n \nWe will use a back and forth type of argument. For every $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ we will construct ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and epimorphisms $f_n:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to {\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$, $g_n:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to {\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$, and for every $n>0$ we will also construct an epimorphism $\\pi_{n-1}:{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\to {\\boldsymbol{A}}_{n-1}$.  At the end of the construction ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ will be proven to be isomorphic to $\\varprojlim({\\boldsymbol{A}}_n,\\pi_n)$. By using these indirect isomorphisms we will get the desired isomorphism $h$.  Let $\\{e_n: n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\}$ be an enumeration of dual tuples $m^M$ of $M$ for every $m>0$ and let $\\{e'_n: n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\}$ be an enumeration of dual tuples $m^N$ of $N$ for every $m>0$.\n\n$\\mathit{n=0}.$ Let ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_0={\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $f_0=f$ and  $g_0=g$.\n\n\\emph{odd} $\\mathit{n>0}$. Using Lemma \\ref{factors through lemma} we can find a structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ and an epimorphism $f_n:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ such that both $f_{n-1}$ and $e_{n-1}$ factor through $f_n$. Let $\\pi_{n-1}:{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_{n-1}$ be the epimorphism that closes the one diagram, i.e., $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ f_{n}=f_{n-1}$. Finally define $g_n:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ to be any map such that $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ g_n=g_{n-1}$. A map like this exists, since ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ satisfies the finite extension property.   \n\n\\emph{even} $\\mathit{n>0}$. Again, using Lemma \\ref{factors through lemma} we can find a structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ and an epimorphism $g_n:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ such that both $g_{n-1}$ and $e'_{n-1}$ factor through $g_n$. Let $\\pi_{n-1}:{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_{n-1}$ be the epimorphism that closes the one diagram, i.e., $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ g_{n}=g_{n-1}$. Finally define $f_n:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ to be any map such that $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ f_n=f_{n-1}$. A map like this exists, since ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ satisfies the finite extension property.   \n\nLet now ${\\boldsymbol{B}}=\\varprojlim({\\boldsymbol{A}}_n,\\pi_n)$. The maps $\\mu:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ with $\\mu(x)=(f_0(x),f_1(x),\\ldots)$ and $\\nu:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ with $\\nu(x)=(g_0(x),g_1(x),\\ldots)$ are bijections since the families $\\{e_n\\}$ and $\\{e'_n\\}$ separate points of $M$ and $N$ in respect. It is moreover easy to see that $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are actually isomorphisms. So, the map $h:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{N}}$ with $h=\\nu^{-1}\\circ\\mu$ is also an isomorphism which by construction satisfies the desired property  $g\\circ h= f$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lm}\\label{1 point=fraisse}\nLet ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ be a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure with $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})={\\mathcal{K}}$ then the following are equivalent:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is projectively ultra-homogeneous;\n\\item ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the finite extension property;\n\\item ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the one point extension property.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{lm}\n\\begin{proof}\nIt is immediate that (2) and (3) are equivalent. We prove that (1) is also equivalent to (2). \n\\item[$(1)\\to(2)$] Let ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and $f:{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $g:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ epimorphisms. Since ${\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}=\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$, there is an epimorphism $j:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$. So, $f\\circ j:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ is an epimorphism, and by the projective ultra-homogeneity of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ there is $\\phi\\in{\\mathrm{Aut}}{}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ with $g\\circ\\phi=f\\circ j$.

Following Hodges and \\cite{Irwin} we present here the theory of {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limits of topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures via dual morphisms. To avoid confusion, we should emphasize two things. First, what in \\cite{Irwin} is called topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure, here it falls under the name purely direct topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure. Second, in \\cite{Irwin} a projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} class, in contrast with the definition that we will be using here, is not bound  to satisfy the hereditary property ($\\mathrm{HP}$).   \n\nWe say that a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is \\emph{projectively {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{}} or \\emph{projectively ultra-homogeneous} if for every two epimorphisms $f_1,f_2$ of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ on some finite topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ there is an automorphism $g$ of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ such that $f_1\\circ g=f_2$.\n\nFor every topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ we denote by $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ the class of all the finite topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ such that ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ epimorphs on ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$. We call a class ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures an \\emph{age} if ${\\mathcal{K}}=\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ for some topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$. It is immediate that if ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is an age, then ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is not empty, any subclass of ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of pairwise non-isomorphic structures is at most countable, and the following two properties hold for ${\\mathcal{K}}$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\emph{Hereditary Property} ($\\mathrm{HP}$): if ${\\boldsymbol{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ epimorphs onto a structure ${\\boldsymbol{B}}$, then ${\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$.\n\\item \\emph{Joint Surjecting Property} ($\\mathrm{JSP}$): if ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ then there is ${\\boldsymbol{C}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ that epimorphs onto both ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and  ${\\boldsymbol{B}}$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe converse is also true i.e. if ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is a non empty class of finite topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures such that any subclass of ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of pairwise non-isomorphic structures is at most countable and the above two properties hold for ${\\mathcal{K}}$ then  ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is an age. \n\nTo see this, let ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{A}}_2,\\ldots$ be a list of structures in ${\\mathcal{K}}$ that up to isomorphism  exhaust ${\\mathcal{K}}$. Using the $\\mathrm{JSP}$ we can find a new list ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{B}}_2,\\ldots$ of structures in ${\\mathcal{K}}$ such that ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_1={\\boldsymbol{A}}_1$ and for $i>1$, ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_{i+1}$ epimorphs on both ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_{i+1}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_{i}$. Let $\\pi_i:{\\boldsymbol{B}}_{i+1}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}_i$ be such epimorphisms and let ${\\boldsymbol{M}}=\\varprojlim({\\boldsymbol{B}}_i,\\pi_i)$. Then ${\\mathcal{K}}=\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ because by construction ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ epimorphs to every ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_i$ and moreover, every epimorphism of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ to some finite dual topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ factors through an epimorphism from some ${\\boldsymbol{B}}_i\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ that was used in the inverse system so, by $\\mathrm{HP}$ we have that ${\\boldsymbol{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$. \n\n\nGiven now that the structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is projectively ultr-ahomogeneous, it is easy to see that its age ${\\mathcal{K}}$ satisfies moreover the following property.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\emph{Projective Amalgamation Property} ($\\mathrm{PAP}$): if ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}},{\\boldsymbol{C}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and $f_A:{\\boldsymbol{A}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{C}}$, $f_B:{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{C}}$ are epimorphisms, then there is ${\\boldsymbol{D}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and epimorphisms $g_A:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $g_B:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ such that $f_A\\circ g_A= f_B\\circ g_B$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTo check that this is true, notice first that since ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$, there are epimorphisms $h_A:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $h_B:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$. But then $f_A \\circ h_A$ and $f_B \\circ h_B$ are both epimorphisms from ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ to ${\\boldsymbol{C}}$. So, by projective ultra-homogeneity of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ there is $\\phi\\in{\\mathrm{Aut}}{}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ such that $f_A \\circ h_A\\circ\\phi=f_B \\circ h_B$. Using Lemma \\ref{factors through lemma}, we can find ${\\boldsymbol{D}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and an epimorphism $h_D:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{D}}$ such that $h_A$ and $h_B\\circ\\phi^{-1}$ factor through $h_D$. Let $g_A:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $g_B:{\\boldsymbol{D}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ be the maps that close these diagrams, i.e., $g_A\\circ h_D=h_A$ and $g_B\\circ h_D=h_B\\circ\\phi^{-1}$.  The functions $g_A$ and  $g_B$ are the required epimorphisms from ${\\boldsymbol{D}}$ to ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{B}}$ in respect. \n\nIn Theorem \\ref{theorem dual Fraisse} we will see that the converse is also true, i.e., if an age ${\\mathcal{K}}$ has $\\mathrm{PAP}$ then we can built from it a projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ with $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})={\\mathcal{K}}$. An age ${\\mathcal{K}}$ that satisfies $\\mathrm{PAP}$ is called \\emph{projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} class}.\n\n\nLet ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ be a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure with $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})={\\mathcal{K}}$. We say that ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the \\emph{finite extension property} if for every ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and $f:{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $g:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ epimorphisms, there is an epimorphism $h:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ such that $f \\circ h=g$. We say that ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the \\emph{one point extension property} if the above holds when the size of $B$ is one more than the size of $A$. Notice that for any topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$, ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the one point extension property if and only if ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the finite extension property.\n\n\\begin{lm}\\label{finite extension to isomorphism lemma}\nLet ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ be two topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure of the same age ${\\mathcal{K}}$. Let ${\\boldsymbol{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and let $f:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $g:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ be two epimorphisms. If ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ have the finite extension property then there is an isomorphism $h:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{N}}$ such that $g\\circ h= f$. \n\\end{lm}\n\\begin{proof}\n \nWe will use a back and forth type of argument. For every $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ we will construct ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and epimorphisms $f_n:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to {\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$, $g_n:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to {\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$, and for every $n>0$ we will also construct an epimorphism $\\pi_{n-1}:{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\to {\\boldsymbol{A}}_{n-1}$.  At the end of the construction ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ and ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ will be proven to be isomorphic to $\\varprojlim({\\boldsymbol{A}}_n,\\pi_n)$. By using these indirect isomorphisms we will get the desired isomorphism $h$.  Let $\\{e_n: n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\}$ be an enumeration of dual tuples $m^M$ of $M$ for every $m>0$ and let $\\{e'_n: n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}\\}$ be an enumeration of dual tuples $m^N$ of $N$ for every $m>0$.\n\n$\\mathit{n=0}.$ Let ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_0={\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $f_0=f$ and  $g_0=g$.\n\n\\emph{odd} $\\mathit{n>0}$. Using Lemma \\ref{factors through lemma} we can find a structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ and an epimorphism $f_n:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ such that both $f_{n-1}$ and $e_{n-1}$ factor through $f_n$. Let $\\pi_{n-1}:{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_{n-1}$ be the epimorphism that closes the one diagram, i.e., $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ f_{n}=f_{n-1}$. Finally define $g_n:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ to be any map such that $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ g_n=g_{n-1}$. A map like this exists, since ${\\boldsymbol{N}}$ satisfies the finite extension property.   \n\n\\emph{even} $\\mathit{n>0}$. Again, using Lemma \\ref{factors through lemma} we can find a structure ${\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ and an epimorphism $g_n:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ such that both $g_{n-1}$ and $e'_{n-1}$ factor through $g_n$. Let $\\pi_{n-1}:{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_{n-1}$ be the epimorphism that closes the one diagram, i.e., $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ g_{n}=g_{n-1}$. Finally define $f_n:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}_n$ to be any map such that $\\pi_{n-1}\\circ f_n=f_{n-1}$. A map like this exists, since ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ satisfies the finite extension property.   \n\nLet now ${\\boldsymbol{B}}=\\varprojlim({\\boldsymbol{A}}_n,\\pi_n)$. The maps $\\mu:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ with $\\mu(x)=(f_0(x),f_1(x),\\ldots)$ and $\\nu:{\\boldsymbol{N}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ with $\\nu(x)=(g_0(x),g_1(x),\\ldots)$ are bijections since the families $\\{e_n\\}$ and $\\{e'_n\\}$ separate points of $M$ and $N$ in respect. It is moreover easy to see that $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are actually isomorphisms. So, the map $h:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{N}}$ with $h=\\nu^{-1}\\circ\\mu$ is also an isomorphism which by construction satisfies the desired property  $g\\circ h= f$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lm}\\label{1 point=fraisse}\nLet ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ be a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure with $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})={\\mathcal{K}}$ then the following are equivalent:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is projectively ultra-homogeneous;\n\\item ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the finite extension property;\n\\item ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ has the one point extension property.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{lm}\n\\begin{proof}\nIt is immediate that (2) and (3) are equivalent. We prove that (1) is also equivalent to (2). \n\\item[$(1)\\to(2)$] Let ${\\boldsymbol{A}},{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$ and $f:{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$, $g:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ epimorphisms. Since ${\\boldsymbol{B}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}=\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$, there is an epimorphism $j:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$. So, $f\\circ j:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ is an epimorphism, and by the projective ultra-homogeneity of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ there is $\\phi\\in{\\mathrm{Aut}}{}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ with $g\\circ\\phi=f\\circ j$. Let $h=j\\circ\\phi^{-1}$. Then $h:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ is an epimorphism such that $f \\circ h=g$. \n\\item[$(2)\\to(1)$]\nLet $f_1,f_2:{\\boldsymbol{M}}\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ be epimorphisms for some ${\\boldsymbol{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{K}}$. Then by Lemma \\ref{finite extension to isomorphism lemma}, there is $g\\in{\\mathrm{Aut}}{}({\\boldsymbol{M}})$ such that $f_1\\circ g=\\ f_2$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{theorem dual Fraisse}\nFor every projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} class ${\\mathcal{K}}$ there is a unique, up to isomorphism, projectively ultra-homogeneous topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ such that $\\mathrm{Age}({\\boldsymbol{M}})={\\mathcal{K}}$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nFirst notice that is ${\\boldsymbol{M}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{M}}_2$ share the same age and are both projectively ultra-homogeneous, by Lemma \\ref{1 point=fraisse} they have finite extension property. Let ${\\boldsymbol{A}}$ any structure in ${\\mathcal{K}}$. Since ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is the age of both ${\\boldsymbol{M}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{M}}_2$, there are epimorphisms $f_1:{\\boldsymbol{M}}_1\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $f_2:{\\boldsymbol{M}}_2\\to{\\boldsymbol{A}}$.

Solecki \\cite{SoleckiRamsey1, SoleckiRamsey2} in Ramsey theory to formalize dual Ramsey statements such as the Graham and Rothschild theorem \\cite{Graham}. S. Solecki had known for a fact that projective  {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} theory can be developed including dual predicates and he was the one who pointed out that dual structure might be needed for the proof of Theorem \\ref{theorem orbits}. An example in Chapter \\ref{direct to dual} shows that for this theorem to be true dual predicates  are actually necessary.

Our main objects of study will be spaces $K$ as above, which support both the usual model-theoretic structure as well as dual structure. To make this precise, following S. Solecki \\cite{SoleckiRamsey1,SoleckiRamsey2}, we consider the following two types of tuples. \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item In the classical model-theoretic context, a tuple of size $n>0$ in $K$ corresponds to an injection\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\n\\title{Compact spaces as quotients of projective Fra\\\"{I}ss\\'E limits}\n\n\\maketitle\n\\begin{abstract}\n We develop a theory of projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limits in the spirit of Irwin-Solecki, which moreover support a dual structure. Let $K$ be a zero-dimensional, second countable, compact space. We prove that a subgroup $G$ of ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(K)$ is closed in the compact-open topology if and only if it is the automorphism group of some dual topological {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limit ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$ on domain $K$.\nAs an application we prove that every second countable, compact space is the quotient of a projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limit ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$ with a closed equivalence relation on $K$ that is definable in ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Introduction}\nThe interplay between {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} theory and dynamics of non-Archimedean Polish groups established by the correspondence between closed subgroups of $S_\\infty$ and countable {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structures has been fruitful in many ways (see for example the survey \\cite{survey}). Taking this fact as a departure point it is natural to seek  what would the natural correspondence be for projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structures.       \n\nProjective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structures were first introduced by T. Irwin and S. Solecki in \\cite{Irwin}. These are zero-dimensional, compact, topological structures which provide a dual to the classical {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structures. However, the duality in \\cite{Irwin} was not explicitly present in the structure as such but rather in the morphisms that were used in the amalgamating process. In the same paper they used the projective limit of finite, reflexive, linear graphs in language ${\\mathcal{L}}_R=\\{R\\}$, where $R$ is a binary relation symbol, to provide a simple description of the unique hereditary, idecomposable, chainable continuum known as the pseudo-arc. This enabled them to deduce new results regarding the pseudo-arc and to show how previously known facts about it (e.g., projective universality and homogeneity) were linked at a deeper level. \n\n\nSince then, projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} constructions were used by several authors in the study of compact spaces and their homeomorphisms groups e.g., \\cite{Lelek}, \\cite{Ample}, \\cite{Large}. There is standard scheme in the analysis that appears in these papers. One starts with a second-countable compact space $Y$ where either $Y$ or the group ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$ is under investigation. Then one defines an appropriate class ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of finite model theoretic ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structures  which ``approximate'' $Y$. If this class ${\\mathcal{K}}$ satisfies the ``projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{}'' axioms \\cite{Irwin} then the projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limit ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ of ${\\mathcal{K}}$ is uniquely defined. Since the domain $M$ of ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ is a zero-dimensional space one cannot expect to equate it with $Y$ which is in general not zero-dimensional. However, in all the cases cited above the structures appearing in ${\\mathcal{K}}$ were classes of graphs perhaps with extra model theoretic structure added on top. The edge relation $R$ was part of the language ${\\mathcal{L}}$ and in the limit ${\\boldsymbol{M}}$ the relation $R^{{\\boldsymbol{M}}}$ always turned out to be an equivalence relation. The quotient ${\\boldsymbol{M}}/R^{{\\boldsymbol{M}}}$ was equal to $Y$ and the map ${\\mathrm{Aut}}({\\boldsymbol{M}})\\to{\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$ that was induced by the quotient was a continuous embedding with dense image in ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$. This allowed the study of $Y$ and ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$ via the combinatorial properties of the {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} class ${\\mathcal{K}}$.\n\nThe purpose of this note is to turn this observations to a general method. However, this is not always possible if we insist to use only classical model theoretic structure as done in \\cite{Irwin}. We rewrite the theory developed in \\cite{Irwin} dualizing it not only in the level of the morphisms but also in the level of structures i.e. we also allow dual predicates in ${\\mathcal{L}}$ which quantify over dual tuples (finite clopen partitions). We will call a topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure purely dual if ${\\mathcal{L}}$ contains only dual predicates.\n\nIn Chapter \\ref{Chapter_closed_subgroups_of_Homeo} we use a standard orbit completion argument  (i.e., we add extra predicates; one for every orbit) and equipping ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(K)$ with the compact-open topology we get the following result.      \n\n\\begin{theorem*}[\\textbf{\\ref{theorem orbits}}]\nLet $G$ be a closed subgroup of ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(K)$ where $K$ is zero-dimensional, compact, second-countable space. Then there is a purely dual projective {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} structure ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$ on domain $K$ such that ${\\mathrm{Aut}}({\\boldsymbol{K}})=G$. \n\\end{theorem*}   \n\nTheorem \\ref{theorem orbits} should be thought of as the dual of the statement that wants every closed subgroup of $S_\\infty$ to be the automorphism group of a classical {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} limit. In Chapter \\ref{direct to dual} we provide a method which allows to turn any topological ${\\mathcal{L}}$-structure into a purely dual one without losing any information. We also show  that above theorem is false if we do not allow our structures to support a dual structure. Therefore the context of dual structures is strictly more general then the context of direct structures. \n\n In Chapter \\ref{Compact spaces} we fix a special binary  relation symbol $\\mathfrak{r}$ whose interpretation will always be a reflexive and symmetric closed relation. This should paralleled with the  metric {Fra\\\"iss\\'e}{} theory where the symbol $d$ is  reserved as a signifier for the metric.  A formal relational language ${\\mathcal{L}}$ will be decorated with the subscript $\\mathfrak{r}$ whenever $\\mathfrak{r}$ belongs to ${\\mathcal{L}}$. Therefore, we always have  $\\mathfrak{r}\\in{\\mathcal{L}}_\\mathfrak{r}$ and ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\mathfrak{r}$-structures are always in particular reflexive $\\mathfrak{r}$-graphs. We say that an ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\mathfrak{r}$-structure ${\\boldsymbol{K}}$ is a pre-space if $\\mathfrak{r}^{{\\boldsymbol{K}}}$ is moreover transitive and therefore an equivalence relation.

We define $0_\\mathcal{F},1_\\mathcal{F}$ and the operations $\\wedge,\\vee,'$ as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $0_\\mathcal{F}=\\emptyset$;\n\\item $1_\\mathcal{F}=Y$;\n\\item $F_1\\wedge F_2= \\overline{\\mathrm{int}(F_1\\cap F_2)}$;\n\\item $F_1\\vee F_2= F_1\\cup F_2$;\n\\item $F'=\\overline{F^c}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe boolean algebra axioms are satisfied by the above configuration since $\\mathcal{F}$ consists of regular closed sets (see also \\cite{Halmos} for the boolean algebra of regular open sets).\n\nTo construct the boolean algebra fix first a compatible complete metric $d$ on $Y$. For every $n$ chose a finite open cover $\\{V^n_0,\\ldots,V^n_{k_n}\\}$ of $Y$ such $\\mathrm{diam}(V_i^n)<1/n$ for every $i\\in\\{0,\\ldots,k_n\\}$. Since $\\overline{V}$ is regular closed for every open $V$ we have that the collection $\\mathcal{J}=\\{F^n_i: F^n_i=\\overline{V^n_i},\\; n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},\\,\\,0\\leq i\\leq k_n \\}$ consists of regular closed sets. We define $\\mathcal{F}$ to be the least family of closed subsets of $Y$ such that:  \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $\\mathcal{J}\\subset\\mathcal{F}$;\n\\item $\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under the boolean operators $\\wedge,\\vee,'$ and\n\\item $\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under translation by elements of $H$, i.e., if $h\\in H$ and $F\\in\\mathcal{F}$ then $h(F)\\in\\mathcal{F}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nNotice that all these operations preserve regularity and since $\\mathcal{J}$ and $H$ are countable $\\mathcal{F}$ is a countable family of regular closed sets. Notice that this implies that the only $F\\in\\mathcal{F}$ that has empty interior is the empty set. The group $H$ is acting on $\\mathcal{F}$ with Boolean algebra automorphisms: for every $h\\in H$ and $F\\in\\mathcal{F}$ let\n", "index": 29, "text": "\n\\[h\\cdot F = h(F).\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"h\\cdot F=h(F).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>F</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04392.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe map $p$ is continuous surjection with $p(\\tilde{F})=F$ for every $F\\in\\mathcal{F}$.

This can be seen as follows: first notice that as a corollary of Pettis theorem we have that if $f:G\\to H$ is a Baire-measurable homomorphism between Polish groups and $f(G)$ is not meager, then $f$ is open (see for example Theorem 1.2.6 \\cite{Actions}). Now notice\nthat for $F\\in\\mathcal{F}$ the set $V(\\tilde{F},\\tilde{F})$ is open in ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(K)$ but the set  $V(F,F)$ is rarely open in ${\\mathrm{Homeo}}(Y)$ (except if $Y$ is zero-dimensional or it has very few homeomorphisms). Therefore $T$ will fail in general to be an open map. \n\n\n\\begin{bibdiv}\n\\begin{biblist}\n\n\n\\bib{Lelek}{article}\n{\nauthor = {Barto\\v{s}ov\\'{a}, Dana}\nauthor = {Kwiatkowska, Aleksandra}\ntitle = {Lelek fan from a projective Fraisse limit }\ndate = {2013}\njournal = {arXiv:1312.7514v1}\npages = {1-22}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\\bib{Actions}{book}\n{\n  title = {The descriptive set theory of Polish group actions}\n  author = {Becker, Howard}\n  author = {Kechris, S.
