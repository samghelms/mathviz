A rich discovery phase space has been revealed through\nsynoptic experiments such as the Fermi Gamma-Ray Satellite \\citep{michelson2010}, the \nSwift Gamma-Ray Burst Alert Mission \\citep{gehrels2009}, and optical imagers such as the \nCatalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope \nRapid Response System (Pan-Starrs), and the Palomar Transient Factory \\citep[PTF;][]{kasliwal2012}.\n\n\n\nA similar science yield likely awaits centimeter radio surveys. In\nTable~\\ref{tab:transients_summary} we give a summary of known\nextragalactic and Galactic slow transients (timescale $>$1s) at GHz\nfrequencies \\citep[see also][]{murphy2013,lazio2014}. These\nknown sources highlight that radio observations trace high energy\nparticles; arise in locations of high magnetic field; and probe the\ninteraction of fast outflows with the surrounding medium. They are\ncomplementary to optical and high energies in that they are not\naffected by extinction and the emission from fast outflows is often\nnot as narrowly beamed; providing reliable calorimetry and the true\nrates of cosmic explosions. \n\nIn recognition of these discovery opportunities, a new generation of centimeter wavelength facilities\nhave been built or are underway. These include the Karl G. Jansky Array \\citep[Jansky\nVLA;][]{perley2011}, ASKAP \\citep{johnston2008}, MeerKAT \\citep{booth2012}, and Apertif/WSRT \\citep{oosterloo2010}.\nThe upgraded Jansky VLA is the first operational interferometer with the survey speed to routinely \ndetect the extragalactic explosive population with modest time allocation. \nUnlike the legacy VLA, the Jansky VLA possesses frequency agility essential to characterize the broadband radio spectra of detected transients.\nIt has a much improved snapshot multi-frequency UV coverage; imaging artifacts and contamination by sidelobes \\citep{bower2007,frail2012} are no longer major impediments in transient search.\nFurthermore, unlike the SKA pathfinders, the Jansky VLA has the spatial resolution to allow the accurate localization within a host \ngalaxy (nuclear vs non-nuclear) necessary to rule out the AGN activity that dominates the extragalactic transient and variable population.\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\scriptsize\n\\centering\n\\caption{Summary of Slow Radio Transient Phenomena at 1--6 GHz Frequencies}\n\\begin{tabular}{llllllllll} \n\\hline \\hline\nNo  & Object       & Variability           & Location & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Timescale}        & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Peak Luminosity}          & Rate         & Ref.  \\\\\n\\cline{5-6}\\cline{7-8}\n    &              & Process               &             & Radio            & Optical           & Radio                   & Optical         & ($>$0.3 mJy) & \\\\\n    &              &                       &             &                  &                   & (erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$)& (erg s$^{-1}$)  & (deg$^{-2}$) & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{10}{c}{Extragalactic}\\\\\n\\hline\n1   & AGN          & a) Quiescent          & Nuclear     & years -- decades & years             & 10$^{27}$--10$^{34}$& 10$^{42}$--10$^{47}$& 0.6        &  1--7   \\\\ \n    &              & b) Shock-in-jet       & ''          & days -- years    & ---               & 10$^{27}$--10$^{34}$& ---                 & 1.25       &  6--10  \\\\% outbursts may last for years\n    &              & c) ISS                & ''          & minutes -- days  & ---               & ---                 & ---                 & 60         &  11--13 \\\\\n    &              & d) ESE                & ''          & months           & ---               & ---                 & ---                 & 0.001      &  14--15 \\\\\n    &              & e) Jet-precession     & ''          & years            & ---               & ---                 & ---                 & unknown    &  16--17 \\\\\n2   & SN-II/Ib/c   & Shocked CSM           & Traces SF   & months -- decades& days -- months    & 10$^{25}$--10$^{29}$& 10$^{41}$--10$^{43}$& 0.04 (II), &  18--23\\\\\n    &              &                       &             &                  &                   &                     &                     & 6$\\times$10$^{-6}$ (Ib/c) & \\\\\n3   & SN-Ia        & Shocked CSM           & Non-nuclear & days -- weeks    & days -- months    & $\\lesssim$10$^{23}$ & 10$^{39}$--10$^{43}$& $<$10$^{-5}$       & 23--28\\\\% http://iopscience.iop.org/1009-9271/1/3/257/pdf/1009-9271_1_3_257.pdf, http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/735/2/L35, this work for optical\n4   & Long-GRB     & Shocked CSM / Jet     & Traces SF   & days -- years    & days -- months    & 10$^{29}$--10$^{31}$& 10$^{43}$--10$^{47}$& 6$\\times$10$^{-5}$ & 29   \\\\\n    & OA           & Shocked CSM           & Traces SF   & weeks -- years   & days?

While the rates of these events are dominated by AGN, they could very well affect any class of compact sources such as pulsars.\n(6) Orphan afterglows (OAs) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers refer to the orphan counterparts of beamed long- and short-GRBs respectively.\n(7) TDE rates assume Swift J1644+57-like events. The deg$^{-2}$ rates quoted here for on- and off-axis TDEs have been calculated using the (logarithmic) mean of the Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ rate \nfrom \\cite{metzger2009} and that implied by the two on-axis TDEs discovered till date: Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05 \\citep{zauderer2011,cenko2012}. }\n\\label{tab:transients_summary}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\nTo date, there have been rather few radio surveys dedicated to slow\nvariables and transients\\footnote{see http://www.tauceti.caltech.edu/kunal/radio-transient-surveys/index.html }, \nand they all have a number of limitations. The majority of these\nsurveys were single, multi-epoch interferometric pointings with a\nlimited field of view and as a result the number of variables and\ntransients is low \\citep[e.g.][]{carilli2003,mooley2013}. Existing wide-area\nsurveys are either based on archival data or the data reduction and\ncandidate source identification was carried out significantly delayed\nfrom the observing dates. This approach has drawbacks since without\nnear-real-time data reduction and multi-wavelength follow-up, the\ncandidate lists contain ambiguous transient classifications \n\\citep{thyagarajan2011,bannister2011a,bannister2011b}. \n\n\nWe note that wide field, shallow surveys are superior to narrow field, deep\nsurveys, since they have the advantage of bringing the detectable\npopulation of transients closer in distance, thus improving the\nability to find optical/infrared counterparts and to characterize host\ngalaxies and/or progenitors.  In appendix A \nwe show mathematically that wide and shallow surveys are ideal for radio\ntransient searches.\n\n\n\nIn the light of these factors and to address some of the limitations of past surveys, we have commenced a multi-year program, \nthe Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), to search for slow radio transients with the Jansky VLA at 3 GHz in the \nSloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 region. \nThe CNSS is a dedicated transient survey carried out in five epochs (cadence of days, months and years) over the \nentire $\\sim$270 deg$^2$ of Stripe 82, with a uniform single-epoch rms noise of $\\sim$80 $\\mu$Jy and a spatial \nresolution of $\\sim$3\\arcsec.\n\nIn this paper we present the CNSS pilot survey, a sub-mJy Jansky VLA survey at 3 GHz in 50 deg$^2$ of Stripe 82.\nThis is a prototype survey to demonstrate the fast imaging capabilities of the VLA, and to develop \nnear real-time data processing, source identification, and transient search. \nAnother unique aspect of this radio survey is that it was undertaken with a\ncontemporaneous high-cadence optical survey with the PTF so that a \ndirect comparison could be made of the dynamic radio and optical skies.\nTechnical details of the radio and the optical surveys are given in \\S\\ref{sec:survey}.\nThe calibration, RFI flagging, imaging and source cataloging of the Jansky VLA data carried out in \nnear-real-time as well as during the final careful processing is described in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing}.\n\\S\\ref{sec:optical_processing} details the optical data processing for the

\nindependently of the radio survey.\nA summary of the results from our joint radio-optical experiment and their implications are discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:summary}.\n\n\n\\section{The Survey}\\label{sec:survey}\n\n\\subsection{Radio Observations}\\label{sec:survey:radio_observations}\n\nThe Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS) was designed to: \n1) logarithmically sample timescales roughly between one week and one year, \n2) have a high survey speed (which is a function of the bandwidth and the antenna system temperature), \n3) have a relatively high angular resolution to facilitate a precise location of transients, \n4) be carried out in a part of the sky where ample multi-wavelength archival data were available so as to enable the identification of host galaxies or progenitors of the radio transients, \n5) find non-thermal transients relatively early-on in their evolution, and \n6) be wide and sensitive enough to potentially detect or place strong constraints on binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and orphan long-duration gamma-ray burst afterglows (OAs),\n\nFor the pilot survey, we chose a $\\sim$50 deg$^2$ region in SDSS Stripe 82 with similar characteristics.\nThe region had to satisfy other scheduling constraints in the radio and optical, so we specifically chose the region bounded in right \nascension by 329.127\\arcdeg and 353.158\\arcdeg, and in declination by -1.132\\arcdeg and +1.167\\arcdeg, approximately.\nObservations were carried out across four epochs with the Jansky VLA in B array configuration and S-band was chosen to maximize survey speed.\nTo maximize the continuum imaging sensitivity, the observing setup chosen was: Wideband Interferometric Digital Architecture (WIDAR) correlator with 16 spectral windows, \n64 2-MHz-wide channels each to get 2 GHz of total bandwidth centered on 3.0 GHz, and 1-sec integrations.\n\nThe first three epochs were observed under the project code 12A-371 between Jul--Aug 2012.\nDue to telescope scheduling constraints, each of these epochs was divided into two nights of observing of 7 hours each.\nAll the six 7-hour observing blocks were centered on 23h local sidereal time (LST).\nWe refer to the three epochs as E1/2/3 and the regions observed on the two nights of the first epoch as R1 and R2 respectively.\n{\\it Observations were carried out at the same LST in the three epochs in order to minimize systematic effects associated with sidelobes and beam squint.}\nEach of the regions, R1 and R2, was divided into 485 pointings arranged in a hexagonal mosaic pattern (Figure~\\ref{fig:radio_obs_setup}), \noptimized using the {\\it makeschedule} task in CASA written by Andreas Brunthaler.\nIn order to maximize the volume probed by our survey, we compromised on uniform-sensitivity coverage, placing neighboring pointings at $\\geqslant$15\\arcmin.\nThe mosaic is therefore not precisely hexagonal close packed\\footnote{Although epochs E1--E3 do not have uniform sensitivity across the survey region, the final CNSS survey is designed to have uniform RMS noise.}. \nNearest neighbors having the same declination are separated by 15\\arcmin, and those having offset in declination are $\\sqrt{15\\arcmin^2+7.5\\arcmin^2}=16.8\\arcmin$ apart.\nDuring each night of observing, one 39-second snapshot observation was obtained at each of the 485 target pointings.\nJ2212+0152 and J2323-0317 were chosen as the phase calibrators for the two regions respectively, and 3C48 as the flux and bandpass calibrator.\nThe phase calibrator was observed every 15 minutes.\nA summary of the first three observing epochs is given in

are quite large, and this poses a computational challenge in terms of rapid data processing \nneeded for triggered transient follow-up.\nThe size of each of our observation blocks (listed in Table~\\ref{tab:radio_observations}) is about 250 GB, and to enable near-real-time data processing, \ndedicated computational hardware was set in place at the NRAO in Socorro.\nIn general, the calibration, source cataloging and transient search was carried out over a single cluster node at Socorro, and the imaging was distributed across multiple (up to six) cluster nodes.\nAll this processing was done using a custom-developed, semi-automated AIPSLite/Python-based pipeline developed at Caltech \\citep[e.g.][]{bourke2014}.\nDetails of the near-real-time data processing are given in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:NRT}.\n\nAfter the completion of all observing epochs, a more detailed calibration and imaging of the raw data was carried out using CASA 4.1\\footnote{http://casa.nrao.edu/. \nAlthough calibration and imaging was seen to be faster in AIPSLite than in CASA, the latter was preferred due to the user-friendliness of plotting the data \nand the availability of wide-band wide-field imaging algorithms. \nThrough our tests, no significant difference is seen in the quality of data calibrated using either software.} (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final}).\n\n\\subsection{Near-Real-Time Processing}\\label{sec:radio_processing:NRT}\n\nFor each observing block, the data were downloaded onto the NRAO lustre file system (typical download time of 20 min) \nimmediately after they appeared on the VLA archive (only several minutes lag after the completion of the observations).\nNext, the raw data was calibrated on a single cluster node using AIPS/Obit tasks accessed via ObitTalk, ParselTongue and AIPSLite.\nThe calibration part of the pipeline follows the procedures outlined in Chapter E of the AIPS Cookbook.\nThe first three spectral windows (SPWs), spanning 2.00--2.38 GHz in frequency, and as well as the last three SPWs, spanning 3.62--4.00 GHz, were completely flagged.\nCalibration as per the prescription is carried out on a per-SPW basis and almost always failed for many of these SPWs.\nThis was caused by strong satellite-induced RFI in these bands which was not automatically removed by RFLAG.\nTherefore, to speedup the data processing and meet the goal of rapid follow-up, we flagged these SPWs.\nFor the fourth epoch, we recognized that the first SPW was recoverable with minor manual flagging and the entire SPW was not flagged.\n\nPost-calibration imaging was carried out somewhat differently for the first three epochs and the fourth epoch, since different observing modes were used.\nFor the first three epochs, the derived calibration was applied to each pointing during imaging.\nThe imaging stage of the pipeline was distributed over 16 cores across two cluster nodes such that, at any point in time, 16 pointings were being imaged simultaneously using the AIPS task IMAGR.\nCLEANing was done with 800 iterations per pointing and natural weighting.\nFor each pointing, the CLEANed $4096\\times4096$ pix$^2$, 0.58 \\arcsec pix$^{-1}$ images, uncorrected for the primary beam to get a uniform rms noise across the image, were \nsub-imaged to $2048\\times2048$ pix$^2$ using the AIPS task SUBIM.\nAfter the imaging of each observing block, the 485 single-pointing sub-images were copied over to a local machine at Caltech, where the source cataloging and transient detection part of the pipeline was run.\nThe thermal noise in each pointing is expected to be $\\sim$50~$\\mu$Jy, and our automated flagging produced data which is within 10\\% of this value, except for E1 where larger RFI as present.\nFor source-finding, the use of the {\\it sfind} algorithm from MIRIAD was motivated by the short runtime and reasonable completeness and reliability of catalogs \\citep{huynh2012,hancock2012,mooley2013}.\nWe cataloged all sources above the 5$\\sigma$ threshold and used these for the variability and transient search described in detail in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients:nrt}.\n\nThe imaging for the fourth epoch was carried out with the CASA task {\\it clean} after the calibrated data from AIPSLite were exported into UVFITS format and then imported into CASA as measurement sets.\nBefore the imaging step, we clipped the visibility amplitudes of all SPWs at a threshold determined by the SPW with the least RFI.\nFor each SPW, a RFI-proxy value was calculated as the sum of the mean and three times the standard deviation of the scalar-averaged amplitude.\nThe clipping amplitude was then chosen to be the least of the RFI-proxy values.\nWe carried out tests on several pointings to ensure that this clipping threshold was robust and did not alter the flux densities and spectral indices of sources.\nAfter the clipping of visibility amplitudes, all 4-second-long scans, which have unique phase centers, were imaged individually.\nImaging was distributed over 60 cores across five cluster nodes such that, at any given time, 60 pointings were being imaged simultaneously using the CASA task {\\it clean}.\nCLEANing was done with 500 iterations per scan and natural weighting with a {\\it cyclefactor}\\footnote{The {\\it cyclefactor} parameter determines the \nnumber of minor cycles carried out between successive major clean cycles. \nA large {\\it cyclefactor} value thus minimizes the confusion between sidelobes and true sources during minor cycles that may sometimes result in \nstrong line or spike-shaped imaging artifacts.} of 4.5 chosen to mitigate imaging artifacts.\nA common 3\\arcsec~circular restoring beam was chosen to facilitate the co-addition of scans in the image plane.\n$2800\\times2800$ pix$^2$, 0.75\\arcsec~pix$^{-1}$ images, uncorrected for the primary beam, were produced and then sub-imaged to $1700\\times1700$ pix$^2$ using the image analysis toolkit in CASA.\n1700 pixels corresponds to 20\\% of the primary beam at 3 GHz.\nThe CASA images were exported to FITS format and combined into a mosaic using the AIPS task {\\it FLATN} after correcting for the primary beam.\nThe mean rms noise is $\\sim$95 $\\mu$Jy while the theoretically expected value is 80 $\\mu$Jy.\nThe increased rms noise is likely due to low-level RFI and joint-deconvolution not being incorporated during the CLEANing process.\nSources beyond 5$\\sigma$ were found using RMSD and SAD tasks in AIPS to get reasonably complete and reliable catalogs \\citep{mooley2013}.\nOnce all the E4 observations were complete, the images were combined using the AIPS task {\\it COMB} to make a final E4 mosaic.\nThis mosaic was used to carry out a deeper variability and transient search with respect to epoch E2, the FIRST survey, and the VLA-Stripe 82 survey (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients}).\n\nSince computing time required for the various stages of data processing and transient search are critical for any near-real-time search, we briefly describe this aspect here.\nData I/O is the rate-determining factor in our near-real-time data processing. \nAs a result, the processing time is a strong function of the percentage of free disk space on the NRAO lustre file system at Socorro which hosted the data-processing for our survey.\nFor the first three epochs, the lustre had 75\\% free disk space, and the calibration, imaging, cataloging and transient search for each observing \nblock, covering 25 deg$^2$ over 485 pointings or scans and amounting to 250 GB of visibility data, required about 4.5 hours, 0.5 hours, 0.5 hours, and 0.5 hours respectively. \nThus, we were able to detect transient candidates within six hours from the completion of observations.\nThis fast turnaround allowed same-night triggering of optical follow-up and also rapid broadband radio follow-up, which are crucial for \nunderstanding transients that evolve on relatively short timescales. \n\nFor the fourth epoch, the lustre had 15--20\\% free disk space and imaging problem was much more lengthy owing to the 2025 scans to be imaged.\n\nThe calibration and imaging for each observing block within E4, which had 250 GB of visibility data and covered a 22.5 deg$^2$ area on the sky, required 12 hours and 3 hours respectively, \nwhile the transient search was completed in 1 hour.\n\n\n\\subsection{Final Processing}\\label{sec:radio_processing:final}\n\nDuring the near-real-time processing, the data editing and source identification (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:NRT}) was not done optimally in order to enable rapid follow-up of \ninteresting radio transient candidates.\nAlso, some problems with a small subset of the data were discovered after the near-real-time processing.\nSpecifically, 1) the automated RFI algorithm and manual flagging likely excised both\nterrestrial interference and valid astronomical data, 2) the gain\ncalibration for several pointings was affected by strong satellite signals,\nand 3) a subset the initial calibrated data suffered from a systematic phase distortion (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:imaging}).\n\n\nThus, following the completion of the observing epochs E1, E2 and E3, we carried out a more detailed processing of the raw data using CASA.\nEpoch E4 was not subjected to final detailed processing; calibrated data from the near-real-time processing was directly used for analysis.\n\n\\subsubsection{Calibration}\\label{sec:radio_processing:final:calibration}\nThe final calibration was carried out using the NRAO calibration pipeline (pipeline version 1.2.0 implemented in CASA 4.1), \nmodified to accommodate manual flagging and additional calibration diagnostic plots, and to bypass Hanning smoothing.\nThe calibration was done with two iterative runs of the pipeline.\nDiagnostic plots for the flux and gain calibrators (plots of the gain calibration tables and calibrated phases and amplitudes) from the initial run were used to determine visibilities \nwith incorrect amplitude and/or phase calibration or bad calibrator data.\nAntenna-, baseline-, correlation-, SPW-, and time-based manual flagging of the flux and gain calibrators was incorporated in the second run to remove these visibilities.\nEspecially, five SPWs having frequencies between 2.12--2.38 GHz and 3.62--4.00 GHz, for which the amplitude and phase calibration failed in most instances, were manually flagged before calibration.\nAfter the second iteration of the NRAO calibration pipeline followed by imaging, two issues persisted: \n1) the amplitude gain solutions were not stable as a function of time likely due to RFI-induced non-linearities in the signal chain (see \\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:rfi}), and \n2) Y-shaped imaging artifact in the first 95 scans of the 24Jul2012 epoch, indicating bad raw phase data for the gain calibrator (see \\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:imaging}).\n\n\\subsubsection{RFI}\\label{sec:radio_processing:final:rfi}\nSince Stripe 82 is close to the Clarke belt, radio observations are prone to severe RFI from satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GSO) orbits.\n\nThe RFI in the frequency range 3.62--4.00 GHz is low-level in amplitude, but it distorts the phase information quite significantly.\nThose data that are irreparably affected are flagged for our final reduction.\nGSO satellites seen by the Jansky VLA have not been individually characterized in terms of downlink frequencies and polarizations, and our target data could potentially be affected. \n\nThe derived calibration also shows instability in the form of sporadically varying amplitude gains from the gain calibrator.\nThis effect is pronounced in those gain calibrator scans that are severely affected by RFI.\nIn epochs E1, E2 and E3, where the observations were carried out over the same LST range (\\S\\ref{sec:survey:radio_observations}), the aberration in gain is reproducible within a specific LST range.\nThis suggests that the aberrant amplitude gains occur at a particular range of azimuth: between 124\\arcdeg~and 255\\arcdeg~for region R1 (J2212+0152 used as gain calibrator) and \nbetween 135\\arcdeg~and 220\\arcdeg~for region R2 (gain calibrator J2323-0317).\nThe scans of the southern calibrator, J2323-0317, are more severely affected than those of J2212+0152 due to the proximity of the former to the Clarke belt.\nThe upper panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:GainAmp}~ shows the normalized gain amplitudes for J2323-0317 and the normalized rms noise in the target pointings as a function of the observing scan number (as a proxy for time).\nIt is evident that the amplitude gains are correlated with the rms noise of the target pointings, suggestive of anomalous gain values.\nOur analysis of the calibrated data is complicated by the fact that, although the RFI is localized to typically a single SPW, amplitude \ngains in SPWs that are free from RFI are also significantly affected (irrespective of the baseband in which the RFI is present; lower panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:GainAmp}).\nWe refer to this as ``gain compression''.\nThe ``compression'' signifies that the amplitude gain values are reduced with respect to their true values and result in increased rms noise in the target fields.\nInitial assessment attributes the aberrant gains with non-linearities in the amplification stage in the analog signal chain somewhere upstream from the \ncorrelator caused by the the high power of the satellite signals.\nHowever, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly tested.\n\nWe devised a fix for the gain compression in the gain calibrator scans by altering the amplitude gain calibration table generated by the NRAO calibration pipeline.\nTowards the end of each epoch there is a time interval lasting several minutes where the gains are relatively stable and close to unity (to within a few percent).\nWe therefore applied constant amplitude gains of unity for the duration of each epoch, and for all epochs.\nWith this correction, the rms noise values for epochs E1, E2 and E3 are more stable with time and are usually within 10\\% of the thermal noise.\nThe spread in the baseline-based amplitude gains in the stable time duration is $<$0.05, and hence we estimate that this correction will affect the true amplitudes of the target sources by $<$5\\%.\n{\\it Given that gain calibrators in the vicinity of the Clarke belt are susceptible to gain compression, we have avoided using such gain calibrators for the final CNSS survey.}\nAccordingly, there is no indication of severe gain compression in the gain calibrator scans from epoch E4.\nWhile the gain compression in the gain calibrator scans has a relatively straightforward workaround, the effect of gain compression on the target pointings, if present, is much more challenging to deduce.\nWe investigate the possible issue of gain compression in target fields in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients}.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3in]{images/Plot_spw9day56122_gain.png}\n\\includegraphics[width=3in]{images/gain_compression_ver2.png}\n\\caption{Demonstration

by almost 10\\% (the latter is assumed to have the true or expected gain).}\n\\label{fig:GainAmp}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Imaging}\\label{sec:radio_processing:final:imaging}\nAfter calibration of the data using the NRAO pipeline, we clipped the visibility amplitudes of all SPWs in the manner described in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:NRT}.\nWe then derived and applied a single-round phase-only self calibration solution to every pointing containing a source brighter than 10 mJy in the near-real-time image.\nThe model for the self calibration was constructed by making a preliminary image with 100 clean iterations using the CASA task {\\it clean}.\nSelf calibration solutions were allowed to break at spectral window and scan boundaries.\nEach self calibrated pointing was then imaged by cleaning within the 1\\% power point of the primary beam of the lowest frequency, 2.0 GHz, \nusing natural weighting in the {\\it clean} task in CASA, choosing a \ncellsize of 0.6\\arcsec, and 500 clean iterations to minimize clean bias. \n\n\n\nA single Taylor term ($nterms=1$) was used, which was sufficient to achieve the desired dynamic range $\\sim10^3$.\nWe also chose a {\\it cyclefactor} of 4.5 to minimize imaging arifacts.\n\nBasic quality checks were made by visually inspecting the images for each pointing.\nUsing Briggs weighting with a {\\it robust} parameter of zero, we re-imaged those pointings in which imaging artifacts persisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the 4800$\\times$4800 pix$^2$ cleaned single-pointing images at 2.8 GHz were then sub-imaged to 2400$\\times$2400 pix$^2$.\n2400 pixels corresponds to 42\\%, 15\\% and 1\\% of the power point of the primary beam at 2.0 GHz, 2.8 GHz and 3.63 GHz respectively (Figure~\\ref{fig:PB}).\nThe median synthesized beam obtained for all three epochs is $3.1\\arcsec\\times2.0\\arcsec$, except for E1R1, where the median synthesized beam size is $3.8\\arcsec\\times2.1\\arcsec$ likely due to increased RFI.\n\n\nThe mean rms noise per epoch is given in Table~\\ref{tab:radio_observations}.\nThe cumulative plot for rms noise (flat sky) as a function of survey area is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:sensitivity}.\nFor epochs E2 and E3, more than 90\\% of the survey area has rms noise lower than 105 $\\mu$Jy, while for E4 it is better than 75 $\\mu$Jy.\nEpoch E1, having rms noise of 130 $\\mu$Jy or better over 90\\% of the survey area, is severely affected by low-level RFI compared to other epochs.\nNote that, for the first three epochs, neighboring pointings are quite far apart and do not contribute significantly to the sensitivity of the overlap region.\nHence, single pointings were imaged separately and treated independently during the source finding step.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{images/PBResponse.pdf}\n\\caption{The primary beam response at the lowest (blue dashed line), highest (green dot-dashed) and reference (solid red) frequencies.}\n\\label{fig:PB}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{images/sensitivity.pdf}\n\\caption{The survey area having the rms noise (flat sky) less than or equal to the given sensitivity.}\n\\label{fig:sensitivity}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFor the 24Aug2012 (epoch E3, region R1) epoch, the first 1.5 hours of observations have been affected by a systematic phase distortion.\nAbout 80 target pointings and six phase calibrator (J2212+0152) scans have been thus affected.\nWhen the calibrated data is imaged, the phase distortion manifests as a three-pronged artifact such that \npoint sources appear extended along three axes characteristic of the Y-shape of the VLA configuration (left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:Y}).\nWe looked at the phase gain solutions per antenna derived from one of the affected phase calibrator scans and plotted it as a function of x- and \ny-positions (east-west and north-south) of the respective antennas in the array.\nThe center of the array has higher gain phase (degrees) than the arms, and along the arms, it decreases monotonically, in general.\nThis is equivalent to a bowl-shaped or lenticular phase screen above the array.\nThe exact cause of the phase distortion is unknown, but it may arise due to RFI, unfavorable weather, the ionosphere, or some internal error in the antenna phase recording.\nWhile the true phases can be restored through self calibration, not all our affected pointings have bright sources to facilitate this. \nTherefore, for the affected pointings, we used the corresponding phases and amplitudes from the 18Jul2012 (epoch E2, region R1) observations as a model for self calibration. \nThe image of a bright source after such a calibration is applied, is shown in the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:Y}.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.68in]{images/YArtifact_1.png}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.68in]{images/YArtifact_2.png}\n\\caption{The

was used to create an rms image for each individual pointing for epochs E1, E2 and E3, and the resulting background images were supplied as input to SAD.\nSource-finding was then carried out with SAD to find sources with SNR$>$5.\nFor sources present in adjacent pointings, only the catalog entries were retained in which the sources are closest to their respective pointing centers.\nThus, the cataloged sources are within 9\\arcmin~(within 40\\% of the 2.8 GHz primary beam) from their nearest pointing centers.\nApproximately 10$^9$ synthesized beams span the images from our 4-epoch survey, from which we expect 500, 2, and $<$1 noise peaks above 5$\\sigma$, 6$\\sigma$, and 7$\\sigma$ respectively.\nWhile we used 5$\\sigma$ source catalogs for the near-real-time transient search, we followed the recommendations of \\cite{frail2012}, to filter our new source catalogs and keep only SNR$>$7 sources \nduring the final processing.\nWith the goal of variable and transient search in mind, we further retained only probable point sources\\footnote{Sources having the \nratio of their integrated flux densities to peak flux densities less than 1.5 were selected as probable point sources.\nDuring this step of filtering the source catalogs, we also rejected probable false positives associated with imaging artifacts in the vicinity of bright sources. \nSources in the catalog that were elongated by a factor of 2.5 larger than the ratio of the major axis to minor axis of the convolved beam were rejected. \nAll cataloged objects within 1.6\\arcmin~of $>$10 mJy sources were rejected, retaining the $>$10 mJy sources themselves.\nIn order to filter out false positives with flux densities greater than 10 mJy, all cataloged objects within 1.6\\arcmin~of $>$50 mJy sources were rejected, retaining the $>$50 mJy sources themselves.\nThis reduces our transient search area by less than one square degree, but gets rid of almost most false positives.\nSome sidelobes identified as such by eye, were also rejected from the source catalogs.\nThis false positive rejection step eliminates 438 objects out of 4205 unique objects in our list of probable point sources.\nAdditional 35 sources were discarded as being resolved after manual inspection of a subset of images from our survey.}.\n\n\n\nThe resulting catalogs from each epoch were then merged into a single point-source catalog (PSC).\n\nIn many cases, it was found that the peak flux densities of sources in the PSC, as reported in the original SAD catalogs, was not in agreement with the peak \nflux densities as seen in the images.\nSince accurate peak flux densities are critical for any variability and transient search, we replaced the SAD peak flux density values for all objects in the PSC \nwith the corresponding peak pixel values in the single-epoch images.\nThe uncertainties in the peak flux densities of sources in the PSC were taken directly from their corresponding counterparts in the SAD catalogs or \nby measuring the image rms noise in the vicinity of the sources.\nThe flux densities of all sources in the PSC and their associated uncertainties were corrected for the primary beam at 2.8 GHz using parameters from the PBCOR task in AIPS.\nThe PSC thus contains peak flux densities and the uncertainties of 3652 point sources having SNR$>$7 in any one of the four epochs.\nThe histogram in the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:S_hist} shows the distribution of flux densities from epoch E2 of sources in the PSC.\nWe used this PSC for our variability and transient search (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients}).\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/S_hist.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\it Left}: Histograms of the peak flux densities in

For the Gaussian distribution, 4$\\sigma$ corresponds to a probability of about\n1/16,000, while the number of measurements in our variability analysis (few thousand point sources multiplied by four epochs) is about 15,000. \nFor our variability analysis we could have used the $\\chi^2$ statistic as previous studies have done \\citep[e.g.][]{ofek2011,mooley2013}, but \nfor cases where the number of degrees of freedom are small, Student's t is preferred.\nSee also chapter 4 and appendix C of \\cite{bevington2003}. }, i.e. if,\n\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  V_s = \\Big|\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\sigma}\\Big| \\geqslant 4.3\n\\label{eqn:var_2epoch}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"V_{s}=\\Big{|}\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\sigma}\\Big{|}\\geqslant 4.3\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">|</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mi>\u03c3</mi></mfrac><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">|</mo></mrow><mo>\u2a7e</mo><mn>4.3</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01693.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nwhere $\\overline{S}$ is the mean of the flux densities, $S_1\\pm\\sigma_1$ and $S_2\\pm\\sigma_2$, in the two epochs being compared.\nWe note that the definition of modulation index used here is proportional to the one used by \\cite{mooley2013}, but larger by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe modulation index is related to the fractional variability, $f_{\\rm var}$, by the following equation.\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 60428, "prevtext": "\n\nThe choice of the confidence interval was motivated by the need for high reliability of the variable sources found, while making a possible compromise on the completeness.\nThis issue of completeness and reliability is taken into account while calculating the rates of variable sources in \\S\\ref{sec:summary:variability}.\nFor the two-epoch comparison of variables selected using equation~\\ref{eqn:var_2epoch}, we use the modulation index as the measure of variability.\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  m = \\frac{\\Delta S}{\\overline{S}}\n\\label{eqn:modidex}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"m=\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\overline{S}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>S</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01693.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\n\\subsection{Near-Real-Time Search}\\label{sec:radio_transients:nrt}\n\nInitially, during the near-real-time transient and variability search, we used variability statistic $V_s$ (equation~\\ref{eqn:var_2epoch}), and further \nselected sources with fractional variability larger than 50\\%.\nAs soon as a new epoch was observed, it was compared with all previous epochs.\nAmong $\\sim$6000 sources in our near-real-time 5$\\sigma$ single-epoch catalogs, we found $\\sim$500 to be variables.\nWe note here, beforehand, that following the final data processing, we found that most of these candidates were falsely identified \nas variable due the RFI-induced amplitude calibration problem identified in \\S~\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:rfi}.\n\n \nThe shortlist of follow-up candidates was generated from the near-real-time catalogs.\n\n\n\nFor further filtering of variable candidates, we used multi-wavelength archival data and PTF, and inspected the radio image cutouts by eye.\nIt turned out that the PTF data were not very useful for this purpose.\nAs we show in \\S\\ref{sec:optical_properties}, there is little overlap between variable radio sources and sources that vary in the optical, and almost all these jointly \nvariable sources are AGN.\nOptical spectra from the SDSS BOSS program \\citep{dawson2013} were especially useful in filtering our list of candidates. \nIn general, for those radio transients having BOSS spectra, we filtered out sources showing AGN features in their optical spectra. \nWISE colors were also used to eliminate possible AGN.\nPreference was given to sources that are undetected in archival radio data.\n\nWe also compared our catalogs with those from past surveys at 1.4 GHz, viz. FIRST \\citep{white1997} and VLA-Stripe 82 \\citep{hodge2011}, and\nselected $\\sim$10 point sources with implied spectral indices more than 2.5 or less than -2.5 between 3 GHz and 1.4 GHz.\nThis was motivated by the search for transients such as supernovae and tidal disruption events \\citep[Swift J1644+57-like; ][]{zauderer2011,zauderer2013} which evolve on a timescale of years. \nHowever, most of these candidates turned out to be either GPS sources or flaring AGN (see below).\n\nOur final list of candidates for follow-up consisted of 20 objects that displayed a factor of two or more fractional variability between any two epochs, or were \nnew bright sources compared with previous surveys at 1.4 GHz. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Search for Variables and Transients after Final Data Processing}\\label{sec:radio_transients:final}\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter correcting for the aberrant complex gains during the final data processing (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final}), we carried out \na careful search for variables and transients bearing in mind the possibility of gain compression (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:rfi}) in the target fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain consistency during our variability and transient search, we only compared epochs E1, E3, and E4 with epoch E2 in order to probe variability on \ntimescales of one month, one week, and 1.5 years respectively.\nNote that among the first three epochs, E2 was the least affected by RFI.\n\nFor each source in the PSC, we calculated the statistical quantity $V_s$ using equation~\\ref{eqn:var_2epoch}.\nThere appeared to be a small deviation of this statistic from the expected distribution (Student's t distribution).\nThis may be a result of low-level gain compression in the target fields.\nAlthough the epoch-to-epoch flux densities are not significantly discrepant, we addressed this issue by applying small, relative, corrections to the ratios \nof and the differences in the flux densities of sources between the two epochs being compared.\n\nFor the one-week and one-month comparison, we made multiplicative corrections of 2\\%$\\pm$3\\% (median value with standard deviation) to the ratios of flux densities and \nadditive corrections of 20 $\\mu$Jy $\\pm$ 50 $\\mu$Jy to the differences in the flux densities of sources in the PSC.\nThese corrections were derived for the two-epoch comparisons by plotting the ratios and differences of flux densities of sources as a function of time of observation \nand demanding the ratios and differences to be centered at unity and zero respectively.\n\n\nDuring the comparison between epochs E4 and E2, we found it necessary to make two independent sets of corrections to the ratios of flux densities.\nIn the first set, multiplicative corrections of 3\\%$\\pm$4\\% were seen to be correlated with the declination of the sources.\nThis discrepancy of flux densities in epoch E4 with respect to epoch E2 is a result of the the OTF survey design and the near-real-time imaging process, and \nwill be described in detail in CNSS Paper II.\nIn short, during the OTF observations carried out for epoch E4, the primary beam moved by 4\\arcmin~within every scan; this was not accounted for in the imaging step.\n\nThe resulting fractional change in flux density of a source depends on its position in the primary beam.\nThis effect is manifested as a sinusoidal pattern when the flux density ratios are plotted as a function of source declinations.\nThe second set of corrections consist of multiplicative corrections of 4\\%$\\pm$4\\% to the ratios of flux densities and may be attributed to gain compression.\nAdditive corrections of 10 $\\mu$Jy $\\pm$ 30 $\\mu$Jy were applied to the differences in the flux densities between epochs E4 and E2.\nWith the application of these small, first-order, corrections we ensure to not over-fit the data and remove real variability in flux densities of the sources in the PSC.\n\n\nThe histograms showing the resultant distributions of the variability statistic, $V_s$, is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:varstat}.\nIt is evident that, after the corrections, $V_s$ agrees well with the Student's t distribution (however, see note on the 1.5 year distribution below).\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/varstat.pdf}\n\\caption{A histogram of the variability statistic, $V_s$, for sources in the PSC. \nAfter the application of the corrections to the flux densities mentioned in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients}, \n$V_s$ agrees with the expected distribution, Student's t.}\n\\label{fig:varstat}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nTo determine additional sources of artificial variability, we ran further intensive tests with manual flagging and imaging. \nWe found variations of up to a few percent in the flux densities of sources just by choosing different values for the input parameters to the CASA {\\it clean} task.\nSpecifically, these parameters are: cleaning iterations ({\\it niter}) and Taylor terms (nterms).\nWe also noticed variations by changing the values provided to the {\\it clipminmax} parameter in the {\\it flagdata} task.\nAdditionally, we know that the flux density absolute calibration (we used 3C48 as the flux density standard calibrator in our survey) is usually accurate \nto only 3--5\\% \\citep[e.g.][]{ofek2011,thyagarajan2011,mooley2013}.\n\nAll in all, due to gain compression and other possible causes of artificial variability mentioned above, we adopt a conservative criterion for selection of \nour variable sources: fractional variability greater than 0.3 ($|m|>0.26$).\n\n\n\n\n\nOur final variability selection criteria are $V_s\\geqslant4.3$ and $|m|>0.26$.\nThe plots of the $V_s$ versus $m$ for sources in the PSC after applying the corrections mentioned earlier in this subsection are shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:varstat_m}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=7in]{images/varstat_m.png}\n\\caption{The variability statistic, $V_s$, as a function of the modulation index, $m$, for sources in the PSC for the various timescales considered in this work.\nThe dashed red lines indicate our selection criteria for variables. \nFilled gray circles denote sources that are not variable while red circles have been selected as variables. \nThe sizes of the circles indicate the mean flux densities of the sources in the two epochs being compared.\nWe find 38, 31, and 96 variable sources on timescales of one week, one month, and 1.5 years respectively, amounting to a total of 142 variable sources.\nThe upper x-axis in each of the three panels represents the fractional variability as given by equation~\\ref{eqn:fvar}.\nSee \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients} for details.}\n\\label{fig:varstat_m}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nFor the sources in the PSC satisfying the variability selection criteria, we manually inspected the image cutouts and their fitted Gaussian \nparameters, viz. major axes ($b$), minor axes ($a$), the peak flux densities ($S_{\\rm peak}$) and the integrated flux densities ($S_{\\rm int}$), in order to ensure that they are not resolved. \nFor sources detected at a high significance level (SNR$\\gtrsim$15), we used the criteria: $S_{\\rm int}/S_{\\rm peak}\\lesssim1.1$, $b\\lesssim1.1\\times${\\tt BMAJ}, and \n$a\\lesssim1.1\\times${\\tt BMIN}, where the variables in typewriter text denote the major and minor axes of the synthesized beam. \nFor the sources detected at low significance, we relaxed the integrated-to-peak flux density ratio to 1.3--1.5.\nThis procedure for selecting unresolved is motivated by the standard techniques used for deep radio surveys \\citep[e.g. ][]{huynh2005,franzen2015}.\nWhile this approach \\citep[c.f.][]{hodge2013} errs on the conservative side, we prefer to identify real variables rather than false positives caused by resolution effects.\n\n\nWe thus find 142 variables among 3652 sources in our PSC, or, in other words, about 3.8\\% of the sample has fractional variability more than 30\\% on timescales $<$1.5 years.\nThe number of point sources varying on week, month, and 1.5 year timescales are 38, 31, and 96 respectively, or 1.0\\%, 0.8\\% and 2.6\\% respectively.\nThese sources are listed in Table~\\ref{tab:transients}.\nA glance at Figure~\\ref{fig:varstat} suggests that the variability statistic, $V_s$, comparing epochs E2 and E4 (probing variability on a timescale of 1.5 years) deviates from the \nStudent's t distribution in the tail.\nThis may be due to some calibration errors from the near-real-time processing that we have not tried correcting for, and therefore the fraction of variables on a 1.5-year timescale, 2.6\\%, \nis likely an upper limit.\nNote that the variable sources are distributed uniformly on the sky with no pattern indicative of particular region(s) of the sky being affected by calibration errors.\n\nSince our 50 deg$^2$ survey region contains rich archival data from the FIRST and VLA-Stripe 82 surveys, we extended our transient search \nto timescales of up to $\\sim$20 years.\nWe compared the 3 GHz peak flux densities of sources in the PSC with the 1.4 GHz peak flux densities from these two surveys (Figure~\\ref{fig:var_CNSS_FIRST_Hodge}).\n\nThe mean spectral index\\footnote{We define the spectral index, $\\alpha$, as $S\\propto\\nu^\\alpha$.}, $\\alpha_{\\rm mean}$, appears to be between $-0.5$ and $-1$, as expected \\citep[e.g.][]{randall2012}.\n\n\nWith the view of finding only the extreme variable and transient candidates, we searched beyond implied spectral indices of $-$1$\\pm$2.5 (i.e. less than $-3.5$ or greater than 1.5) \nwith respect to the FIRST survey, and beyond $-$0.5$\\pm$2.5 with respect to the VLA-Stripe 82 survey.\n\nThe threshold of $\\pm$2.5 in spectral index is somewhat arbitrary; it is motivated by our need for filtering out most of the sources and selecting only a few, extreme, objects.\nOur search resulted in 11 unique objects.\nTwo candidates are resolved out (closely-separated radio lobes) in our data; one candidate is identified as such due to its erroneously absent in VLA-Stripe 82 catalog (but present in the image); \nand

luminosity, the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio of 1.4$\\times$10$^{-3}$, and the spectral type all suggest that HD 214129 is an RS CVn-type binary.\n\nAccordingly, we expect the quiescent 3 GHz radio luminosity of the transient to be $L_R \\lesssim 10^{15 \\pm 1}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ \\citep[][; however, strictly speaking, \ntheir L$_X$-L$_R$ relationship is valid for 5 GHz flux density]{benz1994,gudel2002}.\nFrom epoch E4 we get the 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the quiescent 3 GHz flux density of this transient as $2.4\\times10^{15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$.\nUsing a distance of 100 pc, we can estimate the flaring radio luminosity in epoch E1 as $1.1\\times10^{16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$.\nFrom the binarity, the optical spectrum, radio and X-ray luminosities, X-ray hardness ratios from ROSAT, and the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio, we conclude that this radio transient is \na flare from an active binary system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{VTC225707-010238: Flaring

survey at the location of VTC233002-002736 is $0.34\\pm0.13$ mJy (mean epoch 1999.2).\nThis implies an order of magnitude or more increase in flux density at 1.4 GHz over the past decade, and relatively stable flux density at 3 GHz over the past 2 years.\nWe obtained follow-up observations with the VLA (1--15 GHz) on 01 Sep 2012, 17 Sep 2012, and 29 May 2014.\nThese observations reveal a Gigahertz-peaked spectrum source with an optically thick spectral index of 2.1 between 1--3 GHz.\nOn 01 Sep 2012, the spectrum peaks at 5 GHz with a flux density of about 10 mJy, and the optically

flux densities ($R\\simeq2.4$) indicates that this is a radio loud quasar.\nWe obtained a follow-up optical spectrum on 14 Sep 2012 with DIEMOS at Keck II (Figure~\\ref{fig:VTC233002-002736}, bottom panel).\nThe spectrum shows broad CIII] and MgII spectral lines allowing us to calculate the redshift, $z=1.65$.\n\nFrom the nature of the radio spectrum, the timescale of its evolution, and the nature of the host galaxy, we conclude that VTC233002-002736 is due to renewed jet-activity from a type-II radio loud \nquasar, where the GPS spectrum is indicative of a young jet.\nThe order-of-magnitude increase in flux density with respect to the FIRST survey could be indicative of an enhanced accretion phenomenon leading to an intensified jet.\nThe flattening of spectral index at GHz frequencies between 2012 and 2014 may imply cessation in the increased accretion episode and/or the interaction of the jet with the circum-nuclear material in the host galaxy.\n\n\\subsection{Transients Found Serendipitously}\\label{sec:radio_transients:serendipitous}\nThis subsection describes two transients that were found while manually inspecting archival radio

0.127$\\pm$0.065 mJy respectively.\n\nIn the FIRST and \\cite{hodge2011} surveys, the peak pixel values at the location of the transient candidate are $0.13\\pm0.11$ and $0.16\\pm0.06$ mJy respectively.\nThe optical counterpart of this transient is a 11th magnitude star, SDSS J230241.41+003450.2, classified as a K4Ve star by \\cite{torres2006}.\nThere is no evidence for binarity.\nFitting a blackbody to the photometric data from SDSS, the NOMAD catalog, and WISE gives an estimate of the effective temperature, 3800$\\pm$500 K, and the \ndistance, 70$\\pm$20 pc (assuming the radius of a main sequence star).\nSDSS J2302+00 derive a $v$~sin($i$) of 85 km s$^{-1}$.\nThis star has a ROSAT counterpart, 1RXS J230240.3+003453, 17\\arcsec$\\pm$12\\arcsec~away, whose hardness ratios are consistent with those of a coronal emitter.\nWe used a 1 keV APEC model in WebPIMMS to convert the ROSAT/PSPC countrate to a flux of $1.1\\times10^{-12}~\\mbox{erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$}$ in the 0.1--2.4 keV energy band.\n\nThe X-ray-to-optical flux ratio is 0.002, and the X-ray luminosity at a distance of 70 pc is $6.4\\times10^{29}~\\mbox{erg s$^{-1}$}$, both values being consistent with a dKe star.\nThe quiescent 3 GHz radio luminosity of VTC230241+003450 can therefore be estimated as $6.4\\times10^{14\\pm1}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ \\citep{benz1994,gudel2002}.\nThis can be compared with the flaring luminosity, $5.9\\times10^{15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$.\nWe conclude that this transient is a flare from a dKe star.\n\n\\section{Optical Properties of Radio Sources}\\label{sec:optical_properties}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTF carried out a concurrent optical survey which resulted in the identification of a few hundred thousand sources per epoch down to a limiting magnitude of R$\\simeq$21 mag\\footnote{Note that, \nfor the 60-second snapshots taken by PTF, the CCDs are saturated at $\\sim$10--11 mag. This represents the lower limiting magnitude of the optical study carried out here.}.\nOur radio survey further benefits from the presence of SDSS deep co-add images containing more than a million objects over the 50 deg$^2$ to r$\\simeq$23.5 mag \\citep{annis2011}.\nTo find optical counterparts of radio sources we followed the procedure from \\citep{hodge2011}.\nWe matched each source in the E2CAT with the SDSS and PTF catalogs using a 15\\arcsec ~matching radius, and selected only the nearest match.\nTo understand the false matching rate, we repeated the search by offsetting the radio source positions by 1\\arcmin ~in an arbitrary direction.\nThe resulting number of matches as a function of the matching radius is plotted as a histogram in Figure~\\ref{fig:matching}.\nBased on these results we choose a matching radius of 1\\arcsec ~for SDSS and 1.5\\arcsec ~for PTF to achieve a false matching rate of less than 3\\% and completeness better than 85\\%.\nThe PTF source positions for the faintest objects are known to have a larger scatter than theoretically expected, and hence the larger matching radius of 1.5\\arcsec ~is reasonable.\n\nUsing these matching radii, we found the optical counterparts of sources in the PSC.\nThe corresponding matching fraction in SDSS as a function of the r-band magnitude is shown graphically in Figure~\\ref{fig:radio_optical_quiescent}.\n49\\% of the radio sources in the PSC have an optical counterpart down to the SDSS r-band \nlimit\\footnote{If all the radio sources (components) from the E2CAT are matched with SDSS sources, then the completeness is much lower, $\\sim$35\\%.}.\n\\cite{hodge2011}, using the deep co-added SDSS images (limit i$\\sim$23.5 mag), found a matching ratio (within a 1\\arcsec~radius) of 44.4\\%. \nFor radio variable sources, we found a somewhat higher matching fraction of 63\\% (Figure~\\ref{fig:radio_optical_quiescent}), which is also in agreement with \\citeauthor{hodge2011}.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.6in]{images/matching.pdf}\n\\caption{The number of optical matches for the radio sources in E2CAT for different matching radii. \nSolid lines indicate the matching process carried out using the actual radio source positions and the \ndot-dashed lines indicate background matches found by offsetting the radio source positions by 1\\arcmin ~in \nan arbitrary direction. Blue and green lines show radio versus SDSS and PTF matching respectively.}\n\\label{fig:matching}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.6in]{images/radio_optical_quiescent.pdf}\n\\caption{Optical counterparts of persistent (blue) and variable (green) radio sources in the PSC. \nThe x-axis is r-band magnitude from SDSS. \nThe top panel gives the completeness of the radio-optical cross-matching, the middle panel \nshows histograms of persistent and variable radio sources with optical counterparts, and the bottom panel plots the \nradio flux densities versus optical magnitudes. The approximate limiting magnitudes for PTF (per-epoch; $R=21$ mag.) and \nSDSS (Stripe 82 co-add; $r=23.5$ mag.) are shown as red dashed lines.}\n\\label{fig:radio_optical_quiescent}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modest optical matching rate in our medium-wide, medium-deep survey\nwas not unexpected. \\cite{ivezic2002} compared the SDSS \n(limit r$\\sim$22 mag) and the FIRST (5$\\sigma\\sim$1 mJy) surveys over in 1230 \ndeg$^2$ of the sky and matched about 30\\% of the 108,000 FIRST radio\nsources.  \\cite{mcmahon2002} looked at the \n382,892 FIRST sources in the north Galactic cap and looked for optical\nmatches using the APM scans of POSS-I plates (R$\\sim$20 mag, B$\\sim$21.5 mag) for a 18\\% \nidentification rate (70,000 sources). The optical match rate improves\nsubstantially in deep, narrow surveys. For example, \\cite{huynh2008} use Australia\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA) data taken toward the Hubble Deep Field\n(HDF) at 20 cm, 11 cm, 6 cm and 3.6 cm, establishing a 66\\% matching \nof optical counterparts to I$=$23.5 mag. There is a strong color \ndependence, with the matching rate increasing from the blue to the near \ninfrared \\citep{bouchefry2007,smolcic2008}. Match rates approach 100\\% with the \nuse of deep infrared data \\citep{bonzini2012}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe near-real-time optical transient search carried out via image subtraction during the three-month high-cadence PTF observations resulted in approximately \n8 million detections.\nFollowing standard practice, about 0.9 million of these (corresponding to only $\\sim$50,000 unique optical sources) were identified in machine learning software as unlikely \nto be image subtraction artifacts, \nand further filtering was carried out using several stringent selection criteria (such as: at least two detections within one hour, no coincidence with stellar counterparts or AGN, etc.) \nand automated classifiers \\citep{bloom2012}.\nThis was followed by human inspection of the subtracted images, light curves, and automated classifications, and the list was narrowed down to 193 candidates for further follow-up.\nOut of the 193 candidates, only 10 sources were ultimately followed up spectroscopically, among which are 8 confirmed \nsupernovae, PTF12gzk (SN Ic, z$=$0.014), 12jaa (IIb, 0.024), 12giy (Ia, 0.029), 12hwb (Ia, 0.056), 12hmx (Ia, 0.085), 12iet (II, 0.095), 12ild (Ia, 0.17), and 12itq (Ia, 0.22).\nThe multi-wavelength observations of PTF12gzk have been discussed at length by \\cite{ben-ami2012,horesh2013}.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:SNe} we plot the optical light curves of these eight supernovae as well as the upper limits to their spectral luminosity in the radio.\nThe radio non-detections are in accordance with the expected flux densities of Type II, Ic and Ia supernovae (Table~\\ref{tab:transients_summary}).\nThe radio detection and subsequent non-detections of PTF12gzk from \\citeauthor{horesh2013} are also shown for reference, and these data emphasize the need for \ndeep radio observations for optically-bright supernovae such as the ones generally found by PTF.\nAfter all the survey observations were complete, we compiled optical light curves of sources using the catalogs hosted at IPAC (\\S\\ref{sec:optical_processing}).\nIn order to enable robust variability search, we selected only those optical sources having more than 16 reliable observations (unflagged in SExtractor) and R band magnitudes \nbetween 10 and 23.\n\nThere are 402,747 such sources in the PTF database with the 90\\% completeness of this sample corresponding to approximately an R band limiting magnitude of 21.\n802 (0.2\\%) of these sources have counterparts in the PSC (i.e. 22\\% of the PSC sources have optical counterparts).\n13,667 (3.4\\%) are optical variables\\footnote{Given the optical light curves, sources having a $\\chi^2$ probability less than 1 in 500,000 and variability $>$30\\%, i.e. \na standard deviation of $>$0.28 mag. were selected as optical variables. These criteria were designed to be similar to the radio variability criteria.}.\nOnly 42 radio sources have optical variable counterparts among the sample of 3652, while only two of these are variable also in the radio.\nThus, given the limiting magnitude of R$=$21 mag. in optical and our source detection threshold of $\\sim$0.5 mJy in the radio, we find that \nthe overlap between optical variables and radio variable sources is extremely small. \nThese demographics are succinctly presented in a Venn diagram in Figure~\\ref{fig:venn}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/SNe.pdf}\n\\caption{Light curves of the 8 spectroscopically-confirmed supernovae found in

radio transients and variables.\nA study of optical-only variables and transients from synoptic surveys is better done elsewhere in literature \\citep[e.g.][]{drake2009,rau2009}.\nWe have obtained photometric data from PTF and SDSS after searching for counterparts as described above.\nA compilation of the optical light curves of the radio variable sources is given in Figure~\\ref{fig:optical_variability}.\nMajority of the PTF light curves reveal sub-magnitude variability, while the SDSS light curves show gradual sub-magnitude or magnitude-level variability on timescales of years.\nThis is characteristic of AGN, where fluctuations in the accretion rate or other causes give rise to optical variability on a wide range of timescales.\nCoupled with radio variability information, it seems likely that all of these sources are AGN, excepting the ones associated with known stars.\n\n\n\\section{Summary \\& Discussion}\\label{sec:summary}\n\nWe have carried out a dedicated radio transient survey in a 50 deg$^2$ region of the SDSS Stripe 82. \nThis survey is a pilot for the Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a multi-epoch survey of the entire $\\sim$270 deg$^2$ of Stripe 82, which is currently underway.\nThe pilot observations were carried out with the Jansky VLA between 2--4 GHz over four epochs spaced logarithmically in time, i.e. having cadences of one week, one month, and 1.5 years.\nThe median rms noise per epoch is between 50 $\\mu$Jy and 90 $\\mu$Jy.\nWith this pilot we have successfully demonstrated the near-real-time calibration, imaging, and transient search capability with the Jansky VLA data.\nWe have found 142 sources displaying fractional variability beyond 30\\%. \nBased on radio follow-up observations, radio and optical variability, radio spectral indices, and multi-wavelength archival photometric data, almost all of these are likely to be due to shocks in AGN jets.\nWe have also found two bona fide radio transients associated with Galactic objects, a flare from an RS CVn binary and a dKe flare.\nComparison of our pilot survey data with the FIRST and VLA-Stripe 82 surveys has (unexpectedly) revealed a few additional, highly variable and transient, sources on timescales of 5--20 years.\nThese sources, most of which are either previously-known radio sources or have optical AGN hosts, are likely associated with renewed AGN activity. \nTwo other transients, found serendipitously, suggest that there are indeed many more transients in this dataset than the ones which we have found through our stringent selection criteria.\nWe encourage the astronomical community to take advantage of the data from this pilot radio survey (see \\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:DR} for the data release website) for finding \nthese hidden transients and for other science.\n\nA high-cadence optical survey using PTF was carried out over three months, contemporaneous with the first three epochs of the radio survey.\nThe motivation behind this joint survey was the selection of radio transients for rapid follow-up, preliminary classification of radio variables and transients based on \noptical light curves, and a direct comparison of the dynamic radio and optical skies.\nAs noted by previous radio and optical studies (see \\S\\ref{sec:optical_properties}), 20\\% of the persistent radio sources have an optical counterpart above the PTF limiting magnitude of 21, \nwhile 50\\% have counterparts above the SDSS limiting magnitude of 23.5 in the red filter.\nWe have found primarily slowly-evolving radio transients, and, within the sensitivity limits of our PTF and pilot Jansky VLA surveys, very little overlap between the optical and radio variable skies.\nOnly 0.05\\% of the radio point sources and $<$0.001\\% of the optical sources are variable at both frequencies.\nThe fraction of strong variables per square degree of the radio decimetric sky is at least an order of magnitude smaller than those in the optical sky.\nWe will now use the radio data to assess the degree of variability and the transient rate of the radio sky, and make recommendations for future surveys.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison of variability with previous surveys}\\label{sec:summary:variability}\n\nWe found only a small fraction ($142/3652 = 3.9^{+0.5}_{-0.9}\\%$) of the point sources varying by $>$30\\% on week-month-year timescales. \nMajority of these are variable only on a 1.5 year timescale, and as described in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients:final}, this variability fraction is to be taken as the upper limit.\nSeveral previous studies at 1.4 GHz \\citep{frail1994,deVries2004,croft2010,bannister2011a,bannister2011b,thyagarajan2011,mooley2013} \nhave shown that the fraction of variables on timescales between minutes and years, and flux densities between 0.1 mJy and 100 mJy, is $\\sim$1\\% or less.\nSimilar to these studies\\footnote{see http://tauceti.caltech.edu/kunal/radio-transient-surveys/index.html for a description of \npast variability studies}, we see that the 3 GHz sky is not highly variable on timescales longer than a few days.\nRadio follow-up observations, optical and radio light curves, and multi-wavelength archival data of the radio variable sources suggest that almost all of these are shock-related \nflaring in the jets of AGN.\n\nOur choice of modulation index for measuring variability and selection threshold introduces a bias towards selecting sources with large flux densities.\nA source in the PSC would have to have a mean flux density of 1.4 mJy in order to detect a 30\\% fractional variability, while at the 7$\\sigma$ source detection limit of \nof $\\sim$0.5 mJy, a source would have to have $|m|>3/4$ ($f_{\\rm var}>$120\\%) in order to be identified as a significant variable.\nFifteen strong variables (i.e. sources having $|m|>2/3$, or $f_{\\rm var}>$100\\%) were identified in our survey, but only 3000 sources in the PSC are bright enough ($>$0.55 mJy) \nto have been identified as a strong variable. \nWe can therefore conclude that the fraction of strong variables is less than one percent.\n\nRadio variability appears to be a function of timescale; the variability on hours$\\sim$days timescales contrasts with the variability on weeks$\\sim$years timescales.\n\\cite{ofek2011} found that $\\sim$30\\% of point sources brighter than 1.5 mJy at 5 GHz \nwere variable, with majority of the sources varying on timescales $<$10 days.\nThis variability is primarily small amplitude (modulation indices of less than 0.2).\nThe structure function of the variable sources constructed by \\citeauthor{ofek2011} shows a sharp rise on timescales of $<$1 day, a shallow but steady rise \nbetween 1--10 days, and a roughly constant value beyond 10 days.\nA large fraction of variables displaying small variability amplitudes on short timescales were also found by the MASIV survey \\citep{lovell2008} conducted at 5 GHz.\nThe findings of \\citeauthor{ofek2011} and \\citeauthor{lovell2008} suggest that the low-amplitude variability on timescales of $<$10 days is mostly extrnisic.\nAmong the \\citeauthor{ofek2011} radio sources, only 0.3\\% have modulation indices greater than 0.2 on timescales less than two years.\nThe variability fraction that we find on week-month timescales in our pilot survey is similar ($\\lesssim$1\\%), and agrees with the \nvariability fraction found in narrow-deep surveys by \\cite{frail1994}, \\cite{carilli2003}, and \\cite{mooley2013}, wide-field surveys such as \n\\cite{williams2013}, and other studies between 1--5 GHz on week-month-year timescales.\nOn 1.5 year timescale we find the variability fraction to be less than 4\\%.\nRecently, \\cite{hodge2013} compared the 1.4 GHz VLA-Stripe 82 and FIRST surveys, and found $\\sim$12\\% (6 percent per epoch $\\times$ 2 epochs) of the sources \nhaving fractional variablility larger than 0.3 on timescales between 7 years and 22 years, the majority of which were AGN.\n\nWhile it is possible that, on these longer timescales, the fraction of variable sources in the radio sky is large, some \nof the \\cite{hodge2013} variables could be artificial and solely due to angular resolution differences between the VLA-Stripe 82 and FIRST surveys\\footnote{However, \n\\cite{hodge2013} assert that the fractional variability of 0.30 used in their work is equivalent to a fractional variability of 0.22 in \\cite{deVries2004} due to a \nbias that gets introduced from using integrated flux densities.\nThey also note that the distribution of variability amplitudes seen in their sample is roughly consistent with the extragalactic sample of \\citeauthor{deVries2004}.}.\nIndeed, \\cite{becker2010}, \\cite{bannister2011a}, and \\cite{croft2010} find that the fraction of variables on similar timescales is a few percent or less.\n\nRadio variability (especially extrinsic) is expected to have a frequency dependence, but this aspect of variability has not been extensively studied.\nWe can only use the results of past blind surveys to conclude that the fraction of strong variables is less than a few percent between frequencies of 1 GHz and 5 GHz, \nbetween flux densities of $\\sim$0.3 mJy and $\\sim$100 mJy, and over a wide gamut of timescales (between one day and several years).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our pilot survey, we found a single AGN, VTC233002-002736, with flux density $>$3 mJy at 1.4 GHz, that appears to have increased in flux density by more than a factor of ten over the past 15 years.\nSimilar objects may have been found earlier, by \\cite{bannister2011a,bannister2011b}, in the SUMSS survey (e.g. J201524-395949 or J060938-333508).\nIt is likely that such phenomena are a result of episodes of enhanced accretion leading to increased jet \nactivity \\citep[see][for discussions of possibly related phenomena]{kunert2006,czerny2009,kunert2010,elitzur2014,keel2014,lamassa2015}.\nAssuming a timescale of $\\sim$20 years for an enhanced accretion episode, and given that fact that 50 deg$^2$ of the sky has $\\sim$2000 AGN with flux density $>$3 mJy \\citep{white1997,hopkins2002}, we can estimate \nthe period of occurrence of such episodes over the lifetime of an AGN: $\\sim$40,000 years.\nThis is remarkably consistent with previous studies \\citep{reynolds1997,czerny2009,kunert2010} suggesting some young radio-loud AGN to have short-lived jets operating on time scales of 10$^4$--10$^5$ years.\n\n\n\\subsection{Transient Rates}\\label{sec:summary:rate}\n\nWe searched our four-epoch dataset for transients and found only a single source in the PSC (VTC223612+001006; RSCVn) that was present in one epoch and absent in the rest.\nOur transient search was carried out over a single-epoch area of $\\sim$52 deg$^2$, but the sensitivity is not uniform across this area.\nFor the first three epochs, our transient search was conducted on single-pointing images out to a radius ($r_{\\rm max}$) of $\\sim$8\\arcmin ~from the pointing center.\nAlthough the fourth epoch has fairly uniform

Note that the PTF limiting sensitivity of $R=21$ mag. corresponds to 12$\\mu$Jy.}.\n\nThe rates for extragalactic transients, like core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, are significantly low (Table~\\ref{tab:transients_summary}), and it is not \nsurprising that we found none of these transients in our pilot radio survey.\nSurveys over large areas of the sky are thus motivated by the search for such exotica.\nTherefore, we recommend wide-field surveys like that of the entire $\\sim$270 deg$^2$ of Stripe 82 with the Jansky VLA (the CNSS survey, which is currently underway), all-sky surveys like \nthe VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; the all-sky tier has been recently approved), or similar surveys with ASKAP, MeerKAT, and WSRT/Apertif.\nAlso, shallow radio surveys are preferred to deep surveys due to the added advantage of restricting the transient population to a low redshift space, thus making optical counterpart search feasible.\n\n{\\it\nAcknowledgemets: The authors extend sincere thanks to Joan Wrobel and other scheduling staff at the NRAO in Socorro for \nextensive help with the scheduling of the VLA observations, and to James Robnett and other computing staff \nfor their untiring assistance with the data storage and allocation of computing resources.\nThe authors also wish to thank Luis Ho, Branimir Sesar, Eran Ofek, Sanjay Bhatnagar, Urvashi Rau, Kumar Golap, Vivek Dhawan, Craig Walker, \nTalvikki Hovatta, Tim Pearson, Anthony Readhead, Chuck Steidel, and Allison Strom for insightful discussions. \nThe contribution of PTF collaboration members to optical data processing and optical follow-up observations relevant for this project is acknowledged.\nKPM is grateful to NRAO for the Grote Reber Fellowship, and to Yamini Jangir for going over this manuscript and providing useful suggestions.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for comments which helped in improving certain parts of the manuscript.\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National \nScience Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated \nUniversities, Inc.

FIRST \\citep{white1997} and VLA-Stripe 82 \\citep{hodge2011}, and\nselected $\\sim$10 point sources with implied spectral indices more than 2.5 or less than -2.5 between 3 GHz and 1.4 GHz.\nThis was motivated by the search for transients such as supernovae and tidal disruption events \\citep[Swift J1644+57-like; ][]{zauderer2011,zauderer2013} which evolve on a timescale of years. \nHowever, most of these candidates turned out to be either GPS sources or flaring AGN (see below).\n\nOur final list of candidates for follow-up consisted of 20 objects that displayed a factor of two or more fractional variability between any two epochs, or were \nnew bright sources compared with previous surveys at 1.4 GHz. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Search for Variables and Transients after Final Data Processing}\\label{sec:radio_transients:final}\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter correcting for the aberrant complex gains during the final data processing (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final}), we carried out \na careful search for variables and transients bearing in mind the possibility of gain compression (\\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:rfi}) in the target fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain consistency during our variability and transient search, we only compared epochs E1, E3, and E4 with epoch E2 in order to probe variability on \ntimescales of one month, one week, and 1.5 years respectively.\nNote that among the first three epochs, E2 was the least affected by RFI.\n\nFor each source in the PSC, we calculated the statistical quantity $V_s$ using equation~\\ref{eqn:var_2epoch}.\nThere appeared to be a small deviation of this statistic from the expected distribution (Student's t distribution).\nThis may be a result of low-level gain compression in the target fields.\nAlthough the epoch-to-epoch flux densities are not significantly discrepant, we addressed this issue by applying small, relative, corrections to the ratios \nof and the differences in the flux densities of sources between the two epochs being compared.\n\nFor the one-week and one-month comparison, we made multiplicative corrections of 2\\%$\\pm$3\\% (median value with standard deviation) to the ratios of flux densities and \nadditive corrections of 20 $\\mu$Jy $\\pm$ 50 $\\mu$Jy to the differences in the flux densities of sources in the PSC.\nThese corrections were derived for the two-epoch comparisons by plotting the ratios and differences of flux densities of sources as a function of time of observation \nand demanding the ratios and differences to be centered at unity and zero respectively.\n\n\nDuring the comparison between epochs E4 and E2, we found it necessary to make two independent sets of corrections to the ratios of flux densities.\nIn the first set, multiplicative corrections of 3\\%$\\pm$4\\% were seen to be correlated with the declination of the sources.\nThis discrepancy of flux densities in epoch E4 with respect to epoch E2 is a result of the the OTF survey design and the near-real-time imaging process, and \nwill be described in detail in CNSS Paper II.\nIn short, during the OTF observations carried out for epoch E4, the primary beam moved by 4\\arcmin~within every scan; this was not accounted for in the imaging step.\n\nThe resulting fractional change in flux density of a source depends on its position in the primary beam.\nThis effect is manifested as a sinusoidal pattern when the flux density ratios are plotted as a function of source declinations.\nThe second set of corrections consist of multiplicative corrections of 4\\%$\\pm$4\\% to the ratios of flux densities and may be attributed to gain compression.\nAdditive corrections of 10 $\\mu$Jy $\\pm$ 30 $\\mu$Jy were applied to the differences in the flux densities between epochs E4 and E2.\nWith the application of these small, first-order, corrections we ensure to not over-fit the data and remove real variability in flux densities of the sources in the PSC.\n\n\nThe histograms showing the resultant distributions of the variability statistic, $V_s$, is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:varstat}.\nIt is evident that, after the corrections, $V_s$ agrees well with the Student's t distribution (however, see note on the 1.5 year distribution below).\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/varstat.pdf}\n\\caption{A histogram of the variability statistic, $V_s$, for sources in the PSC. \nAfter the application of the corrections to the flux densities mentioned in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients}, \n$V_s$ agrees with the expected distribution, Student's t.}\n\\label{fig:varstat}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nTo determine additional sources of artificial variability, we ran further intensive tests with manual flagging and imaging. \nWe found variations of up to a few percent in the flux densities of sources just by choosing different values for the input parameters to the CASA {\\it clean} task.\nSpecifically, these parameters are: cleaning iterations ({\\it niter}) and Taylor terms (nterms).\nWe also noticed variations by changing the values provided to the {\\it clipminmax} parameter in the {\\it flagdata} task.\nAdditionally, we know that the flux density absolute calibration (we used 3C48 as the flux density standard calibrator in our survey) is usually accurate \nto only 3--5\\% \\citep[e.g.][]{ofek2011,thyagarajan2011,mooley2013}.\n\nAll in all, due to gain compression and other possible causes of artificial variability mentioned above, we adopt a conservative criterion for selection of \nour variable sources: fractional variability greater than 0.3 ($|m|>0.26$).\n\n\n\n\n\nOur final variability selection criteria are $V_s\\geqslant4.3$ and $|m|>0.26$.\nThe plots of the $V_s$ versus $m$ for sources in the PSC after applying the corrections mentioned earlier in this subsection are shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:varstat_m}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=7in]{images/varstat_m.png}\n\\caption{The variability statistic, $V_s$, as a function of the modulation index, $m$, for sources in the PSC for the various timescales considered in this work.\nThe dashed red lines indicate our selection criteria for variables. \nFilled gray circles denote sources that are not variable while red circles have been selected as variables. \nThe sizes of the circles indicate the mean flux densities of the sources in the two epochs being compared.\nWe find 38, 31, and 96 variable sources on timescales of one week, one month, and 1.5 years respectively, amounting to a total of 142 variable sources.\nThe upper x-axis in each of the three panels represents the fractional variability as given by equation~\\ref{eqn:fvar}.\nSee \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients} for details.}\n\\label{fig:varstat_m}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nFor the sources in the PSC satisfying the variability selection criteria, we manually inspected the image cutouts and their fitted Gaussian \nparameters, viz. major axes ($b$), minor axes ($a$), the peak flux densities ($S_{\\rm peak}$) and the integrated flux densities ($S_{\\rm int}$), in order to ensure that they are not resolved. \nFor sources detected at a high significance level (SNR$\\gtrsim$15), we used the criteria: $S_{\\rm int}/S_{\\rm peak}\\lesssim1.1$, $b\\lesssim1.1\\times${\\tt BMAJ}, and \n$a\\lesssim1.1\\times${\\tt BMIN}, where the variables in typewriter text denote the major and minor axes of the synthesized beam. \nFor the sources detected at low significance, we relaxed the integrated-to-peak flux density ratio to 1.3--1.5.\nThis procedure for selecting unresolved is motivated by the standard techniques used for deep radio surveys \\citep[e.g. ][]{huynh2005,franzen2015}.\nWhile this approach \\citep[c.f.][]{hodge2013} errs on the conservative side, we prefer to identify real variables rather than false positives caused by resolution effects.\n\n\nWe thus find 142 variables among 3652 sources in our PSC, or, in other words, about 3.8\\% of the sample has fractional variability more than 30\\% on timescales $<$1.5 years.\nThe number of point sources varying on week, month, and 1.5 year timescales are 38, 31, and 96 respectively, or 1.0\\%, 0.8\\% and 2.6\\% respectively.\nThese sources are listed in Table~\\ref{tab:transients}.\nA glance at Figure~\\ref{fig:varstat} suggests that the variability statistic, $V_s$, comparing epochs E2 and E4 (probing variability on a timescale of 1.5 years) deviates from the \nStudent's t distribution in the tail.\nThis may be due to some calibration errors from the near-real-time processing that we have not tried correcting for, and therefore the fraction of variables on a 1.5-year timescale, 2.6\\%, \nis likely an upper limit.\nNote that the variable sources are distributed uniformly on the sky with no pattern indicative of particular region(s) of the sky being affected by calibration errors.\n\nSince our 50 deg$^2$ survey region contains rich archival data from the FIRST and VLA-Stripe 82 surveys, we extended our transient search \nto timescales of up to $\\sim$20 years.\nWe compared the 3 GHz peak flux densities of sources in the PSC with the 1.4 GHz peak flux densities from these two surveys (Figure~\\ref{fig:var_CNSS_FIRST_Hodge}).\n\nThe mean spectral index\\footnote{We define the spectral index, $\\alpha$, as $S\\propto\\nu^\\alpha$.}, $\\alpha_{\\rm mean}$, appears to be between $-0.5$ and $-1$, as expected \\citep[e.g.][]{randall2012}.\n\n\nWith the view of finding only the extreme variable and transient candidates, we searched beyond implied spectral indices of $-$1$\\pm$2.5 (i.e. less than $-3.5$ or greater than 1.5) \nwith respect to the FIRST survey, and beyond $-$0.5$\\pm$2.5 with respect to the VLA-Stripe 82 survey.\n\nThe threshold of $\\pm$2.5 in spectral index is somewhat arbitrary; it is motivated by our need for filtering out most of the sources and selecting only a few, extreme, objects.\nOur search resulted in 11 unique objects.\nTwo candidates are resolved out (closely-separated radio lobes) in our data; one candidate is identified as such due to its erroneously absent in VLA-Stripe 82 catalog (but present in the image); \nand one candidate, VTC220456-000147, is identified as a variable also on a timescale of 1 month.\n\nAccordingly, out of the eight genuine variables\\footnote{Note that any extragalactic source variable on

luminosity, the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio of 1.4$\\times$10$^{-3}$, and the spectral type all suggest that HD 214129 is an RS CVn-type binary.\n\nAccordingly, we expect the quiescent 3 GHz radio luminosity of the transient to be $L_R \\lesssim 10^{15 \\pm 1}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ \\citep[][; however, strictly speaking, \ntheir L$_X$-L$_R$ relationship is valid for 5 GHz flux density]{benz1994,gudel2002}.\nFrom epoch E4 we get the 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the quiescent 3 GHz flux density of this transient as $2.4\\times10^{15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$.\nUsing a distance of 100 pc, we can estimate the flaring radio luminosity in epoch E1 as $1.1\\times10^{16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$.\nFrom the binarity, the optical spectrum, radio and X-ray luminosities, X-ray hardness ratios from ROSAT, and the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio, we conclude that this radio transient is \na flare from an active binary system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{VTC225707-010238: Flaring

survey at the location of VTC233002-002736 is $0.34\\pm0.13$ mJy (mean epoch 1999.2).\nThis implies an order of magnitude or more increase in flux density at 1.4 GHz over the past decade, and relatively stable flux density at 3 GHz over the past 2 years.\nWe obtained follow-up observations with the VLA (1--15 GHz) on 01 Sep 2012, 17 Sep 2012, and 29 May 2014.\nThese observations reveal a Gigahertz-peaked spectrum source with an optically thick spectral index of 2.1 between 1--3 GHz.\nOn 01 Sep 2012, the spectrum peaks at 5 GHz with a flux density of about 10 mJy, and the optically

3 GHz, suggesting a significant evolution \nin the spectrum beyond 3 GHz.\nThe radio continuum spectra from the survey and follow-up observations are shown in the inset of the top panel of

Figure~\\ref{fig:VTC233002-002736}.\nThe optical to mid-infrared part of the spectrum agrees well with a type-II quasar template from \\cite{polletta2007}.\nA comparison between the radio and optical flux densities ($R\\simeq2.4$) indicates that this is a radio loud quasar.\nWe obtained a follow-up optical spectrum on 14 Sep 2012 with DIEMOS at Keck II (Figure~\\ref{fig:VTC233002-002736}, bottom panel).\nThe spectrum shows broad CIII] and MgII spectral lines allowing us to calculate the redshift, $z=1.65$.\n\nFrom the nature of the radio spectrum, the timescale of its evolution, and the nature of the host galaxy, we conclude that VTC233002-002736 is due to renewed jet-activity from a type-II radio loud \nquasar, where the GPS spectrum is indicative of a young jet.\nThe order-of-magnitude increase in flux density with respect to the FIRST survey could be indicative of an enhanced accretion phenomenon leading to an intensified jet.\nThe flattening of spectral index at GHz frequencies between 2012 and 2014 may imply cessation in the increased accretion episode and/or the interaction of the jet with the circum-nuclear material in the host galaxy.\n\n\\subsection{Transients Found Serendipitously}\\label{sec:radio_transients:serendipitous}\nThis subsection describes two transients that were found while manually inspecting archival radio

respectively.\nThe optical counterpart of this transient is a 11th magnitude star, SDSS J230241.41+003450.2, classified as a K4Ve star by \\cite{torres2006}.\nThere is no evidence for binarity.\nFitting a blackbody to the photometric data from SDSS, the NOMAD catalog, and WISE gives an estimate of the effective temperature, 3800$\\pm$500 K, and the \ndistance, 70$\\pm$20 pc (assuming the radius of a main sequence star).\nSDSS J2302+00 derive a $v$~sin($i$) of 85 km s$^{-1}$.\nThis star has a ROSAT counterpart, 1RXS J230240.3+003453, 17\\arcsec$\\pm$12\\arcsec~away, whose hardness ratios are consistent with those of a coronal emitter.\nWe used a 1 keV APEC model in WebPIMMS to convert the ROSAT/PSPC countrate to a flux of $1.1\\times10^{-12}~\\mbox{erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$}$ in the 0.1--2.4 keV energy band.\n\nThe X-ray-to-optical flux ratio is 0.002, and the X-ray luminosity at a distance of 70 pc is $6.4\\times10^{29}~\\mbox{erg s$^{-1}$}$, both values being consistent with a dKe star.\nThe quiescent 3 GHz radio luminosity of VTC230241+003450 can therefore be estimated as $6.4\\times10^{14\\pm1}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ \\citep{benz1994,gudel2002}.\nThis can be compared with the flaring luminosity, $5.9\\times10^{15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$.\nWe conclude that this transient is a flare from a dKe star.\n\n\\section{Optical Properties of Radio Sources}\\label{sec:optical_properties}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTF carried out a concurrent optical survey which resulted in the identification of a few hundred thousand sources per epoch down to a limiting magnitude of R$\\simeq$21 mag\\footnote{Note that, \nfor the 60-second snapshots taken by PTF, the CCDs are saturated at $\\sim$10--11 mag. This represents the lower limiting magnitude of the optical study carried out here.}.\nOur radio survey further benefits from the presence of SDSS deep co-add images containing more than a million objects over the 50 deg$^2$ to r$\\simeq$23.5 mag \\citep{annis2011}.\nTo find optical counterparts of radio sources we followed the procedure from \\citep{hodge2011}.\nWe matched each source in the E2CAT with the SDSS and PTF catalogs using a 15\\arcsec ~matching radius, and selected only the nearest match.\nTo understand the false matching rate, we repeated the search by offsetting the radio source positions by 1\\arcmin ~in an arbitrary direction.\nThe resulting number of matches as a function of the matching radius is plotted as a histogram in Figure~\\ref{fig:matching}.\nBased on these results we choose a matching radius of 1\\arcsec ~for SDSS and 1.5\\arcsec ~for PTF to achieve a false matching rate of less than 3\\% and completeness better than 85\\%.\nThe PTF source positions for the faintest objects are known to have a larger scatter than theoretically expected, and hence the larger matching radius of 1.5\\arcsec ~is reasonable.\n\nUsing these matching radii, we found the optical counterparts of sources in the PSC.\nThe corresponding matching fraction in SDSS as a function of the r-band magnitude is shown graphically in Figure~\\ref{fig:radio_optical_quiescent}.\n49\\% of the radio sources in the PSC have an optical counterpart down to the SDSS r-band \nlimit\\footnote{If all the radio sources (components) from the E2CAT are matched with SDSS sources, then the completeness is much lower, $\\sim$35\\%.}.\n\\cite{hodge2011}, using the deep co-added SDSS images (limit i$\\sim$23.5 mag), found a matching ratio (within a 1\\arcsec~radius) of 44.4\\%. \nFor radio variable sources, we found a somewhat higher matching fraction of 63\\% (Figure~\\ref{fig:radio_optical_quiescent}), which is also in agreement with \\citeauthor{hodge2011}.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.6in]{images/matching.pdf}\n\\caption{The number of optical matches for the radio sources in E2CAT for different matching radii. \nSolid lines indicate the matching process carried out using the actual radio source positions and the \ndot-dashed lines indicate background matches found by offsetting the radio source positions by 1\\arcmin ~in \nan arbitrary direction. Blue and green lines show radio versus SDSS and PTF matching respectively.}\n\\label{fig:matching}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.6in]{images/radio_optical_quiescent.pdf}\n\\caption{Optical counterparts of persistent (blue) and variable (green) radio sources in the PSC. \nThe x-axis is r-band magnitude from SDSS. \nThe top panel gives the completeness of the radio-optical cross-matching, the middle panel \nshows histograms of persistent and variable radio sources with optical counterparts, and the bottom panel plots the \nradio flux densities versus optical magnitudes.

The optical match rate improves\nsubstantially in deep, narrow surveys. For example, \\cite{huynh2008} use Australia\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA) data taken toward the Hubble Deep Field\n(HDF) at 20 cm, 11 cm, 6 cm and 3.6 cm, establishing a 66\\% matching \nof optical counterparts to I$=$23.5 mag. There is a strong color \ndependence, with the matching rate increasing from the blue to the near \ninfrared \\citep{bouchefry2007,smolcic2008}. Match rates approach 100\\% with the \nuse of deep infrared data \\citep{bonzini2012}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe near-real-time optical transient search carried out via image subtraction during the three-month high-cadence PTF observations resulted in approximately \n8 million detections.\nFollowing standard practice, about 0.9 million of these (corresponding to only $\\sim$50,000 unique optical sources) were identified in machine learning software as unlikely \nto be image subtraction artifacts, \nand further filtering was carried out using several stringent selection criteria (such as: at least two detections within one hour, no coincidence with stellar counterparts or AGN, etc.) \nand automated classifiers \\citep{bloom2012}.\nThis was followed by human inspection of the subtracted images, light curves, and automated classifications, and the list was narrowed down to 193 candidates for further follow-up.\nOut of the 193 candidates, only 10 sources were ultimately followed up spectroscopically, among which are 8 confirmed \nsupernovae, PTF12gzk (SN Ic, z$=$0.014), 12jaa (IIb, 0.024), 12giy (Ia, 0.029), 12hwb (Ia, 0.056), 12hmx (Ia, 0.085), 12iet (II, 0.095), 12ild (Ia, 0.17), and 12itq (Ia, 0.22).\nThe multi-wavelength observations of PTF12gzk have been discussed at length by \\cite{ben-ami2012,horesh2013}.\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:SNe} we plot the optical light curves of these eight supernovae as well as the upper limits to their spectral luminosity in the radio.\nThe radio non-detections are in accordance with the expected flux densities of Type II, Ic and Ia supernovae (Table~\\ref{tab:transients_summary}).\nThe radio detection and subsequent non-detections of PTF12gzk from \\citeauthor{horesh2013} are also shown for reference, and these data emphasize the need for \ndeep radio observations for optically-bright supernovae such as the ones generally found by PTF.\nAfter all the survey observations were complete, we compiled optical light curves of sources using the catalogs hosted at IPAC (\\S\\ref{sec:optical_processing}).\nIn order to enable robust variability search, we selected only those optical sources having more than 16 reliable observations (unflagged in SExtractor) and R band magnitudes \nbetween 10 and 23.\n\nThere are 402,747 such sources in the PTF database with the 90\\% completeness of this sample corresponding to approximately an R band limiting magnitude of 21.\n802 (0.2\\%) of these sources have counterparts in the PSC (i.e. 22\\% of the PSC sources have optical counterparts).\n13,667 (3.4\\%) are optical variables\\footnote{Given the optical light curves, sources having a $\\chi^2$ probability less than 1 in 500,000 and variability $>$30\\%, i.e. \na standard deviation of $>$0.28 mag. were selected as optical variables. These criteria were designed to be similar to the radio variability criteria.}.\nOnly 42 radio sources have optical variable counterparts among the sample of 3652, while only two of these are variable also in the radio.\nThus, given the limiting magnitude of R$=$21 mag. in optical and our source detection threshold of $\\sim$0.5 mJy in the radio, we find that \nthe overlap between optical variables and radio variable sources is extremely small. \nThese demographics are succinctly presented in a Venn diagram in Figure~\\ref{fig:venn}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/SNe.pdf}\n\\caption{Light curves of the 8 spectroscopically-confirmed supernovae found in

radio transients and variables.\nA study of optical-only variables and transients from synoptic surveys is better done elsewhere in literature \\citep[e.g.][]{drake2009,rau2009}.\nWe have obtained photometric data from PTF and SDSS after searching for counterparts as described above.\nA compilation of the optical light curves of the radio variable sources is given in Figure~\\ref{fig:optical_variability}.\nMajority of the PTF light curves reveal sub-magnitude variability, while the SDSS light curves show gradual sub-magnitude or magnitude-level variability on timescales of years.\nThis is characteristic of AGN, where fluctuations in the accretion rate or other causes give rise to optical variability on a wide range of timescales.\nCoupled with radio variability information, it seems likely that all of these sources are AGN, excepting the ones associated with known stars.\n\n\n\\section{Summary \\& Discussion}\\label{sec:summary}\n\nWe have carried out a dedicated radio transient survey in a 50 deg$^2$ region of the SDSS Stripe 82. \nThis survey is a pilot for the Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a multi-epoch survey of the entire $\\sim$270 deg$^2$ of Stripe 82, which is currently underway.\nThe pilot observations were carried out with the Jansky VLA between 2--4 GHz over four epochs spaced logarithmically in time, i.e. having cadences of one week, one month, and 1.5 years.\nThe median rms noise per epoch is between 50 $\\mu$Jy and 90 $\\mu$Jy.\nWith this pilot we have successfully demonstrated the near-real-time calibration, imaging, and transient search capability with the Jansky VLA data.\nWe have found 142 sources displaying fractional variability beyond 30\\%. \nBased on radio follow-up observations, radio and optical variability, radio spectral indices, and multi-wavelength archival photometric data, almost all of these are likely to be due to shocks in AGN jets.\nWe have also found two bona fide radio transients associated with Galactic objects, a flare from an RS CVn binary and a dKe flare.\nComparison of our pilot survey data with the FIRST and VLA-Stripe 82 surveys has (unexpectedly) revealed a few additional, highly variable and transient, sources on timescales of 5--20 years.\nThese sources, most of which are either previously-known radio sources or have optical AGN hosts, are likely associated with renewed AGN activity. \nTwo other transients, found serendipitously, suggest that there are indeed many more transients in this dataset than the ones which we have found through our stringent selection criteria.\nWe encourage the astronomical community to take advantage of the data from this pilot radio survey (see \\S\\ref{sec:radio_processing:final:DR} for the data release website) for finding \nthese hidden transients and for other science.\n\nA high-cadence optical survey using PTF was carried out over three months, contemporaneous with the first three epochs of the radio survey.\nThe motivation behind this joint survey was the selection of radio transients for rapid follow-up, preliminary classification of radio variables and transients based on \noptical light curves, and a direct comparison of the dynamic radio and optical skies.\nAs noted by previous radio and optical studies (see \\S\\ref{sec:optical_properties}), 20\\% of the persistent radio sources have an optical counterpart above the PTF limiting magnitude of 21, \nwhile 50\\% have counterparts above the SDSS limiting magnitude of 23.5 in the red filter.\nWe have found primarily slowly-evolving radio transients, and, within the sensitivity limits of our PTF and pilot Jansky VLA surveys, very little overlap between the optical and radio variable skies.\nOnly 0.05\\% of the radio point sources and $<$0.001\\% of the optical sources are variable at both frequencies.\nThe fraction of strong variables per square degree of the radio decimetric sky is at least an order of magnitude smaller than those in the optical sky.\nWe will now use the radio data to assess the degree of variability and the transient rate of the radio sky, and make recommendations for future surveys.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison of variability with previous surveys}\\label{sec:summary:variability}\n\nWe found only a small fraction ($142/3652 = 3.9^{+0.5}_{-0.9}\\%$) of the point sources varying by $>$30\\% on week-month-year timescales. \nMajority of these are variable only on a 1.5 year timescale, and as described in \\S\\ref{sec:radio_transients:final}, this variability fraction is to be taken as the upper limit.\nSeveral previous studies at 1.4 GHz \\citep{frail1994,deVries2004,croft2010,bannister2011a,bannister2011b,thyagarajan2011,mooley2013} \nhave shown that the fraction of variables on timescales between minutes and years, and flux densities between 0.1 mJy and 100 mJy, is $\\sim$1\\% or less.\nSimilar to these studies\\footnote{see http://tauceti.caltech.edu/kunal/radio-transient-surveys/index.html for a description of \npast variability studies}, we see that the 3 GHz sky is not highly variable on timescales longer than a few days.\nRadio follow-up observations, optical and radio light curves, and multi-wavelength archival data of the radio variable sources suggest that almost all of these are shock-related \nflaring in the jets of AGN.\n\nOur choice of modulation index for measuring variability and selection threshold introduces a bias towards selecting sources with large flux densities.\nA source in the PSC would have to have a mean flux density of 1.4 mJy in order to detect a 30\\% fractional variability, while at the 7$\\sigma$ source detection limit of \nof $\\sim$0.5 mJy, a source would have to have $|m|>3/4$ ($f_{\\rm var}>$120\\%) in order to be identified as a significant variable.\nFifteen strong variables (i.e. sources having $|m|>2/3$, or $f_{\\rm var}>$100\\%) were identified in our survey, but only 3000 sources in the PSC are bright enough ($>$0.55 mJy) \nto have been identified as a strong variable. \nWe can therefore conclude that the fraction of strong variables is less than one percent.\n\nRadio variability appears to be a function of timescale; the variability on hours$\\sim$days timescales contrasts with the variability on weeks$\\sim$years timescales.\n\\cite{ofek2011} found that $\\sim$30\\% of point sources brighter than 1.5 mJy at 5 GHz \nwere variable, with majority of the sources varying on timescales $<$10 days.\nThis variability is primarily small amplitude (modulation indices of less than 0.2).\nThe structure function of the variable sources constructed by \\citeauthor{ofek2011} shows a sharp rise on timescales of $<$1 day, a shallow but steady rise \nbetween 1--10 days, and a roughly constant value beyond 10 days.\nA large fraction of variables displaying small variability amplitudes on short timescales were also found by the MASIV survey \\citep{lovell2008} conducted at 5 GHz.\nThe findings of \\citeauthor{ofek2011} and \\citeauthor{lovell2008} suggest that the low-amplitude variability on timescales of $<$10 days is mostly extrnisic.\nAmong the \\citeauthor{ofek2011} radio sources, only 0.3\\% have modulation indices greater than 0.2 on timescales less than two years.\nThe variability fraction that we find on week-month timescales in our pilot survey is similar ($\\lesssim$1\\%), and agrees with the \nvariability fraction found in narrow-deep surveys by \\cite{frail1994}, \\cite{carilli2003}, and \\cite{mooley2013}, wide-field surveys such as \n\\cite{williams2013}, and other studies between 1--5 GHz on week-month-year timescales.\nOn 1.5 year timescale we find the variability fraction to be less than 4\\%.\nRecently, \\cite{hodge2013} compared the 1.4 GHz VLA-Stripe 82 and FIRST surveys, and found $\\sim$12\\% (6 percent per epoch $\\times$ 2 epochs) of the sources \nhaving fractional variablility larger than 0.3 on timescales between 7 years and 22 years, the majority of which were AGN.\n\nWhile it is possible that, on these longer timescales, the fraction of variable sources in the radio sky is large, some \nof the \\cite{hodge2013} variables could be artificial and solely due to angular resolution differences between the VLA-Stripe 82 and FIRST surveys\\footnote{However, \n\\cite{hodge2013} assert that the fractional variability of 0.30 used in their work is equivalent to a fractional variability of 0.22 in \\cite{deVries2004} due to a \nbias that gets introduced from using integrated flux densities.\nThey also note that the distribution of variability amplitudes seen in their sample is roughly consistent with the extragalactic sample of \\citeauthor{deVries2004}.}.\nIndeed, \\cite{becker2010}, \\cite{bannister2011a}, and \\cite{croft2010} find that the fraction of variables on similar timescales is a few percent or less.\n\nRadio variability (especially extrinsic) is expected to have a frequency dependence, but this aspect of variability has not been extensively studied.\nWe can only use the results of past blind surveys to conclude that the fraction of strong variables is less than a few percent between frequencies of 1 GHz and 5 GHz, \nbetween flux densities of $\\sim$0.3 mJy and $\\sim$100 mJy, and over a wide gamut of timescales (between one day and several years).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our pilot survey, we found a single AGN, VTC233002-002736, with flux density $>$3 mJy at 1.4 GHz, that appears to have increased in flux density by more than a factor of ten over the past 15 years.\nSimilar objects may have been found earlier, by \\cite{bannister2011a,bannister2011b}, in the SUMSS survey (e.g. J201524-395949 or J060938-333508).\nIt is likely that such phenomena are a result of episodes of enhanced accretion leading to increased jet \nactivity \\citep[see][for discussions of possibly related phenomena]{kunert2006,czerny2009,kunert2010,elitzur2014,keel2014,lamassa2015}.\nAssuming a timescale of $\\sim$20 years for an enhanced accretion episode, and given that fact that 50 deg$^2$ of the sky has $\\sim$2000 AGN with flux density $>$3 mJy \\citep{white1997,hopkins2002}, we can estimate \nthe period of occurrence of such episodes over the lifetime of an AGN: $\\sim$40,000 years.\nThis is remarkably consistent with previous studies \\citep{reynolds1997,czerny2009,kunert2010} suggesting some young radio-loud AGN to have short-lived jets operating on time scales of 10$^4$--10$^5$ years.\n\n\n\\subsection{Transient Rates}\\label{sec:summary:rate}\n\nWe searched our four-epoch dataset for transients and found only a single source in the PSC (VTC223612+001006; RSCVn) that was present in one epoch and absent in the rest.\nOur transient search was carried out over a single-epoch area of $\\sim$52 deg$^2$, but the sensitivity is not uniform across this area.\nFor the first three epochs, our transient search was conducted on single-pointing images out to a radius ($r_{\\rm max}$) of $\\sim$8\\arcmin ~from the pointing center.\nAlthough the fourth epoch has fairly uniform rms noise, the comparison with the first three epochs for transient search diminishes the significance of the added sensitivity for this epoch.\nWe can approximate the transient rate larger than a

This means that if we want to probe transient populations concentrated at \nlarge distances (redshifts), it is best to do a narrow-deep survey. \nAlso see \\cite{macquart2014} for survey parameter optimization to maximize the yield of slow transients having well-defined distributions in space.\n\n\\end{appendix}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem[Abazajian et al.

Note that the PTF limiting sensitivity of $R=21$ mag. corresponds to 12$\\mu$Jy.}.\n\nThe rates for extragalactic transients, like core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, are significantly low (Table~\\ref{tab:transients_summary}), and it is not \nsurprising that we found none of these transients in our pilot radio survey.\nSurveys over large areas of the sky are thus motivated by the search for such exotica.\nTherefore, we recommend wide-field surveys like that of the entire $\\sim$270 deg$^2$ of Stripe 82 with the Jansky VLA (the CNSS survey, which is currently underway), all-sky surveys like \nthe VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; the all-sky tier has been recently approved), or similar surveys with ASKAP, MeerKAT, and WSRT/Apertif.\nAlso, shallow radio surveys are preferred to deep surveys due to the added advantage of restricting the transient population to a low redshift space, thus making optical counterpart search feasible.\n\n{\\it\nAcknowledgemets: The authors extend sincere thanks to Joan Wrobel and other scheduling staff at the NRAO in Socorro for \nextensive help with the scheduling of the VLA observations, and to James Robnett and other computing staff \nfor their untiring assistance with the data storage and allocation of computing resources.\nThe authors also wish to thank Luis Ho, Branimir Sesar, Eran Ofek, Sanjay Bhatnagar, Urvashi Rau, Kumar Golap, Vivek Dhawan, Craig Walker, \nTalvikki Hovatta, Tim Pearson, Anthony Readhead, Chuck Steidel, and Allison Strom for insightful discussions. \nThe contribution of PTF collaboration members to optical data processing and optical follow-up observations relevant for this project is acknowledged.\nKPM is grateful to NRAO for the Grote Reber Fellowship, and to Yamini Jangir for going over this manuscript and providing useful suggestions.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for comments which helped in improving certain parts of the manuscript.\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National \nScience Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated \nUniversities, Inc.
