This blockade effect occurs over a characteristic distance scale given by the details of the atom-atom interaction.\n\nIn an atomic sample where the nearest-neighbor distance between atoms is much smaller than the blockade radius, the excitation blockade can lead to spatial ordering of the Rydberg atoms in the gas\n\\cite{Schauss27032015,PhysRevA.78.040704,PhysRevLett.98.023002,\nPhysRevLett.104.013001,PhysRevLett.109.053002,PhysRevLett.110.253003,\nPhysRevA.88.061406,PhysRevLett.114.203002}.\nA spatially-ordered atomic system has many potential applications, not only in massively parallel quantum logic, but also in probing the behavior of many-body systems, engineering synthetic gauge fields,\nenhancing fusion in high-energy-density plasmas, and generating high brightness charged particle beam sources \\cite{Comparat:10,0953-4075-45-11-113001,RevModPhys.82.2313, salpeter69,ichimaru93,\nPhysRevLett.115.214802}.\n\nThe connection between dense Rydberg systems and plasma physics is very close.\nA number of experiments have reported that dense Rydberg systems spontaneously convert\ninto plasmas \\cite{vitrant82, bergeson98b, gallagher03, walz04, vincent13, mcquillen13, lyon13, sadeghi14}.\nAlthough the initial atom temperature can be a few mK, the subsequent ion temperature\nis typically hundreds of times\nhigher because of unbalanced forces between the ions\n\\cite{PhysRevLett.110.253003,lyon11,chen04,lyon13}. This process is called disorder-induced heating (DIH),\nand it can severely limit the degree of strong coupling in the plasma.\nA plasma generated from\nan initially ordered system would circumvent disorder-induced heating, which is the largest source\nof heating in ultracold plasmas.\nThe resulting ultracold system could become a robust platform for transport and kinetic studies near the plasma/solid interface \\cite{strickler15}, with interesting applications for warm dense matter experiments \\cite{murillo07}.\nIt may be possible to generate an ordered plasma system from a cold Rydberg gas that is\nexcited in the Rydberg blockade regime \\cite{bijnen11, bannasch13, mcquillen13}.\n\nAchieving spatial order in the laboratory for mm-sized atomic samples requires careful manipulation of the many-body wavefunction. The ground state of the ordered Rydberg crystal has one excited atom surrounded by several atoms in the ground electronic state. As discussed, for example, in Ref. \\cite{0953-4075-45-11-113001}, the many-body wavefunction for $N_b$ blockaded atoms has the form $\\left|W\\right> = (N_b)^{-1/2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \\left|g_1, g_2, g_3, ..., e_i, ... g_{N}\\right>$. The adiabatic transition to this low-energy and highly-ordered state from one in which all atoms are initially in the electronic ground state requires a shaped chirped pulse \\cite{Schauss27032015,bannasch13}. However, even when the excitation pulse is not specifically tailored, blockading still occurs \\cite{tong04} and this changes the spatial distribution of excited-state atoms \\cite{Schauss27032015}.\n\nModifications in the initial nearest-neighbor distribution in an ultracold neutral plasma can lead to a significant reduction in the resulting disorder-induced heating\n\\cite{sadeghi14}. This suggests that straight-forward excitation to Rydberg states using ns-duration pulsed lasers \\cite{tong04}, followed by rapid ionization, could lead to an ultracold neutral plasma in which the ion temperature is lower than in a plasma created by direct excitation to the continuum.\n\nIn this paper, we explore the possibility of creating an ultracold neutral\nplasma with reduced temperature by exciting laser-cooled calcium atoms in a MOT to Rydberg states.\nThe conditions\nunder which blockading is expected to occur are presented. The Rydberg atom interactions lead to rapid ionization, as in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.100.043002,PhysRevA.90.022712}, as well as ion heating.\nWe report measurements of the ion velocity distribution in the plasma derived from these\ninteracting Rydberg atoms. While the blockade interaction is\ngreater than the Rabi frequency\nin portions of the atomic sample, no evidence for blockaded excitation is observed.\n\n\n\\section{Blockade discussion}\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n  \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{figure1.eps}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:level1}\n  a) Partial energy level diagram of our two-step Rydberg excitation scheme in neutral Ca.

However, the distribution falls off much more slowly when $r>\\sigma$ because the density falls off gradually and the average nearest-neighbor distance increases.\n\nIn ultracold neutral plasmas, most of the disorder-induced heating (DIH) comes from ions that are much closer to each other than the average distance. If the nearest-neighbor distribution could be suppressed at short distances, the DIH temperature would be reduced \\cite{sadeghi14}. If the initial order matched the close-packed configuration of a strongly-coupled plasma, DIH would be eliminated \\cite{lyon15b}.\n\nDepending on the experimental conditions, portions of the atomic cloud are found to be in a\nregime in which blockaded excitation is expected to occur.\nWe derive the nearest-neighbor distribution in the MOT by generating a three-dimensional random-normal distribution and computing the distance from each atom to its first nearest neighbor.\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:dist} we plot this distribution for a few different peak MOT densities.\nAlso shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:dist} are vertical lines that indicate the radius at which\nthe $U_6$ interaction energy is equal to 300 MHz for a range of principle quantum numbers.\nThis value is chosen because it matches the measured frequency width (FWHM) of our laser pulses.\nBecause the interaction energy scales as the nearest-neighbor distance to the sixth power,\natoms to the left of the vertical lines should be\nstrongly within the blockaded excitation regime.\nWe therefore expect the leading edge of the nearest-neighbor distribution\nto be suppressed in these systems \\cite{sadeghi14}.\n\n\\section{Experimental details}\n\nCalcium atoms in a thermal beam (T = 750 K) are slowed and captured into a MOT (T $\\sim$ 0.001 K). The Rydberg atoms are excited using a two-step process, as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:level1}. The first step is nearly-resonant with the 423 nm laser-cooling transition, with $\\Delta = 2\\pi \\times 150~\\mbox{MHz}$. A cw laser beam at 423 nm is pulse-amplified in a single transverse-pumped dye cell.\nAn AOM is used to turn the cw laser beam on 100 ns before the pump laser arrives at the dye cell.\nThe pump laser pulse width is 4 ns FWHM. The pulse-amplified 423 nm laser beam is expanded, apertured to a few mm diameter, attenuated, and imaged into the MOT. The resulting intensity profile is relatively flat, with $I/I_{\\rm sat} = 100$ so that the power-broadened linewidth is 350 MHz, approximately equal to the bandwidth of the laser. The corresponding\nRabi frequency for this transition is $\\Omega_1^{} = 2\\pi \\times 250~\\mbox{MHz}$.\n\nThe $4p-ns$ transition is driven using a pulse-amplified frequency-doubled ti:sapphire laser near 390 nm. An AOM is also used in this laser beam to turn the cw laser on 100 ns before the pump laser arrives at\nthe dye cell. As with the 423 nm laser, this laser is also apertured and imaged into the MOT so that the intensity is in the range of $10^9$ mW/cm$^2$. The two lasers counterpropagate each other in the MOT and arrive simultaneously. The intensity of this laser is adjusted so that the Rabi frequency ranges from 1 to 300 MHz, similar to other\nns-pulsed experiments \\cite{PhysRevLett.107.243001,kubler10}.\n\nLaser pulses with durations in the $\\sim 1~\\mu$s range are typically used in blockade experiments. Unfortunately for us, the atoms in our MOT move on the $\\mu$s time scale. At a typical density of $3\\times 10^{10}~\\mbox{cm}^{-3}$ and a temperature of 1 mK, the average time between nearest-neighbor collisions is only 2 $\\mu$s. This motion results in collisions, placing $\\mu$s-duration pulsed laser experiments in Ca outside of the ``frozen gas'' assumption used in all blockade experiments (see Fig. \\ref{fig:level1}).\nUnless the atoms are much colder or the atoms tightly confined\nto short distances, ns-duration laser pulses are required.\n\nRydberg excitation efficiency is measured using MOT loss measurements. A weak, resonant cw 423 nm laser beam passes through the MOT. When the MOT is loaded, the transmission of this laser beam is typically 1\\%. When the MOT atoms are excited to Rydberg states, they no longer interact with this laser beam and the transmission increases. Using Beer's law we are able to convert this transmission into atomic density. In a typical measurement, we measure the changes in transmission of this probe laser beam as the 390 nm laser frequency is scanned across the Rydberg excitation resonance. To avoid EIT effects, the probe laser is turned off while the excitation lasers are on.\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n  \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{figure3.eps}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:scan1}\n  Measurements of the fraction of MOT atoms excited to the $4s30s~^1S_0^{}$ state vs. the 390 nm laser frequency for a number of different laser intensities. The peak density in the MOT is $n_0 = 4\\times 10^{10}~\\mbox{cm}^{-3}$. The excited fraction is calculate based on the transmission of a weak probe laser\n  beam that passes through the MOT, in resonance with the 423 nm MOT transition.\n  As the 390 nm Rydberg excitation laser intensity increases, a greater number of atoms are excited into the Rydberg state, saturating at roughly 50\\% excitation. Increasing intensity also Stark shifts and broadens the transition. The legend indicates the Rabi frequency, $\\Omega_2 / 2\\pi$. For these measurements, $\\Omega_1^{} = 2\\pi \\times 250~\\mbox{MHz}$.\n  }\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe atomic spectroscopy is performed by offset-locking the lasers to a partially-stabilized frequency comb \\cite{lyon2014}. This provides long-term stability, accurate determinations of the absolute frequencies, and convenient frequency scanning of the lasers.\nThe comb uses a passively mode-locked ti:sapphire laser with a repetition rate, $f_{\\rm rep}^{} = 978 \\mbox{MHz}$. Its spectrum is nominally Gaussian, 35 nm FWHM, and centered at 815 nm. Without broadening, the spectrum gives strong beat notes with all of the cw lasers used in this experiment ($>25$ dB above the technical noise, 30 kHz measurement bandwidth).\nOne mode of the comb is offset-locked to a 780 nm diode laser that is itself locked to the $^{87}\\mbox{Rb}~F=2\\rightarrow F=2/3$ cross-over transition. The offset lock feeds back to the ti:sapphire laser cavity length. The absolute frequency of one comb mode is therefore known with a precision of a few kHz. The repetition rate of the laser is not controlled. However repeated measurements of the repetition rate in a 1-second measurement duration show drifts of approximately 1 Hz/s. Therefore, counting the repetition rate during our experiments allows us to determine laser frequencies with sub-MHz precision.\n\n\n\\section{Pulsed excitation measurements}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{figure4.eps}}\n  \\caption{\n  \\label{fig:analysis}\n  The fraction of MOT atoms excited to Rydberg states as a function of the principle quantum number.

The data shows increasing excitation as $\\Omega_2$ increases.\nFor excitation to this level, we expect no blockading to occur. The peak density in the MOT is $n_0 = 4\\times 10^{10}~\\mbox{cm}^{-3}$. As the $\\Omega_2$ increases, the excitation fraction grows, and the line center is Stark shifted and broadened. The signal-to-noise ratios in these data are compromised by shot-to-shot fluctuations in the excitation lasers, density fluctuations in the MOT, and by technical noise in the strongly-attenuated probe laser beam.\n\nWe have collected data like this for $n=30,40,50,60,$ and $70$. As the excitation proceeds to greater values of $n$, the lines are significantly broadened even at low excitation fractions. At $n=70$, for example, the line is broadened beyond 800 MHz.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:analysis} we plot the peak excitation fraction as a function of principle quantum number for a range of different 390 nm laser powers. For the highest laser powers, the excitation fraction never varies far from 0.5. This indicates that there is relatively little ionization or other loss on the time scale of the Rydberg excitation pulse. The highest laser power probably power-broadens the Rydberg transition so that it exceeds the $U_6$ energy. At higher values of $n$, the $ns$ and $(n-1)d$ states are only a few hundred MHz apart, and the transitions are not well separated.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{figure5.eps}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:exfrac}\n  The calculated excitation fraction in the Rydberg state after the laser pulses\n  are over for a range of values of the\n  principle quantum number (30 to 70) and a range of 390 nm laser intensities\n  (2 to $100 \\times 10^7$ mW/cm$^2$).

At higher\nvalues of the principle quantum number, the excitation fraction falls slowly.\nThis behavior is also observed for most of the other intensities, although the value of $n$\nabove which the excitation fraction falls appears to be greater at lower intensities.\n\n\\section{Monte-Carlo wavefunction calculation}\n\nTo understand the excitation process, as well as the possible influence of blockading on the excitation dynamics, we have constructed\na three-level model based on the Monte-Carlo wave function (MCWF) method \\cite{PhysRevLett.68.580,Molmer:93}.\nThis method is appropriate for calculating excitation amplitudes in the presence of radiative\ndecay.\nWe begin with a single-atom wavefunction\n$\n\\left| \\psi \\right> = a(t) \\left|g \\right> + b(t) \\left|e \\right> + c(t) \\left|r \\right>\n$\nwhere $\\left|g\\right>,\\left|e\\right>,$ and $\\left|r\\right>$ represent the $4s^1~^1S_0^{}$, $4s4p~^1P_1^{\\circ}$, and $4sns~^1S_0^{}$\nlevels and $a(t), b(t),$ and $c(t)$ are their time-dependent amplitudes.\nThe Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation is used with a rotating-wave approximation to find the time-evolution\nof the eigenstate amplitudes.\nIn the $n^{\\rm th}$ time\ninterval $dt$, these amplitudes change according to\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  dc_n & = b_{n-1} \\frac{i \\Omega_{2}}{2} dt \\nonumber \\\\\n  db_n & = a_{n-1} \\frac{i \\Omega_{1}}{2} dt + b_{n-1} \\left( -\\frac{\\Gamma}{2} - i\\Delta \\right) dt + c_{n-1} \\frac{i \\Omega_{2}}{2} dt \\nonumber \\\\\n  da_n & = b_{n-1} \\frac{i \\Omega_{1}}{2} dt ,\n  \\label{eqn:mcwf}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Gamma = 1/\\tau = (4.5~\\mbox{ns})^{-1}$ \\cite{PhysRevA.64.012508,PhysRevA.67.043408}.\nThis is equivalent to treating both transitions in a rotating frame, with each\nframe rotating independently of the other. The Rydberg state is assumed to be stable.\n\nDecay of the intermediate $\\left|e\\right>$ state is calculated probabilistically.\nIn the standard MCWF manner, we calculate a probability\n$dp_n = \\left| b_n \\right| \\Gamma dt$ and compare it\nto a random number $\\epsilon$ generated with uniform probability between 0 and 1.\nIf $\\epsilon < dp_n$, then the state $\\left|e\\right>$ has decayed and we set\nthe amplitudes $a, b,$ and $c$ to $1, 0,$ and $0$ and proceed with the calculation.\nTo ensure proper normalization, we calculate\n$(\\left|a_n \\right|^2 + \\left|b_n \\right|^2 + \\left|c_n \\right|^2)^{1/2}$ at\nevery time step and divide this into the amplitudes. Because\n$dt \\ll \\Omega_{423}^{-1}, \\Omega_{390}^{-1}$, this amplitude correction is small\nand is equivalent to the normalization method used in Refs. \\cite{PhysRevLett.68.580,Molmer:93}.\n\nThe calculated value of $\\left| c(t_{\\infty}) \\right|^2$ is plotted in Fig. \\ref{fig:exfrac}.\nThis corresponds to the probability of finding an\natom in the Rydberg state after the laser\npulses are over\nAs expected, the simulation shows the population in the Rydberg state oscillating\nat the frequency $\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\Omega_1^2 + \\Omega_2^2\\right)^{1/2}$ during\nthe laser pulse.\nThe greatest excitation\noccurs when a the pulse intensity and dipole moment produce a single $\\pi$-rotation.\n\nThe simulation in Fig. \\ref{fig:exfrac} qualitatively reproduces\nsome features observed in the experiment.\nFor example, it captures the low-amplitude excitation\nfor lower values of the principle quantum number, and increasing excitation with $n$ at a given\nlaser intensity.\nHowever, the profiles in Fig. \\ref{fig:analysis}, which correspond to horizontal\ncuts across the data in Fig. \\ref{fig:exfrac}, depend differently on laser\nintensity. The experimental data of Fig. \\ref{fig:analysis} shows that excitation\ndecreases with lower laser power. The simulation data of Fig. \\ref{fig:exfrac}\nshows that excitation \\textit{increases} with decreasing laser intensity. In the simulation,\nthis happens because the higher intensities produce multiple Rabi oscillations, resulting\nin lower overall excitation after the laser pulses are over.\n\nThese differences may be partly due to collective excitation and interactions of the Rydberg levels,\neffects that are omitted from the simulation.\nHowever, other factors may also be important. In the experiment, we observe significant shot-to-shot\nvariation in the laser power. The pulsed laser amplifiers use a multi-longitudinal-mode Nd:YAG\nlaser. The fast temporal structure in these pulses can produce broad wings in the spectral profile,\nwhereas the simulation is performed on resonance for a single frequency. Finally, interactions between\nthe Rydberg atoms beyond collective excitation could be important.\n\n\\section{Ion velocity distribution measurements}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{figure6.eps}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:delaytime}\n  A countour plot of the laser-induced fluorescence signal. The atoms are excited into\n  the state $n=50$. After a delay time ranging from 0 to 10 $\\mu$s, the 397 nm probe laser\n  is rapidly switched on. For each of these plots, the laser-induced fluorescence is\n  measured as a function of time at a given 397 nm laser frequency. Measurements are\n  repeated for a range of 397 nm laser detunings. A collection of measurements are then\n  used to produce these countour plots. The 850 nm repump laser is used to prevent\n  atoms from accumulating in the metastable state.\n  }\n\\end{figure}\n\nAfter the Rydberg atoms are created, they spontaneously ionize.\nA recent study in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.100.043002} proposed a many-atom ionization mechanism.\nIn a dense Rydberg gas, the configuration with all individual atoms in the well-defined Rydberg\nstate is not necessarily an eigenstate of the many-body system. The authors of Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.100.043002} suggest that the excited Rydberg atoms make a series of transitions to nearby excited states and\nthat some of these atoms eventually end up in the continuum.\nThis state diffusion is predicted to be the major ionization mechanism when $n=50$ at a density of $10^{11}~\\mbox{cm}^{-3}$. If the Rydberg atoms transition from the initial\nRydberg state to nearby states that are dipole-coupled, the mechanical force on the atoms can\ncollisionally ionize the atoms in the 100 ns time scale noted in their experiment. A recent simulation of\nthe experiment could not reproduce the prompt ionization of the experiment\n\\cite{PhysRevA.90.022712}. However, electron collisions\nand collisions with fast atoms were not included in the simulation. Those effects\nmay boost the ionization signal at early times.\n\nA calculation in Ref. \\cite{0953-4075-44-18-184015} suggests that the avalanche ionization\nrate per atom at a density of $4\\times 10^{10}~\\mbox{cm}^{-3}$ and a principle quantum number of\n50 is only $10^4~\\mbox{s}^{-1}$. This is far too slow to explain ionization. Direct collisional\nionization of the Rydberg atoms due to thermal motion occurs on the $\\sim1~\\mu\\mbox{s}$ time scale\n\\cite{0953-4075-38-2-024}.\n\nThe mechanical forces between Rydberg atoms has been documented in a number of publications.\nThis happens when some mechanism transfers atoms from the initial Rydberg state to some\nother state. This can occur through collisions \\cite{PhysRevLett.94.173001}, interactions\nat F\\\"{o}rster resonances or collisional resonances \\cite{PhysRevA.78.040704, Comparat:10,PhysRevLett.109.053002,PhysRevLett.94.173001},\nthrough blackbody radiation \\cite{PhysRevLett.98.023004},\nor transitions induced using microwaves\n\\cite{0953-4075-44-18-184020,PhysRevLett.115.013001,PhysRevA.84.052708}. When present, these mechanical forces will\naccelerate Rydberg atoms towards (or away from) one another. If this Rydberg gas is converted into\nan ultracold plasma, the ions will inherit the velocity distribution of the Rydberg atoms.\n\nIn our experiment, similar to Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.100.043002}, we observe a rapid rise in\nthe ion signal following excitation to Rydberg states. However, complete conversion of the\nRydberg system into a plasma seems to occur over a few microseconds.\n\nUsing laser spectroscopy, we probe the Rydberg system after it has been excited. We use a\ncw laser at 397 nm to drive the $4s-4p$ transition, as in our previous ultracold neutral plasma\nexperiments \\cite{lyon15}.\nWhen the Rydberg atoms are in states\nwith low angular momentum, this ``inner core'' excitation leads to extremely fast ionization.\nA recent study on similar states in Sr showed that the width of this\nauto-ionizing resonance is measured in THz \\cite{0953-4075-44-18-184001},\nsuggesting that autoionization occurs in less than one ps.\nThe Rydberg atom is instantly converted into an ion\nwhen the inner electron is excited. That ion initially\nhas the same velocity as the Rydberg atom. The combined motion of\nthe Rydberg atoms before ionization and also the motion of the ions after ionization\nboth contribute to the width of the laser-induced fluorescence signal at 397 nm.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:delaytime} we present contour plots of the\nion fluorescence signal as a function\nof frequency and time. In these measurements we introduce a delay between the time when the\nRydberg states are initially populated and when the 397 nm probe laser turns on. This\nprovides insight into the time-scale for transferring atoms out of the initial\nRydberg state by collisions or other mechanisms. For each of the measurements, a\nrepump laser at 850 nm is used to prevent population from accumulating in the metastable\n$d$-state (see Fig. \\ref{fig:level1}).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{figure7.eps}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:fwhmplot}\n  The measured FWHM of the data from Fig. \\ref{fig:delaytime}. The lineshapes\n  are complicated and asymmetric. However, the FWHM gives some indication of the\n  approximate velocity distribution. Atomic interactions give rise to these\n  large widths. The contour lines correspond to 90\\%, 80\\%, etc., levels of the maximum fluorescence signal in the figure.\n  }\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor time delays of 0 and 1 $\\mu$s, the fluorescence is depleted when the 397 nm laser is on\nresonance. In addition, the entire fluorescence signal vanishes in less than 10 $\\mu$s.\nFor these measurements, autoionization of Rydberg atoms\nis the dominant loss mechanism when the laser is on resonance. At later\ndelay times, the fluorescence signal is less strongly perturbed by the 397 nm laser.\nAt these times, the Rydberg atoms have been converted into ions or\ndiffused into high angular momentum states in which the 397 nm probe laser beam\ndoes not significantly perturb the velocity distribution.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:fwhmplot} we measure the FWHM as a function\nof time for all of the data in Fig. \\ref{fig:delaytime}. While it could be argued that\nthe 0 and 1 $\\mu$s data are strongly perturbed by the 397 nm laser, it appears that the longer\ndelay data are not. The width of the fluorescence signal rises to several\nhundred MHz, corresponding to velocities on the order of 200 m/s. This occurs with\nand without the presence of the 397 nm laser. The nearly linear rise\nin the fluorescence width indicates that the ion acceleration is approximately $4\\times 10^7$ m/s$^2$.\n\nThe central question in this investigation is whether or not the excitation of the Rydberg atoms\nis blockaded by the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction, and\nif that blockaded excitation would lead to a spatial ordered\nRydberg system. The primary manifestation of that blockading\nand ordering\nshould be the slow expansion of the plasma. Data previously published by us\non the expansion of ultracold neutral plasmas\nshows characteristic post-DIH broadening of the velocity distribution\nof roughly $2\\times 10^7$ m/s$^2$ \\cite{lyon13}, depending on electron temperature.\nThis value is same order of magnitude as the value derived from Fig. \\ref{fig:fwhmplot}.\nWe therefore must conclude that the Rydberg blockade is likely not\nsignificant in these data.\n\nIt is possible that blockading and ordering is present but that it is masked by some other effect.\nThe plasma expansion is driven by the electrons. Anything that heats the electrons\nwill contribute to faster plasma expansion.\nEnergy-pooling collisions between free electrons and excited-state ions and\nauto-ionization from the excited inner-shell electron, for example,\ncould contribute significantly to electron heating.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have explored evidences of blockaded Rydberg excitation of laser-cooled\nCa atoms in a MOT\nusing ns-duration laser pulses. The energy scales set by the\nRabi frequency and the $U_6$ interaction seem to be appropriate for blockaded excitation and spatial ordering\nin portions of the atom sample. However, our velocity measurements\nprovide no indication that this effect is present.\n\nThe presence of charged particles in our MOT would prevent realization of the blockade.\nIt is possible that the transition from a Rydberg atom to an ion occurs on time scales shorter\nthan the 4 ns laser pulse. Under certain conditions, we measure ions emitted from our MOT.\nWe have minimized these in the present work by applying a constant electric field until 100 ns\nbefore the laser pulse arrives, effectively sweeping all charged particles from the MOT\nwhen the Rydberg excitation occurs.\n\nIt is also possible that blockaded excitation occurs, but that the initial Rydberg state is\nrapidly scrambled by interactions with other particles. This would lead to large mechanical forces,\nas mentioned previously, that could produce ions rapidly.\n\nIt would be better to excite these Rydberg atoms using a longer laser pulse, perhaps 50 ns in duration\nwith a smooth temporal profile. Such an excitation pulse would place less stringent constraints\non the Rabi frequency. One could even imagine tailoring the frequency and intensity of\nsuch a laser pulse. However, all laser issues aside, the uncontrolled nearest-neighbor distribution\nin a MOT would undoubtedly complicate the blockade mechanism, producing an uncontrolled\nnumber of Rabi cycles and resulting\nin low excitation probability (see Fig. \\ref{fig:exfrac}) and weak blockading.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\n\nThis research is supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (Grant No. FA9950-12-0308)\nand by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. PHY-1404488).\n\n\n\n\\providecommand{\\newblock}{}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname url\\endcsname\\relax\n  \\def\\url#1{{\\tt #1}}\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname urlprefix\\endcsname\\relax\\def\\urlprefix{URL }\\fi\n\\providecommand{\\eprint}[2][]{\\url{#2}}\n\n\n\n\\bibitem{PhysRevLett.85.2208}\nJaksch D, Cirac J~I, Zoller P, Rolston S~L, C\\^ot\\'e R and Lukin M~D 2000 {\\em\n  Phys.
