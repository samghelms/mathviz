Indeed its band gap can cover the whole solar spectrum, including the visible region, solely by changing the Indium composition \\cite{bechstedt_energy_2003,reichertz_demonstration_2009,fabien_guidelines_2014}. The InGaN alloy also counts among its advantages relatively low effective mass and high mobilities for electrons and holes \\cite{hsu_modeling_2008}, a high absorption coefficient \\cite{wu_band_2003,polyakov_low-field_2006,jani_design_2007}  as well as a good radiation tolerance \\cite{wu_superior_2003}, allowing its operation in extreme conditions.\n\n\nHowever, the main drawbacks are the poor InGaN crystal quality, the difficulty to grow InGaN with Indium content covering the interesting range for solar application \\cite{yamamoto_metal-organic_2013}, the difficulty of p-type doping mainly due to the high residual donors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concentration and the lack of \\emph{ad. hoc.} acceptors \\cite{dahal_ingan/gan_2009}, and the difficulty to realize ohmic contacts on p-doped layers  \\cite{jani_development_2008}. For these reasons the InGaN based solar cell is still in early development stages and the reported photovoltaic efficiency is still very low to be competitive with other well established III-V and silicon technologies  \\cite{toledo_ingan_2012}. It is then vital to leverage these drawbacks and to develop alternative technologies. One possible paths could be the Schottky technology. This technology is largely used elsewhere in the III-Nitride based power devices and photodetectors \\cite{saito_group_2009} but is very new to the InGaN photovoltaic technology. The first experimental work was published in 2009 by Xue Jun-Jun  \\cite{jun-jun_au/pt/ingan/gan_2009}. The prototype developed by this team demonstrates the feasibility of such a concept: an optimization work becomes necessary in order to evaluate precisely and realistically the potentialities of this device. Some work has recently been done in that direction \\cite{mahala_metal/ingan_2015}, using simplifying assumptions in order to pursue an analytical approach.\n\n\nThat is the reason why we propose, in this report and for the first time using a comprehensive numerical method, a detailed study of the potentialities of the InGaN Schottky technology as a viable alternative to the InGaN p-n junction solar cell.\nWe used mathematical algorithms to study this new solar cell where usual approaches use one-by-one parametric analysis which is inherently inexact and quite tedious. Our mathematical optimization approach is novel in the area of solar cell devices, though relatively common in other applied physics areas such as mechanical engineering.\n\nThe following section describes the physical modeling of the InGaN Schottky solar cell structure and discusses its main adjustable parameters. The second section presents the detailed optimized results and a device analysis with respect to the main cell parameters.\n\n\\section{Schottky Solar Cell Modeling}\n\n\\subsection{Physical Modeling}\n\nThe InGaN Schottky solar cell schematic view is shown on Figure \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig1}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig1.pdf}\n  \\caption{InGaN solar cell device structure.}\n  \\label{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe here proposed device could be realized in practice using the conventional growth of InGaN on insulating substrates such as sapphire \\cite{matsuoka_progress_2005} or Fe compensated GaN. To further ensure practical realization, we propose a coplanar device metalization.\n\n Modeling this device implies taking into account the interactions of the basic transport equations, including the Poisson and continuity equations on electrons and holes. In this model, the current densities need to be calculated including both the drift and diffusion components.\n\nTwo of the main key parameters are the mobilities of electrons and holes. Their values can be deduced from temperature and doping using the Caughey-Thomas expressions \\cite{schwierz_electron_2005}:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq_mobility}\n  \\mu_m=\\mu_{1m}\\left(\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\alpha_m}+\\frac{\\mu_{2m}\\left(\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\beta_m}- \\mu_{1m}\\left(\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\alpha_m}}{1+\\left(\\frac{N}{N_m^{\\mathrm{crit}}\\left(\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\gamma_m}}\\right)^{\\delta_m}}\n,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mu_{m}=\\mu_{1m}\\left(\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\alpha_{m}}+\\frac{\\mu_{2m}\\left(%&#10;\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\beta_{m}}-\\mu_{1m}\\left(\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\alpha_{m%&#10;}}}{1+\\left(\\frac{N}{N_{m}^{\\mathrm{crit}}\\left(\\frac{T}{300}\\right)^{\\gamma_{%&#10;m}}}\\right)^{\\delta_{m}}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>T</mi><mn>300</mn></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>T</mi><mn>300</mn></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b2</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>T</mi><mn>300</mn></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></msup></mrow></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>N</mi><mrow><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>crit</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>T</mi><mn>300</mn></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b4</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05951.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nThe electron and holes mobility must be paid here a special attention:  the linear interpolation of the parameters included in equation \\eqref{eq_mobility} implies that the mobility itself is \\emph{not} interpolated in a linear way.\n\nModeling the Schottky solar cell implies also the need for a detailed model of light absorption in the whole solar spectrum and for all $x$ Indium composition.

These equations are solved in a two-dimensional framework.\n\nFor any given set of physical and geometrical parameters, {Atlas$^{\\text{\\textregistered}}$\\xspace} solves the model equations and outputs a whole set of data, including the current-voltage curve, the photocurrent spectral response, the electrical field distribution, the recombination variation, and the photovoltaic parameters among which can be found the short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage, the fill factor and the conversion efficiency.\n\nDoing a careful optimization of the above described solar cell implies to define precisely the optimization goal and the parameters that will be set as free and looked for, leaving the others as simple data to the problem. This is a strategic choice because it will deeply impact the optimization method and strategy able to solve the problem.\n\nOn the one hand, the choice of the figure of merit that will be maximized is crucial, as it will be the one and only factor that will be maximized. Its quantitative evaluation thus needs to be as quick and precise as can be. We chose here to maximize the conversion efficiency of the cell, as it can be evaluated from the data provided by {Atlas$^{\\text{\\textregistered}}$\\xspace}.\n\nOn the other hand, setting a large number of parameters as free surely increases the chances of getting the best merit factor possible, but as surely increases the problem difficulty and thus the computing time.\n\nIn the above described Schottky solar cell, we need to identify the two sets of relevant physical and geometrical parameters, that can be tuned and which have a significant impact on the cell behavior. In these two sets, we will strategically chose the parameters we will look for and those which are to be set as constant data.\n\nIn the geometrical set are to be found the cell width, length and height. The latter is the sum of the InGaN layer thickness and that of the metal electrodes used for the Schottky contact. The width and length of the cell define the cell area. We do here the simplifying assumptions that the results we will get are independent of the cell area, at least as far as the conversion efficiency is concerned. This area is thus arbitrarily set to a $\\mathrm{1\\mu m^2}$ square.\n\nWe have chosen to set the metal layer thickness to $5\\mathrm{nm}$ and included in the simulation the work function as a variable parameter. Indeed, once the metal is chosen according to its work function, the optimization of the metal layer mainly requires geometrical considerations, such as interdigited electrodes, which is not within the scope of this analysis.\n\nThe InGaN absorbing layer thickness plays a significant role and we have chosen to let it be a free parameter for which we seek the optimum value.\n\nThe InGanN layer physical parameters that can be tuned and that have a significant impact on the cell behavior include its n-type doping and its Indium composition. We have chosen to let both of them be free parameters in order to find their optimum values.\n\nSummarizing, the four free parameters are thus the Indium composition and the metal work function, along with the doping and the thickness of the n-type layer.\n\nFinally, we have chosen to shine on the cell the ASTM-G75-03 solar spectrum taken from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory database \\footnote{\\url{http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/astmg173/astmg173.html}}.\n\n\\subsection{Parameters ranges and normalization}\n\nAs described above, the optimization task we have now to undertake is the optimization of the cell efficiency $\\eta$, which is a function of four parameters, the InGaN layer thickness, the n-type doping, the Indium composition and the metal work function.\n\nThese parameters must however be constrained within a variation domain, which is the interval in which they are meaningful in physical and technological terms. The Indium composition is ${x}$ in $\\mathrm{In_xGa_{1-x}N}$ and will vary in the whole range: ${x}\\in\\left[0, 1\\right]$.\n\nThe metal work function ${W_f}$ is to be constrained roughly between the minimum and maximum work functions of existing and usable metals and alloys. We chose to constrain it between $5.1$ and $6.3 \\mathrm{eV}$ : ${W_f}\\in\\left[5.1, 6.3\\right]$.\n\nThe InGaN layer n-type doping ${N_d}$ was chosen between the minimal residual N doping of $10^{16}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Its maximum value was, on its side, a large $10^{19}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ if experimental data are considered. We get ${N_d}\\in\\left[10^{16}, 10^{19}\\right]\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n\nThe last parameter we have to set bounds for is the the InGaN layer thickness ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}$. We chose to set its minimum value to a $100\\mathrm{nm}$ thickness which ensures that a significant part of the wavelengths included in the solar spectrum are absorbed \\cite{brown_finite_2010}. Its maximum was set to a large $1\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, obtaining ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}\\in\\left[0.1, 1\\right]\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n\nFinally, the state-of-the-art optimizer will treat the parameters as dimensionless quantities. Therefore, in order for the general optimizing algorithm to work as expected, all the parameters should have similar variation range. This is easily obtained for ${x}$, ${W_f}$ and ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}$ by normalizing them to their maximum, and using this normalized values as the actual parameters.\n\nThe case of ${N_d}$ is trickier. If we applied the same procedure, the algorithm would focus on the highest dopings, namely the last decade, which is something we want to avoid. The actually meaningful quantity is the $\\log\\left({N_d}\\right)$. We chose the actual parameter for the n-type doping to be $\\log_{10}\\left({N_d}\\right)$ and normalized it to its maximum value of $19$.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the results presented in the following will be un-normalized, though the actual computation has indeed been done with the normalized parameters.\n\n\\subsection{Optimization}\n\nThe mathematical problem we must now solve is a bounded non linear optimization problem. In other words, we need to find the optimum quadruplet $\\left({x},{W_f},{N_d},{T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}\\right)$ within the four dimension hypercube\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13191, "prevtext": "\n\n\nwhere $E_{ph}$ is the incoming photon energy and $E_g$ is the material band gap at a given Indium composition.\nOnce $C$ and $D$ are known for a given Indium composition, the above equation \\eqref{eq_absorption} yields the absorption coefficient for the whole solar spectrum.\n\nThe values for $C$ and $D$ are again taken from the experimental measurement reported in \\cite{brown_finite_2010} and summarized in Table \\ref{tab_Brown}.

Indeed, at a given Indium composition, the increase of the metal work function widens the space charge region and increases the electric field amplitude, as shown in Fig. \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig4}. All other things being equal, this increases the overall solar cell efficiency. This increase is mainly due to a higher open-circuit voltage and, to a lesser extent, to a better fill factor, as shown in Fig. \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig6}.\n\nWhen the Indium composition is increased for a given metal work function, the whole set of the active layer parameters changes, including the  absorption spectrum and the band gap, this latter decreasing.\nThis decrease of the band gap and the linked change of the absorption spectrum enhances the solar light absorption in the visible range and thus the photovoltaic performances.\n\nThese better performances are due to the fact that the short-circuit current increases sharply, owing to a higher photogeneration and higher quantum efficiency. Meanwhile, the open-circuit voltage decreases as the metal/InGaN barrier height decreases.\n\nWhen the Indium composition becomes higher than a certain limit, depending on the metal work function, the overall efficiency decreases and, ultimately, becomes non significant at a given Indium composition, as can be seen on Fig. \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig3}. The optimal Indium composition is fixed on the one hand by the matching between the solar spectrum and the InGaN absorption spectrum (and thus the band gap) and, on the other hand, by the quantum efficiency directly impacted by the metal/InGaN barrier height through the space charge region thickness and the electric field magnitude.\n\nThe resulting highest efficiency is $18.2\\%$ obtained for an Indium composition of $0.56$ and a metal work function of $6.3 \\mathrm{eV}$. The active layer thickness is $0.86\\mathrm{\\mu m}$. This efficiency is comparable to the efficiency of the well-established thin-films solar cells \\cite{green_solar_2015} and could make this new technology highly competitive for the photovoltaic industry since the fabrication cost is expected to be relatively low. Indeed, its extremely simple one-semiconductor-layer makes it more cost effective to fabricate than current conventional multi-layer and/or he\\-te\\-ros\\-truc\\-tu\\-re pho\\-to\\-vol\\-ta\\-ic cells \\cite{cho_influence_2012}. In addition, its fabrication technology is comparable to that of commercially available InGaN LEDs, even though the Indium composition that is necessary for photovoltaic applications is still the goal of much research work \\cite{fischer_highly_2013,yong_structural_2014}. However, should we allow a maximum composition of $40\\%$, Fig. \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig2} shows that the efficiency would remain around $13\\%$. \n\nSimilarly, the same Fig. \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig2} shows that lowering the work function to $6.0 \\mathrm{eV}$ does not impair the efficiency that much. Furthermore, the literature accounts for measurements of the work function of Platinum as high as $6.35 \\mathrm{eV}$ \\cite{chen_effect_2007,haridas_effect_2011,dubridge1928photoelectric}, close enough to the theoretical optimum, as seen on the same figure \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig2}.\n\nHowever, some measurements in the literature report a lower work function for Platinum: $5.65 \\mathrm{eV}$ can for instance be found in ref. \\cite{rotermund1990investigation}, $5.93 \\mathrm{eV}$ in ref. \\cite{book2008work} and $6.10 \\mathrm{eV}$ in ref. \\cite{derry1989work}\\footnote{Are cited here only the most cited values of the Platinum work function.}.\nWe thus performed a full optimization by keeping only the work function constant and equal to each of these widely cited experimental work function values. For a Platinum work function of $5.65 \\mathrm{eV}$ (as reported, e.g., in \\cite{rotermund1990investigation}), the efficiency decreases to $\\approx 7.7\\%$ obtained for layer thickness of $1.68 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$, layer doping of $3.7\\times10^{15}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and Indium composition of $0.48$. The Indium composition decreases as expected to maximize the effective barrier height. Indeed, Lowering the metal work function should be accompanied with a lowering of the active layer affinity and thus a decrease in the Indium composition. But since the Indium composition impacts all other parameters (e.g. absorption spectrum) the overall cell efficiency will change accordingly. For a Platinum work function of $5.93 \\mathrm{eV}$ (as reported, e.g., in \\cite{book2008work}), the obtained optimal efficiency is $\\approx 13.9\\%$ obtained for layer thickness of $1.65 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$, doping of $8\\times10^{15}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and Indium composition of $0.58$. For a Platinum work function of $6.10 \\mathrm{eV}$ (as reported, e.g., by \\cite{derry1989work}), an optimal efficiency of $\\approx 17\\%$ was obtained for layer thickness of $1.16 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$, doping of $1.54\\times10^{16}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and Indium composition of $0.57$. The here obtained value is very close to the optimal one ($18.2\\%$).\n\nThe thickness needed is $0.86\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ to achieve the highest efficiency ($18.2\\%$). Should the InGaN thickness be $0.3\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, the corresponding efficiency would be $14.5\\%$. Should it be $0.2\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, the efficiency would only decrease to $12.5\\%$, remaining comparable to the efficiency of standard thin-films solar cells \\cite{green_solar_2015}. The proposed solar cell could then be realized with very thin InGaN layer, down to a $200\\mathrm{nm}$ thickness.\n\nThis latter has at least two advantages. One of them is to drastically minimize the quantity of precursors needed to elaborate the active layer, usually using Metalorganic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD). The other advantage is the possibility to elaborate high quality pseudomorphic layers. \n\nFinally, the optimal doping of the n-layer is comparable to the residual concentration usually measured for this alloy, possibly removing the need for additional doping.\n\n\\subsection{Bandgap Bowing Impact}\n\\label{bowing}\n\nThe literature exhibits a quite large consensus around the $b=1.43$ value of the bowing parameter \\cite{wu_band_2003,fabien_guidelines_2014} used in this work, for thicknesses comparable to ours and corresponding to relaxed layer in the whole composition range. However theoretical \\emph{ab initio} calculations \\cite{moses_band_2010} cast some doubt on the very validity of the unique quadratic approximation for the whole composition range. In other words, the bowing factor could depend on the Indium composition.\n\nThese uncertainties on the bowing parameter actual value for relaxed layers lead us to propose here the quantitative value of the optimized parameters of the Schottky solar cell for another value of the bowing factor, $b=3.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, as suggested by \\emph{ab initio} calculations made by \\cite{moses_band_2010}.\n\nFor this bowing factor value of $b=3.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, the optimum cell efficiency is $17.8\\%$ for the following parameters : $({x},$ ${W_f},$ ${N_d},$ ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}})=$ $\\left(0.44,6.3\\mathrm{eV},8.81\\times10^{16}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}},0.89\\mathrm{\\mu m}\\right)$. It is only slightly lower than the value of $18.2\\%$ that has been calculated previously for $b=1.43 \\mathrm{eV}$.\nFurthermore, the optimal composition value $x$ that is retrieved is lower than previously, as could be expected to keep the optimal band gap energy. The other parameters are similar.\n\n\\subsection{Interfacial Layer Effect}\n\\label{interfaciallayer}\n\nThe contact metal to III-Nitride layer is known to possibly exhibit thin interfacial layer which can be due to particle irradiation, thermal treatment such as annealing, diffusion, crystal polarization or surface defects \\cite{jang2006schottky}. This can be modeled as the creation of a thin interfacial highly doped layer with a typical doping concentration around $10^{19}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ when intentionally induced by high energy particle irradiation \\cite{li2005fermi} and around $5\\times10^{18}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ when due to native defects \\cite{mamor2009interface}. We thus added in our model a 5 nm $n^+$ layer in between the n-doped layer and the metal and made calculations for the interfacial layer doping density varying from $1\\times10^{17}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ to $1\\times10^{20}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. This last maximum value is one order of magnitude higher than the value intentionally induced by particle irradiation in \\cite{li2005fermi}. We have however included this extreme value in the simulations to give an insight on what would happen then.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig7.pdf}\n  \\caption{Efficiency as a function of the interfacial layer doping concentration, for a metal work function ${W_f}=6.3\\mathrm{eV}$, an Indium composition of ${x}=0.56$, a doping of ${N_d}=6.5\\times10^{16}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and an InGaN layer thickness of ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}=0.86\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.}\n  \\label{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig7}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig. \\ref{SchottkInGaN_rev_Fig7} shows the efficiency variation with the interfacial layer doping. This efficiency, obtained for the optimal parameters $\\left({x},{W_f},{N_d},{T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}\\right)$ $=\\left(0.56,6.3\\mathrm{eV},6.5\\times10^{16}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}},0.86\\mathrm{\\mu m}\\right)$, remains almost unchanged for dopings below $4\\times10^{19}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and decreases down to $11.25\\%$ for an extreme doping value of $5 \\times10^{19}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. For the very high $1\\times10^{20}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ doping concentration, the efficiency dramatically decreases to less than $1.0\\%$.\nThe threshold effect, observed at the value of $4 \\times10^{19}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, is induced by the $n^+-n$ junction contribution, at these very high interfacial doping levels. It indeed impacts the overall solar cell I-V characteristic, resulting in a rapid decrease of the fill factor which is brought down from $79\\%$ to $54\\%$ when the $n^+$ doping concentration increases from $1\\times10^{19}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ to $5\\times10^{19}\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ as shown in table \\ref{tabinterfacial}.\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n${ {{N^+}}^{(\\mathrm{ {cm^{-3}}})}  }$ & ${{1}\\times10^{{19}}}$ & ${{3}\\times10^{{19}}}$ & ${{5}\\times10^{{19}}}$ \\\\ \\hline\n${ {{JSC}}^{(\\mathrm{ {mA/cm^{2}}})}  }$ & 23.34 & 23.07 & 22.63 \\\\ \\hline\n${ {{VOC}}^{(\\mathrm{ {V}})}  }$ & 0.96 & 0.97 & 0.92 \\\\ \\hline\n${ {{FF}}^{(\\mathrm{ {\\%}})}  }$ & 79.2 & 79.0 & 54.04 \\\\ \\hline\n${ {{\\eta}}^{(\\mathrm{ {\\%}})}  }$ & 17.74 & 17.67 & 11.25 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\caption{Short-Circuit Current ${JSC}$, Open-Circuit Voltage ${VOC}$, Fill Factor FF and Efficiency ${\\eta}$ for some interfacial layer doping concentrations, for a metal work function ${W_f}=6.3\\mathrm{eV}$, an Indium composition of ${x}=0.56$, a doping of ${N_d}=6.5\\times10^{16}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and an InGaN layer thickness of ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}=0.86\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\\label{tabinterfacial}}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have studied, by using mathematical optimization methods, the new InGaN Schottky solar cell. We have applied sophisticated optimization algorithms, for the first time to our knowledge, to the study of InGaN based solar cells. This has allowed to demonstrate the usefulness of such an approach to the study of novel solar cells, compared to the classical parametric analysis. Using the most realistic physical parameters, obtained from previously published experimental papers, we obtained a maximum conversion efficiency of $18.2\\%$ for the InGaN Schottky solar cell. The demonstrated figure of merit of the simulated InGaN Schottky solar cell, the realistic parameters set and the expected elaboration simplicity make the InGaN Schottky solar cell an attractive alternative to the usual InGaN p-n and p-i-n junction solar cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\\bibliographystyle{elsarticle-num} \n\\bibliography{SchottkInGaN_rev_Ref}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\nwith $A$ and $B$ experimentally measured \\cite{nawaz_tcad-based_2012,brown_finite_2010} for GaN ($A^{\\mathrm{GaN}}=13.55$ and $B^{\\mathrm{GaN}}=2.05$) and InN ($B^{\\mathrm{InN}}=2.05$ and $B ^{\\mathrm{InN}}=3.03$) and linearly interpolated for InGaN.\n\n\\par{Finally, we chose not to include the spontaneous polarization effect in our Schottky one-active-layer design as we expect its impact to be more sensitive in the more complex designs such as GaN/InGaN multijunction solar cells where it can negatively impact the solar cell efficiency or, on the contrary, enhance the efficiency \\cite{lestrade2011modeling, thosar2013modeling}.}\n\n\n\\subsection{Optimization parameters}\n\\label{optimparameters}\n\nThe device is simulated in the framework of a drift-diffusion model using the {Atlas$^{\\text{\\textregistered}}$\\xspace} device simulation framework from the commercial {Silvaco$^{\\text{\\textregistered}}$\\xspace} software suite.\nThese pieces of software solve the above described non linear partial differential problem using the Newton-Raphson direct and the Gummel iterative methods \\cite{kramer_semiconductor_1997}. These equations are solved in a two-dimensional framework.\n\nFor any given set of physical and geometrical parameters, {Atlas$^{\\text{\\textregistered}}$\\xspace} solves the model equations and outputs a whole set of data, including the current-voltage curve, the photocurrent spectral response, the electrical field distribution, the recombination variation, and the photovoltaic parameters among which can be found the short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage, the fill factor and the conversion efficiency.\n\nDoing a careful optimization of the above described solar cell implies to define precisely the optimization goal and the parameters that will be set as free and looked for, leaving the others as simple data to the problem. This is a strategic choice because it will deeply impact the optimization method and strategy able to solve the problem.\n\nOn the one hand, the choice of the figure of merit that will be maximized is crucial, as it will be the one and only factor that will be maximized. Its quantitative evaluation thus needs to be as quick and precise as can be. We chose here to maximize the conversion efficiency of the cell, as it can be evaluated from the data provided by {Atlas$^{\\text{\\textregistered}}$\\xspace}.\n\nOn the other hand, setting a large number of parameters as free surely increases the chances of getting the best merit factor possible, but as surely increases the problem difficulty and thus the computing time.\n\nIn the above described Schottky solar cell, we need to identify the two sets of relevant physical and geometrical parameters, that can be tuned and which have a significant impact on the cell behavior. In these two sets, we will strategically chose the parameters we will look for and those which are to be set as constant data.\n\nIn the geometrical set are to be found the cell width, length and height. The latter is the sum of the InGaN layer thickness and that of the metal electrodes used for the Schottky contact. The width and length of the cell define the cell area. We do here the simplifying assumptions that the results we will get are independent of the cell area, at least as far as the conversion efficiency is concerned. This area is thus arbitrarily set to a $\\mathrm{1\\mu m^2}$ square.\n\nWe have chosen to set the metal layer thickness to $5\\mathrm{nm}$ and included in the simulation the work function as a variable parameter. Indeed, once the metal is chosen according to its work function, the optimization of the metal layer mainly requires geometrical considerations, such as interdigited electrodes, which is not within the scope of this analysis.\n\nThe InGaN absorbing layer thickness plays a significant role and we have chosen to let it be a free parameter for which we seek the optimum value.\n\nThe InGanN layer physical parameters that can be tuned and that have a significant impact on the cell behavior include its n-type doping and its Indium composition. We have chosen to let both of them be free parameters in order to find their optimum values.\n\nSummarizing, the four free parameters are thus the Indium composition and the metal work function, along with the doping and the thickness of the n-type layer.\n\nFinally, we have chosen to shine on the cell the ASTM-G75-03 solar spectrum taken from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory database \\footnote{\\url{http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/astmg173/astmg173.html}}.\n\n\\subsection{Parameters ranges and normalization}\n\nAs described above, the optimization task we have now to undertake is the optimization of the cell efficiency $\\eta$, which is a function of four parameters, the InGaN layer thickness, the n-type doping, the Indium composition and the metal work function.\n\nThese parameters must however be constrained within a variation domain, which is the interval in which they are meaningful in physical and technological terms. The Indium composition is ${x}$ in $\\mathrm{In_xGa_{1-x}N}$ and will vary in the whole range: ${x}\\in\\left[0, 1\\right]$.\n\nThe metal work function ${W_f}$ is to be constrained roughly between the minimum and maximum work functions of existing and usable metals and alloys. We chose to constrain it between $5.1$ and $6.3 \\mathrm{eV}$ : ${W_f}\\in\\left[5.1, 6.3\\right]$.\n\nThe InGaN layer n-type doping ${N_d}$ was chosen between the minimal residual N doping of $10^{16}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Its maximum value was, on its side, a large $10^{19}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ if experimental data are considered. We get ${N_d}\\in\\left[10^{16}, 10^{19}\\right]\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n\nThe last parameter we have to set bounds for is the the InGaN layer thickness ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}$. We chose to set its minimum value to a $100\\mathrm{nm}$ thickness which ensures that a significant part of the wavelengths included in the solar spectrum are absorbed \\cite{brown_finite_2010}. Its maximum was set to a large $1\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, obtaining ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}\\in\\left[0.1, 1\\right]\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n\nFinally, the state-of-the-art optimizer will treat the parameters as dimensionless quantities. Therefore, in order for the general optimizing algorithm to work as expected, all the parameters should have similar variation range. This is easily obtained for ${x}$, ${W_f}$ and ${T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}$ by normalizing them to their maximum, and using this normalized values as the actual parameters.\n\nThe case of ${N_d}$ is trickier. If we applied the same procedure, the algorithm would focus on the highest dopings, namely the last decade, which is something we want to avoid. The actually meaningful quantity is the $\\log\\left({N_d}\\right)$. We chose the actual parameter for the n-type doping to be $\\log_{10}\\left({N_d}\\right)$ and normalized it to its maximum value of $19$.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the results presented in the following will be un-normalized, though the actual computation has indeed been done with the normalized parameters.\n\n\\subsection{Optimization}\n\nThe mathematical problem we must now solve is a bounded non linear optimization problem. In other words, we need to find the optimum quadruplet $\\left({x},{W_f},{N_d},{T_{\\mathrm{InGaN}}}\\right)$ within the four dimension hypercube\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\[\\left[0,1\\right]\\times\\left[5.1,6.3\\right]eV\\times[10^{16},10^{19}]\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}\\times\\left[0.1,1\\right]\\mathrm{\\mu m}\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\left[0,1\\right]\\times\\left[5.1,6.3\\right]eV\\times[10^{16},10^{19}]\\mathrm{cm^%&#10;{-3}}\\times\\left[0.1,1\\right]\\mathrm{\\mu m}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mn>5.1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>6.3</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>16</mn></msup><mo>,</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>19</mn></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>cm</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mn>0.1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
