This was done using atomic data provided by Storey \\& Hummer\n(1995) with the recombination line intensities for case B (opaque nebula), $T_{e}$ = 15\\,000 K, $n_{e} = 10^{8}-10^{10}\\, {\\rm cm}^{-3}$.\nThe accounted Balmer emission lines covered excitation top level for the transitions in the range $10 \\leq n \\leq 50$.\n\n\\subsection{Accretion disk model of the broad band spectrum}\n\nFor the description of the accretion disk emission we use the model {\\sc optxagnf} developed by Done\net al. (2012) for the purpose of modeling NLS1, and implemented in XSPEC (Arnaud 1996). This phenomenological model well represents the complexity of the disk emission. Bare disk in this model is seen for radii larger than $R_{cor}$, and the inner disk region is covered by the disk corona. The local disk emission is color-corrected using the approximations given in Done et al. (2012). Inside $R_{cor}$, part of the energy is dissipated in the corona. Two thermal Comptonization media are necessary. Low temperature Comptonization is necessary to model the soft X-ray excess. This soft Comptonization is described by the electron temperature, $T_e$, and the optical depth, $\\tau$, and implemented in XSPEC as {\\sc comptt} (Titarchuk 1994). The second Comptonization has to reproduce the power law emission which dominates above 2 keV. This high temperature component is described by {\\sc nthcomp} (Zdziarski et al. 1996), and parameterized by the hard X-ray slope, $\\Gamma$, and the fraction of energy, $f_{pl}$, dissipated in the hard X-ray emitting corona, while the temperature of the hot coronal phase is fixed at 100 keV. The soft part of the corona may physically correspond to an optically thick skin on the top of the disk, and it is likely strongly magnetized (R\\' o\\. za\\' nska et al. 2015).\n\nInput parameters of the model are the black hole mass, $M_{BH}$, black hole spin, $a$, bolometric Eddington ratio, $L/L_{\\rm Edd}$, $R_{cor}$,  $T_e$, $\\tau$, $\\Gamma$, $f_{pl}$,  the comoving (proper) distance of the source, and redshift. \n\n\\section{Fitting methods}\n\\label{sect:fitting}\n\nThe model contains numerous free parameters,  and 45 of those are normalizations of different starlight components in the STARLIGHT code. Since we use this special code for starlight fitting, based on very efficient Monte Carlo Markoff Chain method, while X-ray data fitting with XSPEC has also its complexity, we divided the fitting procedure in two parts which are done independently, and the global solution is obtained through iterations between the two parts.\n\nWe first model the optical/UV part. This approach has also the advantage of giving results directly comparable to Bian \\& Huang (2010). \n\nIn that part we (temporarily) replace the disk component with the power law, as in Bian \\& Huang (2010). We subtract Fe II emission and Balmer continuum from the data, using a dense grid of the normalizations of these components, and then we run the  STARLIGHT code with a pre-set power law slope to get the starlight shape given by 45 normalizations of the components, the systematic stellar velocity, stellar velocity dispersion and the reddening. The resulting $\\chi^2$  is used to select the best fit solution. Regions of the strong BLR emissions are masked and do not contribute to the fit quality.  The gap between the SDSS and HST data is masked as well, and the shift in the HST data is allowed.\n\nHaving the initial decomposition of the optical/UV spectrum, we subtract the starlight, Fe II and Balmer continuum from the original data. We are then left with the disk component. In principle, we could just use the power law from the best fit model as the disk representation in the optical/UV part but the power law is not a perfect representation of the disk shape due to the radius-dependent color correction. \n\nThe number of data points is much higher in optical/UV band (5401) than in the X-ray band (109), despite masking the strong emission line regions. Without binning, this would lead to a strong dependence of disk fitting on the optical/UV part where the disk contribution is actually very minor in most part of the spectrum. We thus bin the optical/UV points representing the disk contribution, with the gaps retained, as in the optical/UV data fitting. Gaps are then ignored in the broad band fitting (including X-rays).  \n\nFor the errors in the resulting data points we take the statistical errors derived from the initial errors in the spectrum, but we also include the systematic errors. Binning reduces the statistical errors down to very small values. On the other hand, the disk component is formed by subtraction of the very complex model from the original data. Although the fit is generally reasonable, it is not perfect, and some systematic patterns are clearly visible in the residuals. They bias the small expected disk contribution significantly. We thus used additional systematic error ingredient in the disk component fitting procedure. In order to account for generally higher data quality in the optical band and lower in the UV part, we assumed that this systematic error in the original data set is of the type $A(1000/\\lambda)$. The normalization A was determined by assumption that the best fit of the full model described above should give the reduced $\\chi^2$ equal 1 (without it, it is about 1.3). In this way we obtained the value $A = 2.0 \\times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-1}$. When subsequently we bin the data, the statistical error is reduced, but we retain this systematic error for the disk component.\n\nWe then combine the resulting opt/UV spectrum representing the disk emission with long XMM observation and perform the disk fitting using the model {\\sc optxagnf} from XSPEC package. The best fit accretion disk model is again selected by minimizing the $\\chi^2$. From this broad band fit we obtain new approximation for the disk contribution to the optical/UV band which is not of a power law shape, mostly due to the color-correction to the disk emission.\n\nWith this new disk contribution we return to the starlight and other components fitting. This time we do not allow for any arbitrary power law in STARLIGHT code, as at the first stage, but we subtract the new disk emission from the data. We calculate a grid of data sets again for various normalizations of the Fe II and BC component, and runnning STARLIGHT code for each of them we again choose the solution with the lowest $\\chi^2$  as the best one.\n\nWe can repeat such iterations several times but we found that the second iteration is actually quite satisfactory, taking into account the fitting accuracy.  \n\n\\section{Results of the continuum fitting}\n\nFollowing the procedure described in Sect.~\\ref{sect:fitting} we present here the results of the fitting of all components: starlight, BC, Fe II and accretion disk to the broad band optical/UV/X-ray data.\nWe stress that here we adopt the value of redshift 0.0433 for this source, at the basis of the [OIII]5007 \\AA~ line. This value slightly differs from the value given by NED (z = 0.042443) and the value of z = 0.043 adopted by Bian \\& Huang (2010). The results for optical/UV fitting of all components are given in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}, and the results for disk component fitting are given in Table~\\ref{tab:optagn_fitting}.\n\n\\subsection{First stage opt/UV fitting}\n\nThe first stage fitting is interesting in itself since it allows for the direct comparison with the previous results obtained by Bian \\& Huang (2010).\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\caption{STARLIGHT fitting results for a disk contribution described as a power law with a fixed slope (upper part) or as comming from the opt/X-ray fitting (lower part).}   \n\\label{table:FirstStage}      \n\\centering                          \n\\begin{tabular}{l r r  r r r r r}        \n\\hline\\hline      \nslope    & Fe II  &  UVB     &   BC   & $f_{HST/SDSS}$ &  $A_V$   &   $v_d$  &  $\\chi^2/dof$ \\\\\n         & [$10^{-23}$] &    &  [$10^{-16}$] &         &          &   km s$^{-1}$ & \\\\ \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r  r r r r r}\n\\hline\n-0.5     &    3.0  &  -  &   -      &  -        & 0.004 & 0.05 &  1.25  \\\\       \n-7/3     &    4.5  &   - &   -      &  -        & 0.60    &  72  &  1.55 \\\\\n-7/3     &    3.0  &   - & 0.1      &  -        & 0.60    &  73  &  1.51 \\\\\n-7/3     &    2.5  &  -  & 2.0      & 1.28      & 0.38    & 124  &  1.40  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\nagn      &    2.5  &  -  & 2.0      & 1.28     & 0.53    & 124  &  1.36  \\\\\nagn      &    $2.5 \\pm 0.3$  &  $0.085 \\pm 0.015$  & $2.0 \\pm 0.2$  & $1.19 \\pm 0.06$     & 0.61    & 122  &  1.34  \\\\\n\\hline                                   \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\nWe first searched for the best solution to the optical/UV spectra without Balmer continuum contribution, and without any constraints for the slope of the underlying power law. The best fit solution was quite close to the solution found by Bian \\& Huang (2010). The implied slope was $\\alpha_{PL} = -0.5$ (in $F_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{\\alpha}$ convention) although we used the HST data as well, and we fitted the spectral range from 1500 \\AA ~ to 8900 \\AA.  The fit quality\nis actually better than in Bian \\& Huang (2010), with $\\chi^2/dof = 1.25$. The stellar systematic velocity is 133 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a spectral shift by 2.2 \\AA~\nto the red. If interpreted as a redshift inaccuracy, it would imply a shift by 0.0004. Determination of the redshift from O[III]$\\lambda 5007$ seems more accurate \n\nso this shift is likely real. The derived velocity dispersion is  consistent with zero, i.e. the broadening of the features intrinsic to the models is high enough to match the data and the intrinsic dispersion is not measurable. \nSince the average instrumental resolution of HST/FOS data for this object is 56 km/s, the SDSS resolution is 60 km/s (Greene \\& Ho 2005), and the resolution of the templates is 86 km s$^{-1}$ (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005). Using Eq.~3 of Bian \\& Huang (2010) we thus have an upper limit for the stellar velocity dispersion of 65 km s$^{-1}$.  In this case the stellar cluster does not require significant reddening ($A_V = 0.0004$). The stellar population results are similar to Bian \\& Huang (2010) results, strong contribution from the young stars of $\\sim 5 \\times 10^6$ yr is very important. The disk modeled by the power law contributes 63\\% of the light at 4020 \\AA.\n\n\nHowever, the best fit slope derived in the course of fitting is inconsistent with the disk contribution. Therefore, we also consider a case when the power law slope is frozen at \n$\\alpha = -7/3$, as in Shakura-Sunyaev disk. Such a fit is formally worse. The best  fit has $\\chi^2/dof = 1.55$. The stellar cluster systematic velocity is similar to the previous case (134 km s$^{-1}$) but the velocity dispersion required by the model is higher,  73 km s$^{-1}$ . Now the cluster requires significant reddening ($A_V = 0.60$). Since in these two cases the contribution of the power law at the location of the Ca II K is different, we plot the expansion of the two solutions in this region. We see that actually the solution with steep power law  $\\alpha = -7/3$ represents Ca K II absorption feature much better. This gives additional support in favor of the second solution, despite the global fit being worse in this case. The intrinsic stellar velocity obtained from the steep power law solution is much higher, 95 km s$^{-1}$. The power law contribution in this solution is much lower, only 23\\% at 4020 \\AA. \n\nBian \\& Huang (2010) analyzed the stellar content of the circumnuclear stellar cluster in much detail. Our first solution was very similar to theirs. The second solution is not much different. There are clearly two populations of stars: old, metal poor stars (Z = 0.004), ages of  5 - 10 Gyr, and young high metallicity stars (Z = 0.02 - 0.05), with ages in the range of  3 - 100 Myr. The dominating stars are somewhat older than in the previous case, with age $\\sim 10^7$ yr.  \n\n\\subsection{Disk fitting to opt/UV/X-ray data}\n\nHaving the contribution of the starlight, Fe II and Balmer continuum we can determine the disk contribution more accurately by subtracting these components from the original data.  \nWe combine the resulting opt/UV spectrum representing the disk emission with long XMM observation and perform\nthe disk fitting using the model {\\sc optxagnf} from XSPEC package (Arnaud 1996). The long XMM-Newton observation is taken from Middleton et al. (2011) (OBSID: 0506440101, with full exposure $\\sim$ 94 ks).\nThe disk model {\\sc optxagnf} is described in detailed in Sect. 3.4. Our base model to fit the broad band continuum reads {\\sc tbabs*optxagnf}, in which the Galactic value $N_{\\rm H}$ of {\\sc tbabs} is $1.47 \\times 10^{20}$ $\\rm cm^{-2}$. The input parameters of the model for the disk components are the black hole mass, $M_{\\odot}\\le M_{\\rm BH} \\le 10^9M_{\\odot}$, black hole spin, $0.0 \\le a \\le 0.998$, bolometric Eddington ratio, $-10 \\le \\rm log$ $L/L_{\\rm Edd} \\le 2$, coronal radius $1 \\le r_{\\rm cor} \\le 100$ in units of $r_g = G M/c^2$, the outer radius of the disk $3\\le \\rm log$ $r_{\\rm out}\\le 7$. The inclination angle in the {\\sc optxagnf} model is fixed with $60^{\\circ}$, although inclination angle could change the normalization by a factor $\\sim$ 2. Moreover, both the soft and hard Comptonization, i.e., electron temperature $T_{\\rm e}$, optical depth of the soft Comptonization component $\\tau$, spectral index of the hard Comptonization component $\\Gamma$,  are fixed with the values derived from X-ray spectrum fitting alone by Middleton et al. (2011), except that the input parameter, $0 \\le f_{\\rm pl} \\le 1$, is a free parameter in our fitting representing the fraction of the energy emitted in the hard Comptonization component.\n \nWe cannot fit all the parameter uniquely, so we consider in detail the three different estimates of the black hole mass coming from the QPO estimates, and we fit the broad band spectrum with respective given $M_{\\rm BH}$, seperately. The results are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:optagn_fitting} and plotted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:optagnfitting}. As for $M_{\\rm BH}=1.0\\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$, $6.9\\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, the broad band continuum can be fitted well with $\\chi^2/\\rm dof=131.76/132~(1.00), 127.89/132~(0.97)$. The black hole spins $a$ and the outer radius peg at their boundaries with $a=0.998$, and $\\rm log$ $r_{\\rm out}=3$, respectively. However, small black hole mass $M_{\\rm BH}=4.0 \\times 10^5 M_{\\odot}$ does not fit the data points at all, which is manifested that the optical model continuum is a factor 3 smaller than the optical observed continuum. Therefore, we need to clarify if this discrepancy could be due to the limit range of the {\\sc optxagnf} parameters (e.g. non-negative values of the spin) or the small value of black hole mass. The normalization of the optical luminosity $N \\propto (M_{\\rm BH}\\dot{M})^{2/3}=[M_{\\rm BH}\\cdot 10^{\\rm logL/L_{\\rm Edd}}\\cdot L_{\\rm Edd}/(\\eta c^2)]^{2/3}$ (Davis \\& Laor 2011), where $L_{\\rm Edd}=1.26 \\times 10^{38}M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}\\ \\rm erg/s$, the efficiency $\\eta$ can be derived as a function of the spin (Novikov \\& Thorne 1973; You et al 2015). In Table~\\ref{tab:optagn_fitting}, for $\\rm logM_{\\rm BH,1}/M_{\\odot}=7$, $\\rm logL_{1}/L_{\\rm Edd,1}=-0.77$ and $\\eta_{1}=0.32$ for $a=0.998$; for $\\rm logM_{\\rm BH,2}/M_{\\odot}=5.6$, $\\rm logL_{2}/L_{\\rm Edd,2}=0.51$. Therefore, the ratio of the normalization of the optical luminosity between the two black hole masses can be approximated with $[(M_{\\rm BH,1}/M_{\\rm BH,2})^2\\cdot 10^{\\rm logL_{1}/L_{\\rm Edd,1}-\\rm logL_{2}/L_{\\rm Edd,2}}\\cdot (\\eta_{2}/\\eta_{1})]^{2/3}=[32.8(\\eta_{2}/\\eta_{1})]^{2/3}$. If we assume  $a=-1.0$ for $\\rm logM_{\\rm BH,2}/M_{\\odot}=5.6$, $\\eta_{2}=0.038$, then the normalization ratio is about 2.5. So even a counter-rotating black hole with $a=-1.0$ in the model cannot fit the observed spectrum. This simple argument, based on the total energetics, shows that the small black hole mass is unable to bring a consistent fit for optical/UV and X-ray band, independently from any possible limitations of the adopted model. The minimum mass, acceptable for the model, for a counter-rotating disk is thus $1.2 \\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$. If we relax the assumption of the inclination angle of 60 deg, built into the model, and we replace it with the top view ($i = 0$ deg) the minimum (but also the maximum) black hole mass become lower by a factor of ${\\sqrt 2}$. Thus, the absolute minimum for the mass in this method is $8.5 \\times 10^5 M_{\\odot}$.\n  \n\n\\begin{table*}[ht!]\n\\caption{Best-fitting of {\\sc optagnf} to broad band continuum of RE J1034+396}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccccc}\n\\hline \\hline \\\\  [1pt]\n\n$\\rm log\\ M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}$ & \n$\\rm log$ $(L/L_{\\rm Edd})$ & \n$a$ &\n$r_{\\rm cor}$ &\n$\\rm log$ $r_{\\rm out}$ &\n$kT_{\\rm e}$ [keV] &\n$\\tau$ &\n$\\Gamma$ &\n$f_{\\rm pl}$ [\\%] &\n$\\chi^2$/dof ($\\chi^2_{\\nu}$) \\\\ [5pt]\n\\hline \\\\\n\n7.0 & \n$-0.77\\ ^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ &\n$0.998^{\\ast}$ &\n$9.90\\ ^{+2.35}_{-1.88}$ &\n$3.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$0.195^{\\star}$ &\n$14.1^{\\star}$ &\n$2.33^{\\star}$ &\n$11.53\\ ^{+1.21}_{-1.04}$ &\n131.76/132 (1.00) \\\\ [5pt]\n\\hline \\\\% ----------------------------------------------------\n\n6.8 & \n$-0.47\\ ^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ &\n$0.998^{\\ast}$ &\n$25.96\\ ^{+2.92}_{-2.87}$ &\n$3.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$0.195^{\\star}$ &\n$14.1^{\\star}$ &\n$2.33^{\\star}$ &\n$8.15\\ ^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ &\n127.89/132 (0.97) \\\\ [5pt]\n\\hline \\\\% ---------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n5.6 & \n$0.51$ &\n$0.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$100.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$7.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$0.195^{\\star}$ &\n$14.1^{\\star}$ &\n$2.33^{\\star}$ &\n$14.37$ &\n407.52/133 (3.06) \\\\ [5pt]\n\n\\hline\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\tablefoot{The best fitting spectral parameters.

The corresponding results of model fitting are plotted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:optagnfit2}. The solution for the mass $M = 1.0 \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ gives very similar results for the starlight properties.\n\n\nThe shape of the disk component resulting from broad band fits, refered to as ``agn'', is clearly different from a power law. We thus made an excercise by retaining all other parameters (Fe II shape and normalization, BC normalization and the correction factor for grey-shifting the HST data) and simply replaced the power law with a new {\\sl agn} shape and normalization. The new fit from the STARLIGHT code shows an immediate improvement of the $\\chi^2$ (see Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}). We then allowed all the normalizations to vary, we also included the UV Fe II template from Vestergaard \\& Wilkes (2001) below 2500 \\AA. The results are given in the last line of Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}. The final  $\\chi^2$ is better although it does not reach the best fit value obtained with a red power law (first line in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}). \n\nThe final solution in $F_{\\lambda}$ space is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt}. The fit seem satisfactory in the optical band. In the UV part the Fe II template is probably not well accounting for the spectral features. \n\nThe same result, but in $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ space is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:optnuFnu}. Here we also conveniently plot the observationally determined disk contribution (i.e. the difference between the data and the starlight plus BC plus Fe II contribution, with masked data part removed, shown as a green line) and the binned data points representing the disk, with errors determined as described in Sect.~\\ref{sect:fitting}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\centering\n\n \n    \\includegraphics[width=0.95 \\hsize]{widma_cale_v4.eps}\n    \\caption{The best fit to the optical/UV spectrum of RE J1034+396 (red line)to the data (black line);  dashed magenta line shows the disk contribution, green line - Balmer Continuum and blue line the Fe II contribution.

This is less than in Bian \\& Huang (2010) where the disk (a power law) exceeded 50 \\% at 4020\\AA. Their analysis did not extend beyond 3400\\AA. \n\n\nThe properties of the stellar populations from our final fit are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:populations}. New fit still gives qualitatively similar results to the original paper of Bian \\& Huang (2010). Two populations of stars are thus indeed characteristic for the nucleus of RE J1034+396. Most of the light actually comes from the young stellar population, with ages 10 - 100 million years, and solar metallicity of 0.02. The stars are thus older than implied by power law fits. The stars are hidden in the highly obscuring medium, as implied by $A_V = 0.61$. The stellar dispersion obtained directly from the code is 122 km s$^{-1}$, which reduced to true stellar velocity dispersion of 136 km s$^{-1}$ when corrected for the spectral resolution of the data and instrumental effects (see Eq. 3 of Bian \\& Huang 2010). This value implies rather high black hole mass $5.8 \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ if we use the formula of Kormendy \\& Ho (2013). It is much higher than the value obtained by Bian \\& Huang (2010), $ (1 - 4) \\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, since our measured velocity dispersion in the final model is higher. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\hsize]{content_B0021.eps}\n    \\caption{The properties of the stellar populations after the final opt/UV/X-ray fitting.}\n    \\label{fig:populations}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral features in absorption}\n\nThe decomposition of the optical/UV spectrum into the disk and starlight depends on the description of the disk model. Formal solution with a blue power law is better in $\\chi^2$ term (see the first and the last lines in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}. Therefore, we take a closer look at individual spectral features in order to see which of the two models provide better representation of the data. \n\nUnfortunately, the starlight contamination in an AGN is not easy to determine just from the individual absorption features since some of the usual starlight signatures in the form of absorption lines are filled up with broader emission lines from the BLR. We first checked directly in the data whether any absorption features are actually seen in our object. We used the features recommended by Cid Fernandes et al. (1998). \n\nWe searched for these features in the available spectra. The enlarged spectra in the promising wavelength range are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:absorption}. We did not include the Ca II K + H$\\epsilon$ band $\\lambda\\lambda$3952-3988 since it is strongly contaminated by emission, and the Na I region  $\\lambda\\lambda$5880-5914 as there is no visible spectral feature. We see some traces of absorption in four bands. The Ca II K is the most clear case, additionally located in the bluer part of the spectrum. Here we see that the complex but physically justified model of the accretion disk contribution reproduces well the depth of the feature while the blue power law solution (the first line in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}) gives too shallow absorption feature meaning that the disk contribution is overestimated in this model. Other three features are not so deep, and both fits are comparable although formally they differ by a factor of 2 in the derived stellar dispersion value. This is because the data as well as input models are marginal for the purpose of the stellar dispersion measurement.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=1.4\\hsize]{widma_lambda_features.eps}\n    \\caption{The Ca II K, CN, Gband and Mg I absorption features: the observed spectrum (black line), and best fit power law solution (green line) and the agn disk solution (red line).}\n    \\label{fig:absorption}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\hsize]{widma_lambda_Hbeta.eps}\n    \\caption{The H$\\beta$ line, with starlight and all other contributions subtracted; the observed line (magenta) is quite well fitted with a single Lorentzian (green dashed line) of FWHM = 5 \\AA.}\n    \\label{fig:Hbeta}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Black hole mass from H$\\beta$}\n\nNew decomposition of the optical spectrum allow us to revisit the determination of the black hole mass from H$\\beta$ line.

The studies of individual objects highly benefit from a black hole mass determination since it is widely accepted that the ratio of the luminosity to the Eddington luminosity is a key parameter determining the properties of the type 1 unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). Eddington ratio is considered to be the leading parameter in the Eigenvector 1 determined at the basis of the Principal Component Analysis of the optical spectra and broad band spectral shape (Boroson \\& Green 1992;  Sulentic et al. 2000, Marziani et al. 2001; Kuraszkiewicz et al. 2009; Shen \\& Ho 2014). Tests of this\nhypothesis relay on black hole mass determination. In cosmology, the determination of the black hole mass range as a function of redshift puts strong constraints on the galaxy evolution (e.g. Peng et al. 2006;  Shankar 2009;  Dubois, Volonteri \\& Silk 2014,  Aversa et al. 2015). \n\nSeveral methods of black hole mass measurements have been developed (for a reviews, see e.g. Czerny \\& Nikolajuk 2010), but all of them have certain systematic errors which are difficult to estimate. The best established method is based on reverberation studies in the optical band. The measurement of the time delay between the variable continuum emitted by central parts of an accretion disk surrounding a black hole and the response of the  Broad Emission Lines originating in the Broad Line Region (BLR) allows to measure the distance, and the line spectral shape gives the estimate of the orbital velocities of the BLR clouds (e.g. Peterson 1993). This method was applied directly to over 50 objects so far (Wandel et al. 1999; Kaspi et al. 2000;  Peterson et al. 2004; Bentz al. 2009; Bentz et al. 2010; Denney \\& Peterson 2010; Grier et al. 2012; Rafter et al.  2013; Peterson et al. 2014; Du et al. 2014; Du et al. 2015; Hu et al. 2015), and some campaigns are under way (King et al. 2015; De Rosa et al. 2015, Shen et al. 2015, Modzelewska et al. 2014, Hryniewicz et al. 2014, Valenti et al. 2015). Observationally discovered scaling between the BLR size and monochromatic luminosity (see Bentz et al. 2009 for the most recent parameters)  allowed to extend the method to thousands of  AGN (e.g. Vestergaard \\& Peterson 2006, Kollmeier et al. 2006; Woo et al. 2008; Shen et al. 2011).\n\nHowever, the reverberation method does not always apply since the condition is that we must measure well one of the important BLR lines (H$\\beta$, Mg II or CIV) and the variable monochromatic continuum. In some cases this is not possible, most frequently because of too high obscuration of the nucleus.  However, there may be other reasons, and  RE J1034+396 is one such example. On the other hand, the value of the black hole mass in this source is extremely important because this is the first, and the best, example of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) discovered in an AGN in the X-ray band (Gierlinski et al. 2008; Alston et al. 2014).\n\nRE J1034+396 ($z = 0.042443$, after NED\\footnote{NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database}) is an exceptional active galaxy in many aspects. The source has been already contained in the catalog of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies prepared by Zwicky \\& Herzog (1966). Initially described as a compact galaxy (Zwicky \\& Herzog 1966), it is currently classified as a Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy. It is EUV-bright, and the Big Blue Bump of this Seyfert galaxy has exceptionally high temperature so the high energy turnover is observed in the soft X-rays (Puchnarewicz et al. 1995). This unique  Big Blue Bump has been subsequently studied in a number of papers (Puchnarewicz et al. 1998, Mason et al. 1996, Wang \\& Netzer 2003, Crummy et al. 2006, Casebeer et al. 2006, Done et al. 2012). It is also the first source which unquestionably shows the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in the X-ray emission with the period of $2.7 \\times 10^{-4}$ Hz \n(Gierlinski et al. 2008, Middleton, Uttley \\& Done\n2011; Alston et al. 2014). The warm absorber in this source is not strong, and varies with the QPO phase (Maitra \\& Miller 2010).\n\nRE~J1034+396 shows well developed BLR lines (Puchnarewicz et al. 1995) but the nature of the optical continuum is unclear, and this continuum does not vary (Puchnarewicz et al. 1998). The possibility that the optical/UV continuum comes from a strongly irradiated accretion disk was discussed by Soria \\& Puchnarewicz (2002) and  Loska et al. (2004). On the other hand, Bian \\& Huang (2010) argued that most of the emission is simply due to the starlight. In modelling they allowed for the presence of an additional power law but the derived slope ($F_{\\lambda} \\approx \\lambda^{-0.5}$) was not consistent with the tail of an accretion disk. Therefore the source is not a good candidate for reverberation monitoring, and the mean-spectrum approach  is also difficult as it requires precise determination of the accretion disk contribution to the continuum. The soft X-ray emission dominated by the comptonized disk emission is also mostly constant, and the observed QPO is connected with the variable hard X-ray power law tail (Middleton et al. 2009).  \n\n The black hole mass in this galaxy has been estimated by a number of authors using different methods but the results span a broad range of values (e.g. $(2 - 10) \\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, Puchnarewicz et al. 2001, $(0.6 - 3)\\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, Soria \\& Puchnarewicz 2002, and $6.3 \\times 10^5 M_{\\odot}$, Loska et al. 2004) from broad-band continuum models; $(1 - 4) \\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$ from stellar velocity dispersion and H$\\beta$ line profile, Bian \\& Huang 2010; $6.3 \\times 10^5, 3.6 \\times 10^7$, and $1.3 \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ from H$\\beta$ line width, O[III] line width, and soft X-ray luminosity, correspondingly (Bian \\& Zhao 2004). The observed QPO period of $2.7\\times 10^{-4}$ Hz (Gierlinski et al. 2008), if identified with the low frequency QPO dives the black hole mass below \n$4 \\times 10^5 M_{\\odot}$, corresponding to the Eddington ratio above 10 for the observed bolometric luminosity of \n$5 \\times 10^{44}$ ers s$^{-1}$. Identification of the QPO with high frequency oscillations lead to values of $6.9 \\times 10^6$ or $1.0\\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$, depending on the choice of the higher or lower value of the resonance frequency. \n\nIn this paper we use the available optical/UV and X-ray data and attempt to determine the black hole mass in this object using several complementary methods.\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{sect:data}\n\nWe collected the archival data from several instruments with the aim to model the broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) covering IR-optical-X-ray band and to apply three independent methods of the black hole mass determination.\n\nIn the optical/UV  band we use both the SDSS data and the HST. The SDSS spectrum was taken 29 December 2003 and HST/FOS data were collected 31 January 1997. We combined the two data sets, but we allow for a grey shift between the two data sets if some weak variability is actually present in the source, in far UV band. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data sets were dereddened for the Galactic extinction with the use of Cardelli et al. extinction law (Cardelli, Clayton \\& Mathis 1989). The reddening in this direction is very small ( $E_{B-V} = 0.014$, Schlafly \\& Finkbeiner 2011) so the reddening correction was not very significant. Since the redshift given in NED was based on the old data set (Karachentsev, Lebedev, \\& Shcherbanovskij 1985) we used the O[III]$\\lambda5007$ line for better redshift determination. In the further analysis we thus adopt $z =  0.0433 $ for this object. It is only slightly different from the value of 0.043 adopted by Bian \\& Huang (2010). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn X-rays several measurements  were available from XMM-Newton satellite. The source is clearly variable, and we use these measurements to calculate the excess variance and the mean SED in this energy range. We use the 28 lightcurves from the XMM satellite in the 2-10 keV band which were collected in the period from May 2002 to May 2011.  Those lightcurves are mostly short but they are used to calculate the X-ray variance. Finally, we use the long XMM lightcurve (94 ksec) obtained by Middleton et al. (2011) for the broad band spectrum fitting.\n\n\\section{Models of the broad band continuum}\n\nThe broad band spectrum of a Narrow Line Seyfert galaxy is expected to consist of the accretion disk contribution to the continuum, host galaxy emission (particularly the circumnnuclear stellar cluster), and possibly some dust emission in the red and Near-IR. The disk emission is additionally comptonized in the accretion disk corona responsible for the power law tail of the spectrum in the X-ray band (Done, Gierli\\' nski \\& Kubota 2007; Cao 2009; You, Cao \\& Yuan 2012). These broad components are supplemented by important localized spectral features connected with AGN activity: BLR lines, Fe II pseudo-continuum and Balmer continuum. We do not model the BLR lines, and instead we mask the strong emission line regions in the spectrum. However, we model all the remaining spectral components as they are essential for the correct decomposition of the spectrum.\n\n\\subsection{Starlight contribution}\n\nAs it was shown by Bian \\& Huang (2010), the optical spectrum of RE J1034 is mostly dominated by the starlight. However, the traces of the accretion disk contribution are also visible and in Bian \\& Huang (2010) they were modeled by a power law of arbitrary slope. The best fit slope ($F_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{-0.58}$, $F_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{-1.42}$), however, is clearly inconsistent with the expectations of the accretion disk theory (Shakura \\& Sunyaev 1973) ($F_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{-7/3}$).  Therefore we repeat the starlight analysis of Bian \\& Huang (2010), using the same \nSTARLIGHT\\footnote{http://astro.ufsc.br/starlight/node/1} publicly available code (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005, 2009). We use the same 45 templates of Bruzual \\& Charlot (2003).\n\n\\subsection{Fe II pseudo-continuum}\n\nThe contribution of the Fe II emission is seen both in the optical and in the UV range. Modeling quasars (Hryniewicz et al. 2014, Modzelewska et al. 2014) we found that the theoretical models of the Fe II emission smeared due to the velocity dispersion of order of $\\sim 900$ km s$^{-1}$ are actually better than observational templates, particularly in the region of Mg II$\\lambda2800$. Each of their templates is calculated for different value of the density, turbulent velocity, and ionization parameter. As a reference, we use the best-fit template for CTS C30.10 (Modzelewska et al. 2014) corresponding to a local density ($n = 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, turbulent velocity of 20 km s$^{-1}$ and ionization parameter $\u00ce\u00a6 = 10^{20.5}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-2}$). However, these templates do not cover the shortest wavelengths below 2000 \\AA. In this region observational templates are better since they also contain other Fe contributions. We thus use the models of Bruhweiler and Verner (2008) above 2250 \\AA ~and the Vestergaard \\& Wilkes (2001) below 2250 \\AA, in the \\verb+Fe_UVtemplt_B+ version. The theoretical templates were broadened with a Gaussian profile, assuming 900 km s$^{-1}$. \n\n\\subsection{Balmer continuum}\n\nTo model the Balmer continuum (BC) we repeat the procedure described in Dietrich et al. (2002) and the references therein. Blueward of the Balmer\nedge ($\\lambda \\approx 3675$\\,\\AA), this feature is described by the Planck function $B_{\\nu}(T_{e})$ (Grandi 1982) with constant electron\ntemperature of 15\\,000 K. The optical depth is not assumed constant but its change with wavelength is computed using a simple formula:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\tau_{\\nu} = \\tau_{BE} (\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{BE}})^{-3},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\tau_{\\nu}=\\tau_{BE}(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{BE}})^{-3},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>\u03bd</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mfrac><mi>\u03bd</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow></msub></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02498.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $M_{BH}$ is in units of $M_{\\odot}$, $\\lambda L_\\lambda$ is in units of $10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, FWHM in 1000 km s$^{-1}$. The coefficients A and B are 6.91 and 0.5 for H$\\beta$ (Vestergaard \\& Osmer 2009), with continuum measured at 5100 \\AA, and for Mg II they are 6.86 and 0.47, correspondingly (Vestergaard \\& Peterson 2006), and the continuum is measured at 3000 \\AA. Those values were successfully used in a recent paper by Sun et al. (2015) for a sample of objects. \n\nThe bolometric luminosity of RE J1034+369 is 44.43 or 44.33, depending on the solution, and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100 \\AA ~ is 42.70. We note that the bolometric correction for this source is exceptionally large, much larger than the factor 9 - 10 usually adopted. With this value of a monochromatic flux, the formula above  gives $\\log M_{BH} = 5.9$ from H$\\beta$, and $\\log M_{BH} = 6.15$ from Mg II.  \n\nWe also try the formula of Collin et al. (2006), their Eq.~7. This formula implies the $f$ factor of 1.83 for H$\\beta$, and the corresponding value of the black hole mass $\\log M_{BH} = 6.08$. All these values are consistent with each other. \n\nO[III] line is highly assymetric. When all other spectral components are subtracted, the red part of the line is consistent with a single Gaussian shape, but the blue part shows strong shoulder. If we use the red part of the line, we obtain the velocity dispersion of 138 km s$^{-1}$. If we correct this value for the instrumental broadening of SDSS data (60 km s$^{-1}$) we obtain 124 km s$^{-1}$. Bian \\& Huang (2010) made a proper decomposition of the line and obtained the stellar dispersion from the narrow component of 124 km s$^{-1}$. If this value is treated as an indicator of the stellar dispersion, the black hole mass implied is $2 \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$. \n\n\\section{Black hole mass from the X-ray variability}\n\n\\subsection{Method}\n\nThe black hole mass can be conveniently determined from the high frequency tail of the X-ray power density spectrum (e.g. Hayashida et al. 1998, Czerny et al. 2001). \nThis tail is not affected by the Eddington ratio (see Gierlinski et al. 2008 study of galactic sources in various luminosity states), unlike the position of the break (McHardy et al. 2006). Instead of computing the power spectrum, it is more convenient to use the excess variance directly calculated from the data (Nikolajuk et al. 2004).\nWe used the 28 lightcurves from the XMM satellite in the 2-10 keV band (see Sect.~\\ref{sect:data}). The duration of the individual \nexposures varied from 1300 s to 1.07 day, with the median value of about 40 ks. We determined the dimensionless X-ray variance, $\\sigma_{exc}$, normalized by the average flux, for each of the curves separately, and we\ncalculated the individual values of the black hole mass from each lightcurve using the formula\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 40896, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\tau_{BE}$ is the optical depth at the Balmer edge radiation frequency ($\\nu_{BE}$).\nRedward of the Balmer edge blend of hydrogen emission lines is generated. This was done using atomic data provided by Storey \\& Hummer\n(1995) with the recombination line intensities for case B (opaque nebula), $T_{e}$ = 15\\,000 K, $n_{e} = 10^{8}-10^{10}\\, {\\rm cm}^{-3}$.\nThe accounted Balmer emission lines covered excitation top level for the transitions in the range $10 \\leq n \\leq 50$.\n\n\\subsection{Accretion disk model of the broad band spectrum}\n\nFor the description of the accretion disk emission we use the model {\\sc optxagnf} developed by Done\net al. (2012) for the purpose of modeling NLS1, and implemented in XSPEC (Arnaud 1996). This phenomenological model well represents the complexity of the disk emission. Bare disk in this model is seen for radii larger than $R_{cor}$, and the inner disk region is covered by the disk corona. The local disk emission is color-corrected using the approximations given in Done et al. (2012). Inside $R_{cor}$, part of the energy is dissipated in the corona. Two thermal Comptonization media are necessary. Low temperature Comptonization is necessary to model the soft X-ray excess. This soft Comptonization is described by the electron temperature, $T_e$, and the optical depth, $\\tau$, and implemented in XSPEC as {\\sc comptt} (Titarchuk 1994). The second Comptonization has to reproduce the power law emission which dominates above 2 keV. This high temperature component is described by {\\sc nthcomp} (Zdziarski et al. 1996), and parameterized by the hard X-ray slope, $\\Gamma$, and the fraction of energy, $f_{pl}$, dissipated in the hard X-ray emitting corona, while the temperature of the hot coronal phase is fixed at 100 keV. The soft part of the corona may physically correspond to an optically thick skin on the top of the disk, and it is likely strongly magnetized (R\\' o\\. za\\' nska et al. 2015).\n\nInput parameters of the model are the black hole mass, $M_{BH}$, black hole spin, $a$, bolometric Eddington ratio, $L/L_{\\rm Edd}$, $R_{cor}$,  $T_e$, $\\tau$, $\\Gamma$, $f_{pl}$,  the comoving (proper) distance of the source, and redshift. \n\n\\section{Fitting methods}\n\\label{sect:fitting}\n\nThe model contains numerous free parameters,  and 45 of those are normalizations of different starlight components in the STARLIGHT code. Since we use this special code for starlight fitting, based on very efficient Monte Carlo Markoff Chain method, while X-ray data fitting with XSPEC has also its complexity, we divided the fitting procedure in two parts which are done independently, and the global solution is obtained through iterations between the two parts.\n\nWe first model the optical/UV part. This approach has also the advantage of giving results directly comparable to Bian \\& Huang (2010). \n\nIn that part we (temporarily) replace the disk component with the power law, as in Bian \\& Huang (2010). We subtract Fe II emission and Balmer continuum from the data, using a dense grid of the normalizations of these components, and then we run the  STARLIGHT code with a pre-set power law slope to get the starlight shape given by 45 normalizations of the components, the systematic stellar velocity, stellar velocity dispersion and the reddening. The resulting $\\chi^2$  is used to select the best fit solution. Regions of the strong BLR emissions are masked and do not contribute to the fit quality.  The gap between the SDSS and HST data is masked as well, and the shift in the HST data is allowed.\n\nHaving the initial decomposition of the optical/UV spectrum, we subtract the starlight, Fe II and Balmer continuum from the original data. We are then left with the disk component. In principle, we could just use the power law from the best fit model as the disk representation in the optical/UV part but the power law is not a perfect representation of the disk shape due to the radius-dependent color correction. \n\nThe number of data points is much higher in optical/UV band (5401) than in the X-ray band (109), despite masking the strong emission line regions. Without binning, this would lead to a strong dependence of disk fitting on the optical/UV part where the disk contribution is actually very minor in most part of the spectrum. We thus bin the optical/UV points representing the disk contribution, with the gaps retained, as in the optical/UV data fitting. Gaps are then ignored in the broad band fitting (including X-rays).  \n\nFor the errors in the resulting data points we take the statistical errors derived from the initial errors in the spectrum, but we also include the systematic errors. Binning reduces the statistical errors down to very small values. On the other hand, the disk component is formed by subtraction of the very complex model from the original data. Although the fit is generally reasonable, it is not perfect, and some systematic patterns are clearly visible in the residuals. They bias the small expected disk contribution significantly. We thus used additional systematic error ingredient in the disk component fitting procedure. In order to account for generally higher data quality in the optical band and lower in the UV part, we assumed that this systematic error in the original data set is of the type $A(1000/\\lambda)$. The normalization A was determined by assumption that the best fit of the full model described above should give the reduced $\\chi^2$ equal 1 (without it, it is about 1.3). In this way we obtained the value $A = 2.0 \\times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-1}$. When subsequently we bin the data, the statistical error is reduced, but we retain this systematic error for the disk component.\n\nWe then combine the resulting opt/UV spectrum representing the disk emission with long XMM observation and perform the disk fitting using the model {\\sc optxagnf} from XSPEC package. The best fit accretion disk model is again selected by minimizing the $\\chi^2$. From this broad band fit we obtain new approximation for the disk contribution to the optical/UV band which is not of a power law shape, mostly due to the color-correction to the disk emission.\n\nWith this new disk contribution we return to the starlight and other components fitting. This time we do not allow for any arbitrary power law in STARLIGHT code, as at the first stage, but we subtract the new disk emission from the data. We calculate a grid of data sets again for various normalizations of the Fe II and BC component, and runnning STARLIGHT code for each of them we again choose the solution with the lowest $\\chi^2$  as the best one.\n\nWe can repeat such iterations several times but we found that the second iteration is actually quite satisfactory, taking into account the fitting accuracy.  \n\n\\section{Results of the continuum fitting}\n\nFollowing the procedure described in Sect.~\\ref{sect:fitting} we present here the results of the fitting of all components: starlight, BC, Fe II and accretion disk to the broad band optical/UV/X-ray data.\nWe stress that here we adopt the value of redshift 0.0433 for this source, at the basis of the [OIII]5007 \\AA~ line. This value slightly differs from the value given by NED (z = 0.042443) and the value of z = 0.043 adopted by Bian \\& Huang (2010). The results for optical/UV fitting of all components are given in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}, and the results for disk component fitting are given in Table~\\ref{tab:optagn_fitting}.\n\n\\subsection{First stage opt/UV fitting}\n\nThe first stage fitting is interesting in itself since it allows for the direct comparison with the previous results obtained by Bian \\& Huang (2010).\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\caption{STARLIGHT fitting results for a disk contribution described as a power law with a fixed slope (upper part) or as comming from the opt/X-ray fitting (lower part).}   \n\\label{table:FirstStage}      \n\\centering                          \n\\begin{tabular}{l r r  r r r r r}        \n\\hline\\hline      \nslope    & Fe II  &  UVB     &   BC   & $f_{HST/SDSS}$ &  $A_V$   &   $v_d$  &  $\\chi^2/dof$ \\\\\n         & [$10^{-23}$] &    &  [$10^{-16}$] &         &          &   km s$^{-1}$ & \\\\ \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r  r r r r r}\n\\hline\n-0.5     &    3.0  &  -  &   -      &  -        & 0.004 & 0.05 &  1.25  \\\\       \n-7/3     &    4.5  &   - &   -      &  -        & 0.60    &  72  &  1.55 \\\\\n-7/3     &    3.0  &   - & 0.1      &  -        & 0.60    &  73  &  1.51 \\\\\n-7/3     &    2.5  &  -  & 2.0      & 1.28      & 0.38    & 124  &  1.40  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\nagn      &    2.5  &  -  & 2.0      & 1.28     & 0.53    & 124  &  1.36  \\\\\nagn      &    $2.5 \\pm 0.3$  &  $0.085 \\pm 0.015$  & $2.0 \\pm 0.2$  & $1.19 \\pm 0.06$     & 0.61    & 122  &  1.34  \\\\\n\\hline                                   \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\nWe first searched for the best solution to the optical/UV spectra without Balmer continuum contribution, and without any constraints for the slope of the underlying power law. The best fit solution was quite close to the solution found by Bian \\& Huang (2010). The implied slope was $\\alpha_{PL} = -0.5$ (in $F_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{\\alpha}$ convention) although we used the HST data as well, and we fitted the spectral range from 1500 \\AA ~ to 8900 \\AA.  The fit quality\nis actually better than in Bian \\& Huang (2010), with $\\chi^2/dof = 1.25$. The stellar systematic velocity is 133 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a spectral shift by 2.2 \\AA~\nto the red. If interpreted as a redshift inaccuracy, it would imply a shift by 0.0004. Determination of the redshift from O[III]$\\lambda 5007$ seems more accurate \n\nso this shift is likely real. The derived velocity dispersion is  consistent with zero, i.e. the broadening of the features intrinsic to the models is high enough to match the data and the intrinsic dispersion is not measurable. \nSince the average instrumental resolution of HST/FOS data for this object is 56 km/s, the SDSS resolution is 60 km/s (Greene \\& Ho 2005), and the resolution of the templates is 86 km s$^{-1}$ (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005). Using Eq.~3 of Bian \\& Huang (2010) we thus have an upper limit for the stellar velocity dispersion of 65 km s$^{-1}$.  In this case the stellar cluster does not require significant reddening ($A_V = 0.0004$). The stellar population results are similar to Bian \\& Huang (2010) results, strong contribution from the young stars of $\\sim 5 \\times 10^6$ yr is very important. The disk modeled by the power law contributes 63\\% of the light at 4020 \\AA.\n\n\nHowever, the best fit slope derived in the course of fitting is inconsistent with the disk contribution. Therefore, we also consider a case when the power law slope is frozen at \n$\\alpha = -7/3$, as in Shakura-Sunyaev disk. Such a fit is formally worse. The best  fit has $\\chi^2/dof = 1.55$. The stellar cluster systematic velocity is similar to the previous case (134 km s$^{-1}$) but the velocity dispersion required by the model is higher,  73 km s$^{-1}$ . Now the cluster requires significant reddening ($A_V = 0.60$). Since in these two cases the contribution of the power law at the location of the Ca II K is different, we plot the expansion of the two solutions in this region. We see that actually the solution with steep power law  $\\alpha = -7/3$ represents Ca K II absorption feature much better. This gives additional support in favor of the second solution, despite the global fit being worse in this case. The intrinsic stellar velocity obtained from the steep power law solution is much higher, 95 km s$^{-1}$. The power law contribution in this solution is much lower, only 23\\% at 4020 \\AA. \n\nBian \\& Huang (2010) analyzed the stellar content of the circumnuclear stellar cluster in much detail. Our first solution was very similar to theirs. The second solution is not much different. There are clearly two populations of stars: old, metal poor stars (Z = 0.004), ages of  5 - 10 Gyr, and young high metallicity stars (Z = 0.02 - 0.05), with ages in the range of  3 - 100 Myr. The dominating stars are somewhat older than in the previous case, with age $\\sim 10^7$ yr.  \n\n\\subsection{Disk fitting to opt/UV/X-ray data}\n\nHaving the contribution of the starlight, Fe II and Balmer continuum we can determine the disk contribution more accurately by subtracting these components from the original data.  \nWe combine the resulting opt/UV spectrum representing the disk emission with long XMM observation and perform\nthe disk fitting using the model {\\sc optxagnf} from XSPEC package (Arnaud 1996). The long XMM-Newton observation is taken from Middleton et al. (2011) (OBSID: 0506440101, with full exposure $\\sim$ 94 ks).\nThe disk model {\\sc optxagnf} is described in detailed in Sect. 3.4. Our base model to fit the broad band continuum reads {\\sc tbabs*optxagnf}, in which the Galactic value $N_{\\rm H}$ of {\\sc tbabs} is $1.47 \\times 10^{20}$ $\\rm cm^{-2}$. The input parameters of the model for the disk components are the black hole mass, $M_{\\odot}\\le M_{\\rm BH} \\le 10^9M_{\\odot}$, black hole spin, $0.0 \\le a \\le 0.998$, bolometric Eddington ratio, $-10 \\le \\rm log$ $L/L_{\\rm Edd} \\le 2$, coronal radius $1 \\le r_{\\rm cor} \\le 100$ in units of $r_g = G M/c^2$, the outer radius of the disk $3\\le \\rm log$ $r_{\\rm out}\\le 7$. The inclination angle in the {\\sc optxagnf} model is fixed with $60^{\\circ}$, although inclination angle could change the normalization by a factor $\\sim$ 2. Moreover, both the soft and hard Comptonization, i.e., electron temperature $T_{\\rm e}$, optical depth of the soft Comptonization component $\\tau$, spectral index of the hard Comptonization component $\\Gamma$,  are fixed with the values derived from X-ray spectrum fitting alone by Middleton et al. (2011), except that the input parameter, $0 \\le f_{\\rm pl} \\le 1$, is a free parameter in our fitting representing the fraction of the energy emitted in the hard Comptonization component.\n \nWe cannot fit all the parameter uniquely, so we consider in detail the three different estimates of the black hole mass coming from the QPO estimates, and we fit the broad band spectrum with respective given $M_{\\rm BH}$, seperately. The results are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:optagn_fitting} and plotted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:optagnfitting}. As for $M_{\\rm BH}=1.0\\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$, $6.9\\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, the broad band continuum can be fitted well with $\\chi^2/\\rm dof=131.76/132~(1.00), 127.89/132~(0.97)$. The black hole spins $a$ and the outer radius peg at their boundaries with $a=0.998$, and $\\rm log$ $r_{\\rm out}=3$, respectively. However, small black hole mass $M_{\\rm BH}=4.0 \\times 10^5 M_{\\odot}$ does not fit the data points at all, which is manifested that the optical model continuum is a factor 3 smaller than the optical observed continuum. Therefore, we need to clarify if this discrepancy could be due to the limit range of the {\\sc optxagnf} parameters (e.g. non-negative values of the spin) or the small value of black hole mass. The normalization of the optical luminosity $N \\propto (M_{\\rm BH}\\dot{M})^{2/3}=[M_{\\rm BH}\\cdot 10^{\\rm logL/L_{\\rm Edd}}\\cdot L_{\\rm Edd}/(\\eta c^2)]^{2/3}$ (Davis \\& Laor 2011), where $L_{\\rm Edd}=1.26 \\times 10^{38}M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}\\ \\rm erg/s$, the efficiency $\\eta$ can be derived as a function of the spin (Novikov \\& Thorne 1973; You et al 2015). In Table~\\ref{tab:optagn_fitting}, for $\\rm logM_{\\rm BH,1}/M_{\\odot}=7$, $\\rm logL_{1}/L_{\\rm Edd,1}=-0.77$ and $\\eta_{1}=0.32$ for $a=0.998$; for $\\rm logM_{\\rm BH,2}/M_{\\odot}=5.6$, $\\rm logL_{2}/L_{\\rm Edd,2}=0.51$. Therefore, the ratio of the normalization of the optical luminosity between the two black hole masses can be approximated with $[(M_{\\rm BH,1}/M_{\\rm BH,2})^2\\cdot 10^{\\rm logL_{1}/L_{\\rm Edd,1}-\\rm logL_{2}/L_{\\rm Edd,2}}\\cdot (\\eta_{2}/\\eta_{1})]^{2/3}=[32.8(\\eta_{2}/\\eta_{1})]^{2/3}$. If we assume  $a=-1.0$ for $\\rm logM_{\\rm BH,2}/M_{\\odot}=5.6$, $\\eta_{2}=0.038$, then the normalization ratio is about 2.5. So even a counter-rotating black hole with $a=-1.0$ in the model cannot fit the observed spectrum. This simple argument, based on the total energetics, shows that the small black hole mass is unable to bring a consistent fit for optical/UV and X-ray band, independently from any possible limitations of the adopted model. The minimum mass, acceptable for the model, for a counter-rotating disk is thus $1.2 \\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$. If we relax the assumption of the inclination angle of 60 deg, built into the model, and we replace it with the top view ($i = 0$ deg) the minimum (but also the maximum) black hole mass become lower by a factor of ${\\sqrt 2}$. Thus, the absolute minimum for the mass in this method is $8.5 \\times 10^5 M_{\\odot}$.\n  \n\n\\begin{table*}[ht!]\n\\caption{Best-fitting of {\\sc optagnf} to broad band continuum of RE J1034+396}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccccc}\n\\hline \\hline \\\\  [1pt]\n\n$\\rm log\\ M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}$ & \n$\\rm log$ $(L/L_{\\rm Edd})$ & \n$a$ &\n$r_{\\rm cor}$ &\n$\\rm log$ $r_{\\rm out}$ &\n$kT_{\\rm e}$ [keV] &\n$\\tau$ &\n$\\Gamma$ &\n$f_{\\rm pl}$ [\\%] &\n$\\chi^2$/dof ($\\chi^2_{\\nu}$) \\\\ [5pt]\n\\hline \\\\\n\n7.0 & \n$-0.77\\ ^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ &\n$0.998^{\\ast}$ &\n$9.90\\ ^{+2.35}_{-1.88}$ &\n$3.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$0.195^{\\star}$ &\n$14.1^{\\star}$ &\n$2.33^{\\star}$ &\n$11.53\\ ^{+1.21}_{-1.04}$ &\n131.76/132 (1.00) \\\\ [5pt]\n\\hline \\\\% ----------------------------------------------------\n\n6.8 & \n$-0.47\\ ^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ &\n$0.998^{\\ast}$ &\n$25.96\\ ^{+2.92}_{-2.87}$ &\n$3.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$0.195^{\\star}$ &\n$14.1^{\\star}$ &\n$2.33^{\\star}$ &\n$8.15\\ ^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ &\n127.89/132 (0.97) \\\\ [5pt]\n\\hline \\\\% ---------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n5.6 & \n$0.51$ &\n$0.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$100.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$7.0^{\\ast}$ &\n$0.195^{\\star}$ &\n$14.1^{\\star}$ &\n$2.33^{\\star}$ &\n$14.37$ &\n407.52/133 (3.06) \\\\ [5pt]\n\n\\hline\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\tablefoot{The best fitting spectral parameters.

The corresponding results of model fitting are plotted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:optagnfit2}. The solution for the mass $M = 1.0 \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ gives very similar results for the starlight properties.\n\n\nThe shape of the disk component resulting from broad band fits, refered to as ``agn'', is clearly different from a power law. We thus made an excercise by retaining all other parameters (Fe II shape and normalization, BC normalization and the correction factor for grey-shifting the HST data) and simply replaced the power law with a new {\\sl agn} shape and normalization. The new fit from the STARLIGHT code shows an immediate improvement of the $\\chi^2$ (see Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}). We then allowed all the normalizations to vary, we also included the UV Fe II template from Vestergaard \\& Wilkes (2001) below 2500 \\AA. The results are given in the last line of Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}. The final  $\\chi^2$ is better although it does not reach the best fit value obtained with a red power law (first line in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}). \n\nThe final solution in $F_{\\lambda}$ space is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt}. The fit seem satisfactory in the optical band. In the UV part the Fe II template is probably not well accounting for the spectral features. \n\nThe same result, but in $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ space is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:optnuFnu}. Here we also conveniently plot the observationally determined disk contribution (i.e. the difference between the data and the starlight plus BC plus Fe II contribution, with masked data part removed, shown as a green line) and the binned data points representing the disk, with errors determined as described in Sect.~\\ref{sect:fitting}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\centering\n\n \n    \\includegraphics[width=0.95 \\hsize]{widma_cale_v4.eps}\n    \\caption{The best fit to the optical/UV spectrum of RE J1034+396 (red line)to the data (black line);  dashed magenta line shows the disk contribution, green line - Balmer Continuum and blue line the Fe II contribution.

This is less than in Bian \\& Huang (2010) where the disk (a power law) exceeded 50 \\% at 4020\\AA. Their analysis did not extend beyond 3400\\AA. \n\n\nThe properties of the stellar populations from our final fit are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:populations}. New fit still gives qualitatively similar results to the original paper of Bian \\& Huang (2010). Two populations of stars are thus indeed characteristic for the nucleus of RE J1034+396. Most of the light actually comes from the young stellar population, with ages 10 - 100 million years, and solar metallicity of 0.02. The stars are thus older than implied by power law fits. The stars are hidden in the highly obscuring medium, as implied by $A_V = 0.61$. The stellar dispersion obtained directly from the code is 122 km s$^{-1}$, which reduced to true stellar velocity dispersion of 136 km s$^{-1}$ when corrected for the spectral resolution of the data and instrumental effects (see Eq. 3 of Bian \\& Huang 2010). This value implies rather high black hole mass $5.8 \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ if we use the formula of Kormendy \\& Ho (2013). It is much higher than the value obtained by Bian \\& Huang (2010), $ (1 - 4) \\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, since our measured velocity dispersion in the final model is higher. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\hsize]{content_B0021.eps}\n    \\caption{The properties of the stellar populations after the final opt/UV/X-ray fitting.}\n    \\label{fig:populations}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral features in absorption}\n\nThe decomposition of the optical/UV spectrum into the disk and starlight depends on the description of the disk model. Formal solution with a blue power law is better in $\\chi^2$ term (see the first and the last lines in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}. Therefore, we take a closer look at individual spectral features in order to see which of the two models provide better representation of the data. \n\nUnfortunately, the starlight contamination in an AGN is not easy to determine just from the individual absorption features since some of the usual starlight signatures in the form of absorption lines are filled up with broader emission lines from the BLR. We first checked directly in the data whether any absorption features are actually seen in our object. We used the features recommended by Cid Fernandes et al. (1998). \n\nWe searched for these features in the available spectra. The enlarged spectra in the promising wavelength range are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:absorption}. We did not include the Ca II K + H$\\epsilon$ band $\\lambda\\lambda$3952-3988 since it is strongly contaminated by emission, and the Na I region  $\\lambda\\lambda$5880-5914 as there is no visible spectral feature. We see some traces of absorption in four bands. The Ca II K is the most clear case, additionally located in the bluer part of the spectrum. Here we see that the complex but physically justified model of the accretion disk contribution reproduces well the depth of the feature while the blue power law solution (the first line in Table~\\ref{table:FirstStage}) gives too shallow absorption feature meaning that the disk contribution is overestimated in this model. Other three features are not so deep, and both fits are comparable although formally they differ by a factor of 2 in the derived stellar dispersion value. This is because the data as well as input models are marginal for the purpose of the stellar dispersion measurement.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=1.4\\hsize]{widma_lambda_features.eps}\n    \\caption{The Ca II K, CN, Gband and Mg I absorption features: the observed spectrum (black line), and best fit power law solution (green line) and the agn disk solution (red line).}\n    \\label{fig:absorption}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\hsize]{widma_lambda_Hbeta.eps}\n    \\caption{The H$\\beta$ line, with starlight and all other contributions subtracted; the observed line (magenta) is quite well fitted with a single Lorentzian (green dashed line) of FWHM = 5 \\AA.}\n    \\label{fig:Hbeta}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Black hole mass from H$\\beta$}\n\nNew decomposition of the optical spectrum allow us to revisit the determination of the black hole mass from H$\\beta$ line. The line seems somewhat narrower, FWHM = 680 km s$^{-1}$, and quite well represented just by a single Lorentzian shape (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:Hbeta}). The line position coincides well with the vacuum line position (4862.721 \\AA) which supports additionally our choice of redshift. The Mg II line is somewhat broader, FWHM = 750 km s$^{-1}$, with traces of the doublet structure clearly visible. \n\nWe determine the black hole mass from the formula\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\log M_{BH} = A + B \\log \\lambda L_\\lambda + 2 \\log (FWHM),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\log M_{BH}=A+B\\log\\lambda L_{\\lambda}+2\\log(FWHM),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>\u03bb</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>W</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02498.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $T$ is the duration of the exposure.

The value of the coefficient\nC given above is appropriate for Seyfert 1 galaxies, but it may need to be additionally rescaled by a factor 20 for typical Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies with soft X-ray spectra.

Since RE J1034+396 is a Narrow Line Seyfert 1, the first determination should be more appropriate. On the other hand, we can say in a more conservative way that the true mass from X-ray variability should be between these two values.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\hsize]{mass.eps}\n    \\caption{The summary of various determinations of the black hole mass in RE J1034+396.}\n    \\label{fig:mas_summary}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn this paper we modeled the broad optical/UV/X-ray band of the spectrum of an exceptional Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396. The optical/UV part of the spectrum is strongly dominated by starlight emission. This is nicely consistent with no polarization detected in the optical band by Breeveld \\& Puchnarewicz (1998). Two separate stellar populations are clearly seen, as obtained before by Bian \\& Huang (2010) at the basis of the optical data analysis alone. However, the additional use of HST and X-ray data changes the fit quantitatively.\n\n\\subsection{Black hole mass}\n\nWe used several methods to determine the black hole mass in this source. The summary of the results is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:mas_summary}. Lines shows acceptable ranges, where additional parameters are strongly involved, and points show individual measurements. \n\nClearly, not all these methods give results which can be accomodated in a single most favorable result. The black hole mass measurements based on estimates on the stellar dispersion and O[III] are inconsistent with all the others. The measurement of the stellar dispersion with the SDSS data is not, in our opinion, highly reliable since the dispersion requested by the fitting changes strongly with the disk description. The measured velocity dispersion, here given as 136 km s$^{-1}$, may be by a factor of 2 lower, implying the mass lower by a factor of 16. On the other hand, the measurement based on O[III] should be quite precise. This value implies much higher bulge mass than the value expected from the standard relation between the bulge and the central black hole. RE J1034+396 belongs to NLS1 class, and there is a on-going discussion whether NLS1 galaxies follow the standard relation or lag behind in their evolution, being still at the stage of rapid black hole growth (see e.g. Mathur et al. 2001; Woo et al. 2015). The issue is additionally complicated by the rotational contamination of the stellar features (Woo et al. 2015).  \n\nAlso interpretation of the QPO as Low Frequency QPO is definitively inconsistent with other measurements. Thus High Frequency QPO interpretation is clearly favored, and both values are consistent with broad band fitting. The formal fit is somewhat better for lower value, corresponding to 2 times the fundamental frequency. It is interesting to note that in both cases the black hole spin has to be high, close to the maximally rotating solution. The object does not have a radio detection, and does not show any other imprints of the presence of a jet. On the other hand, there is no firm theory of QPO (see e.g. Czerny et al. 2010, Czerny \\& Das 2011, Hu et al. 2014, Alston et al. 2015 and the references therein). If we try to connect the QPO just to the Keplerian frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit (see e.g. Lei et al. 2015) we will obtain a broad range of possible mass, $ 6.64 \\le \\log M_{BH} \\le 7.69$ values since the black hole spin in our fitting is unconstrained.  \n\nThe black hole mass from higher HF QPO is marginally inconsistent with the range of masses implied by X-ray variability, while the mass derived from the lower HF QPO value is well consistent with X-ray variability. The caveat is, however, that to have the large mass tail implied by the X-ray variability we had to use the standard coefficient connecting the black mass with the X-ray excess variance instead of a coefficient appropriate for NLS1. Optical lines of RE J1034+369 are very narrow, below 1000 km s$^{-1}$, so the object does not seem to be a boundary case. \n\nThe black hole masses based on the FWHM of H$\\beta$ and Mg II are consistent with each other, but much lower ($\\sim 10^6 M_{\\odot}$) than the masses implied by HF QPO. Such small masses imply super-Eddington luminosities since the bolometric luminosity of the source corresponds to the value of the black hole mass  $ 2\\sim 10^6 M_{\\odot}$. Such a low value would be really consistent with expectations based on X-ray variability. Broad band fitting can also give consistent results if very low value of the spin, close to zero, is assumed. However, in this case the QPO phenomenon has no proper mode identification. It is difficult to assess at present the flexibility in the mass values given by Gierlinski et al. (2008). These values come directly from the relation for the fundamental frequency $f_0 = 931 (M/M_{\\odot})^{-1}$ Hz (Remillard \\& McClintock 2006) coming from three sources XTE J1550\u00e2\u0080\u0093564, GRO J1655\u00e2\u0080\u009340,\nand GRS 1915+105. All of them are microquasars, with black hole spin covering a broad range (XTE J1550\u00e2\u0080\u0093564, $a \\sim 0.5$, Steiner et al. 2011; GRS 1915+105, $a \\sim 0.95$ (Fragos \\& McClintock 2015, You et al. 2015); GRO J1655\u00e2\u0080\u009340, $ a \\sim 0.3$, Motta et al. 2014). The masses of these sources are also determined with some errors, affecting the scaling. However, it is rather unlikely that the error is by an order of magnitude. Additionally, with small mass value for RE J1034+396, the discrepancy between the black hole mass and the bulge mass, becomes even more profound.\n\nThis discussion shows that, despite many efforts, the black hole mass determination in extreme sources remains a challenge.     \n\n\\subsection{Dust component}\n\nToo shallow slope of the power law found by Bian \\& Huang (2010) may be related to the presence of the hot dust emission in the near-IR. The presence of the hot dust in this source has also been postulated by Breevald \\& Puchnarewicz (1998), at the basis of detection of highly ionized iron e.g. [Fe XI]$\\lambda$7892. We did not include such component in our fitting since the model is already quite complex. \n\n\\subsection{Starlight}\n\nIn this source the properties of the starlight are exceptionally well measured due to very low contribution of the disk to optical/UV band. It is interesting to note the presence of two populations although the details depend on the disk model, so the young population in Bian \\& Huang (2010) is much younger ($\\sim$ 10 Myr) than in our solution ($\\sim$ 100 Myr). RE J1034+369 is not a starburst galaxy so this kind of a starlight can be treated as characteristic for all AGN, including quasars. Frequently, the stellar contamination is modeled using only older stellar population but this may overestimate the disk contribution at shorter wavelengths. This is particularly important in extremely blue sources like a quasar PG1426+015 (Watson et al. 2008). \n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nJ\\'S, KH, BC, MK, BY and A\\'{S} \nacknowledge the support by the Foundation for Polish Science through the\nMaster/Mistrz program 3/2012.

Instead of computing the power spectrum, it is more convenient to use the excess variance directly calculated from the data (Nikolajuk et al. 2004).\nWe used the 28 lightcurves from the XMM satellite in the 2-10 keV band (see Sect.~\\ref{sect:data}). The duration of the individual \nexposures varied from 1300 s to 1.07 day, with the median value of about 40 ks. We determined the dimensionless X-ray variance, $\\sigma_{exc}$, normalized by the average flux, for each of the curves separately, and we\ncalculated the individual values of the black hole mass from each lightcurve using the formula\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nM_{BH} = {C T \\over \\sigma_{exc}^2},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"M_{BH}={CT\\over\\sigma_{exc}^{2}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
