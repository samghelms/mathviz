Hence a change in hard process PDF which is\nunmatched by the same change to the ISR PDF will introduce deviations\nproportional to the \\emph{double ratio} of the two different PDFs between the\ntwo $x$s. As we shall demonstrate empirically, this double ratio is a more\nstable quantity than the bare ratio of two PDFs\n\nand hence the effects are not as large as a pure change of PDFs\nin the hard process matrix element. Of course, the PDF effect on a single\nSudakov is not the effect on the whole event, since the splitting is iterated,\nbut the fact that ISR evolution typically only introduces one or two\ninitial-state splittings per incoming parton means that this effect is not large\n-- and by construction it is limited to the production rates and kinematics of\nsubleading jets not modelled by the hard process.\n\nThe effect of PDF systematics and {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} variations on ISR Sudakov factors was\nstudied a decade ago\n~\\cite{Gieseke:2004tc}, concluding that the\neffects of PDF uncertainties are small compared to other sources of uncertainty,\nexcept in certain isolated high- and low-$x$ regions where PDFs are\nunconstrained and their uncertainties inflate. In the sections that follow, we\nshall reprise the spirit of that study with new PDF fits, and focus on the PDF\n(double) ratios entering the Sudakov terms.\n\n\n\\subsection{PDFs between shower splittings}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tp]\n  \\centering\n  \\img[0.5]{py8/xratios}\n  \\caption{Distribution of $x$ ratios between parent and daughter partons in Pythia\\,8 initial-state parton shower evolution.}\n  \\label{fig:xratio}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:xratio} we show the distribution of $x$ ratios between\ninitial state shower splittings in Pythia\\,8 dijet simulation.

To\nachieve a balance between the close-together splittings at the low-scale end of\nthe spectrum and the larger gaps between hard emissions, and to avoid a\nproliferation of similar plots, in this section we will use an $x$ ratio of\n{\\ensuremath{\\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\xspace} (equivalent to 2 according to the definition in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:xratio}). Ratio constructions with a factor of 10 produced very\nsimilar results, which are hence elided in the interests of brevity.\n\nFirst, we look at the differences between the latest leading order (LO) and\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) PDFs from the three major global fit collaborations:\nCTEQ~\\cite{Guzzi:2011sv}, MMHT~\\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} (the latest\nincarnation of the MRST / MSTW group), and\nNNPDF~\\cite{Ball:2013hta,Ball:2014uwa}.

The leading shower MCs include non-perturbative\neffects and complex phase-space effects not available to, for example, analytic\nresummation calculations.\n\nThe price of such realism is the addition of free parameters which must be tuned\nto data, an expensive process in both computational and manpower terms. A\ncottage industry between shower MC developers and collider experiments has grown\nup around this problem~\\cite{Buckley:2009bj}, and several generations of tunes,\nparticularly for the {\\textsc{Pythia}\\xspace} shower MC family, have evolved from the LEP and\nTevatron eras up to the present point early into the second run of the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC)~\\cite{Skands:2014pea,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}.\n\nThe last ten years of developments in shower MC technology have led to fully\nexclusive event generation in which the parton shower (PS), and usually also\nnon-perturbative modelling aspects such as hadronization and multiple partonic\ninteractions (MPI), are smoothly matched to matrix element (ME) calculations\nsignificantly improved over the leading-order Born level. These include both\n``multi-leg LO'', exemplified by the Alpgen~\\cite{Mangano:2002ea},\nMadGraph~\\cite{Alwall:2011uj}, and Sherpa\\,1~\\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta} codes, the\n``single-emission NLO'' codes such as POWHEG~\\cite{Frixione:2007vw} and\n(a)MC@NLO~\\cite{Frixione:2002bd,Alwall:2014hca}, and the latest generation in\nwhich both modes are combined into shower-matched multi-leg NLO: Sherpa\\,2 and\nMadGraph5-aMC@NLO~\\cite{Frederix:2012ps}.\n\nThis computational frontier does not come without downsides: the integration and\nefficient sampling of many-leg phase space is slow, as is the computation,\nintegration and subtraction of the matrix element terms required for finite NLO\ncalculations. The major benefit of NLO calculations in particular is the\nexpected robustness of total cross-sections and many differential quantities, to\nbe explicitly confirmed by constructing envelopes for variation of\nrenormalization \\& factorization scales, and parton density functions (PDFs) in\nthe calculations. The high CPU cost of the state-of-the-art calculations means\nthat explicit consistent re-running of the shower-matched simulation for all PDF\nand scale variations is unfeasible: instead, internal construction of pre-shower\nevent weights for each systematic variation has become the standard\napproach\\footnote{Construction of PDF reweighting factors is more complicated at\n  NLO, due to the need for subtraction counter-terms with different initiating\n  parton flavours and kinematics. The weight computation is hence done inside\n  the NLO matching generator rather than by \\textit{post hoc} construction of\n  single PDF ratios as for LO events.}.\n\nWhile computationally necessary, this approach neglects the effect of these\nsystematic variations on the tuned components of the simulation; in particular\nthe parton shower (which na\\\"ively should be configured consistently with the\nPDF and scale choices of the matrix element) and the MPI model (which is not\nconnected to the hard scattering by perturbative QCD, but does display\nsignificant PDF dependence).\n\nThe same issues apply to shower MC tuning, for LO\nas well as NLO simulations: strictly a different tune should be constructed and\nused for each matrix element PDF and scale variation, but again this is\ncomputationally impractical and a single shower MC tune tends to be used for all\nmatrix element variations.\n\nEvaluating the rationale and empirical support for\nthis factorized approach, with particular respect to PDF variations, is the\ntopic of this brief note. This is neither novel ground nor particularly\nsurprising, but since a review of available literature finds surprisingly little\nmaterial on the topic it is hoped that this survey makes a useful contribution.\n\n\n\\section{PDF dependence of parton showers}\n\nWe will spend most of this study considering the effect of PDF variations on\ninitial-state parton shower algorithms, producing initial-state radiation\n(ISR). The typical ISR algorithm evolves backwards from the hard process'\nincoming legs towards the initial state hadrons, and produces only a few\nsplittings per event as contrasted with the hundreds of branchings in the\ntypical final-state radiation (FSR) simulation. These few branchings, however,\nare usually high-energy compared to the FSR splittings which produce internal\nstructure, and they are the dominant mechanism by which the collinear parton\nshower formalism can produce additional isolated jets -- albeit at a rate\nusually less than in data and in dedicated higher-order matrix element\ncalculations.\n\nAs the matrix element calculation includes PDF factors in its partonic hard\nprocess amplitudes, QCD evolution of the initiating parton legs must correct\nthose PDF factors for the changes in initial parton flavour and Bj\\\"orken\nmomentum fraction produced by the sequential ISR branchings, as well as the\nusual strong coupling and splitting function terms of a FSR shower\nsplitting. The ISR Sudakov form factor (the probability of \\emph{no} QCD\nsplitting in evolution of a parton between scales $q$ and $Q$ is hence\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n

These are typically constrained\nto within 5\\% of unity, and better than that for most of the range. A mild\nexception is seen for reweighting between the NLO PDFs at low $x$ and\n$\\tilde{q}$, where such PDFs are little constrained; and a very large anomalous\ndeviation of up to 20\\% for high-$x$ LO PDFs, particularly at low scales. It is\nexpected that these high-$x$ effects will be dealt with in the hard process\nrather than the parton shower, and also will use NLO rather than LO PDFs when\nmatrix elements are available, but the potential effect is worth noting.\n\nTypically shower algorithms, being based on leading order splitting functions,\nuse leading order PDFs. However, in the case of matching showers to NLO matrix\nelements there is a school of opinion that the shower should match the matrix\nelement in PDF choice to avoid discontinuities across the ME/PS hand-over. An\nargument has also been made for using NLO PDFs in leading-order multi-leg matrix\nelements on the basis that multi-leg MEs include ISR evolution effects which\nwould be absorbed into the fitting of an LO PDF, and this has similarly been\nused to argue that LO matching would require use of NLO shower PDFs. We may ask\nwhether it is ``allowed'' to reweight between LO and NLO PDFs, and this is\naddressed in Figure~\\ref{fig:dblratio_lo2nlo}: larger effects up to $\\pm 10\\%$\nare seen in LO/NLO gluon PDF reweighting of a $z={\\ensuremath{\\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\xspace}$ Sudakov than in LO or NLO\nreweighting between PDF families, but the light quarks are still within a few\npercent of unity.\n\nIn most typical use-cases the effect of either neglecting shower PDF effects in\nreweighting, or of using the same shower tune with different PDFs, is hence\nexpected to be on the order of 5--10\\%, comparable to the typical systematic\nuncertainty of shower algorithms (typically evaluated by variation of parton\nshower starting scales and {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} evolution). This justifies the usual approach\nof neglecting explicit shower PDF effects, effectively absorbing them into\nshower systematics instead, since the effort required for an explicit evaluation\nwould be disproportionate to the improvement in predictivity or uncertainty\ncoverage.\n\n\n\\section{PDF effects on parton showered observables}\n\\label{sec:py8cmps}\n\nIn this section we study the real-world effect of PDF changes in the Pythia\\,8\nshower MC generator~\\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs}, for two important processes: inclusive jet\nproduction, and $W$+jet production in the Run~2 LHC $pp$ configuration with\n$\\sqrt{s} = 13\\,{\\ensuremath{\\text{T{\\ensuremath{\\text{e}\\mspace{-0.8mu}\\text{V}\\xspace}}}}\\xspace}$.\n\nPythia\\,8 allows separate PDFs to be used for the hard (matrix element) and soft\n(parton showers \\& MPI) components of the event simulation, so to compare the\neffects of PDF changes in the soft modelling we use the default Monash~2013 $pp$\ntune~\\cite{Skands:2014pea} and fix the hard process PDF to\nNNPDF\\,2.3\\,LO~\\cite{Ball:2013hta}, then change the soft PDF to the\nCTEQ6L1~\\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} and MMHT2014\\,LO~\\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa}\nleading order fits, as well as the NNPDF\\,3.0\\,NLO~\\cite{Ball:2014uwa},\nCT10\\,NLO~\\cite{Guzzi:2011sv} and MMHT2014\\,NLO~\\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa}\nnext-to-leading-order central PDFs. While use of NLO PDFs in soft simulation is\ndiscouraged by MC experts~\\cite{Sjostrand:2014mcpdf}, it is not unknown and we\nbelieve that an empirical demonstration of the effects is useful.\n\n2~million events were generated for each configuration, and were analysed\nusing the Rivet~\\cite{Buckley:2010ar} \\kbd{MC\\_JETS} and \\kbd{MC\\_WJETS} validation\nanalyses, with jets defined by an anti-$k_T$ algorithm with $R=0.4$ and\n${\\ensuremath{p_T}\\xspace} > 20\\,{\\ensuremath{\\text{G{\\ensuremath{\\text{e}\\mspace{-0.8mu}\\text{V}\\xspace}}}}\\xspace}$.

First, the effects of switching\nbetween leading order shower and MPI PDFs are small, on the roughly expected\nscale of a few percent and less than 10\\% in all statistically well-populated\nregions of the plots. The use of NLO PDFs in shower \\& MPI modelling produces\nlarge differences with respect to the LO baseline setup, with variations of up\nto 20\\% in many observables, and rarely less than 10\\%.\n\nSecondly, the kinematics of objects such as the leading two jets in inclusive\njet production (which are dominated by the matrix element partons) are in fact\nfairly stable even when NLO PDFs are used for showering, but extra jets in both\nprocesses (dominated by initial state shower emissions) are more strongly\naffected. The jet multiplicities are similarly strongly affected -- particularly\nfor the NLO shower PDFs at high multiplicities.\n\nFurther effects are seen when NLO PDFs are used for soft QCD simulation, notably\nthe strong reduction of multi-jet rates and the 20\\% difference in jet masses\nbelow $\\sim 30\\,{\\ensuremath{\\text{G{\\ensuremath{\\text{e}\\mspace{-0.8mu}\\text{V}\\xspace}}}}\\xspace}$. These motivate further discussion of {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} treatment\nand multi-parton interactions modelling, and are considered in the next section.\n\nBroadly, these empirical data support several conventional rules of thumb:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the effects of the particular leading-order parton shower PDF choice\n  (without shower retuning) are limited to a few percent when considering\n  perturbative QCD objects in the bulk of phase space;\n\\item reversing this observation, providing specific retunes of parton showers\n  for different LO matrix element PDFs can only provide benefits of at most a few\n  percent in some phase space regions;\n\\item we cannot directly conclude from this data about shower-PDF sensitivity in\n  event simulation with NLO matrix elements, but as it is well-known that LO\n  Pythia\\,8 configurations can perform well in connection with NLO hard process\n  events from \\textsc{Powheg-Box}~\\cite{Alioli:2010xd} or\n  aMC@NLO~\\cite{Alwall:2014hca}, the potential performance gain is again\n  expected to be on the few-percent scale.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tp]\n  \\centering\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_eta_1}\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_eta_2}\\\\\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jets_dR_12}\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jets_dR_23}\\\\\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_pT_1}\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_pT_2}\\\\\n  \\caption{\\Pythia8 $W + \\text{jet}$ $\\eta$, $\\Delta{R}$ and ${\\ensuremath{p_T}\\xspace}$ distributions.}\n  \\label{fig:py8wjetetaetc}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tp]\n  \\centering\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_mass_1}\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_mass_2}\\\\\n  \n  \n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_HT}\n  \\img[0.48]{py8/MC_WJETS_jet_multi_exclusive}\n  \\caption{\\Pythia8 $W + \\text{jet}$ jet mass, $H_T$ and $N_\\mathrm{jet}$ distributions.}\n  \\label{fig:py8wjetmassetc}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{{\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} (in)consistency}\n\nSo far we have only considered the effect of changing parton density values,\nwithout regard for the strong coupling {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}, whose boundary conditions and\nevolution are linked to the PDF evolution.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tp]\n  \\centering\n  \\img[0.5]{pdfratios/alphasratio}\n  \\caption{PDF {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} ratio distributions between CT10~NLO\n    (${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z) = 0.118$) \\& CTEQ6L1~LO (${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z) = 0.130$), and\n    MMHT14~NLO (${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z) = 0.120$) \\& LO (${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z) = 0.135$).}\n  \\label{fig:alphasratio}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsubsection{PDF {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} ratios}\n\nRatios of {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} between PDF families and LO/NLO are shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:alphasratio} for a wide range of $\\tilde{q}$ scales from\n10--1000\\,{\\ensuremath{\\text{G{\\ensuremath{\\text{e}\\mspace{-0.8mu}\\text{V}\\xspace}}}}\\xspace}. Unsurprisingly, the biggest differences (up to 15\\%) are between\nLO and NLO PDFs' {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values; and similarly unsurprisingly the second biggest\ndifferences are between the two LO sets. The differences between NLO PDF {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}\nvalues are a relatively flat $\\sim 2\\%$ across the scale range. For many\npurposes this means that reweighting NLO MC samples between two NLO PDFs with\nnot-exactly-matching PDF couplings will induce acceptably small deviations from\na full resimulation\\footnote{LHAPDF\\,6 warns by default\n  if reweighting is attempted between PDFs whose ${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(Q)$ differ by\n  more than 2\\%.}. Between LO samples the {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values may vary more\nsignificantly, and whether ignoring this effect is acceptable depends on both\nthe PDFs and generators involved. LO {\\textsc{Sherpa}\\xspace}, {\\textsc{Herwig}\\xspace}++, {\\textsc{MadGraph}\\xspace} and {\\textsc{Alpgen}\\xspace}\nall do use the PDF {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} in their matrix element evaluation, but Pythia\\,8\ndoes not (the fixed ME default is ${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z) = 0.130$, the same as most LO\nPDFs) and hence there may be no effect at all due to an {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} mismatch in\nreweighting\\footnote{Although use different tunes for the two PDFs may well\n  change the ME {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} parameter -- \\textit{caveat emptor}.}. Reweighting, and\nindeed any attempt at naive exchange, between LO and NLO PDFs is very strongly\ndiscouraged!\n\n\\subsubsection{{\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} effects in lowest-order simulation}\n\nUnlike its predecessor, version~8 of the Pythia parton shower generator does not\nautomatically change the {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values in its parton showers (or the matrix\nelement, cf. above) to match that of the PDF used in initial-state showering;\ninstead the user is left free to choose whichever ${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z)$ values (and\nevolution orders) they like for not only the ISR and FSR showers independently,\nbut also the MPI matrix element and hadronization. The Herwig++ generator offers\nsimilar freedom, and of the three most commonly used shower generators, only\nSherpa enforces full {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} consistency.\n\nThis freedom to use different {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values in different parts of MC\nsimulations gives MC tuning studies extra degrees of freedom to best describe\nobservables (such as jet shapes) which should fall within the range of validity\nof the parton shower approach. The validity of this flexibility is argued from\nthe limited (leading logarithmic) predictivity of current parton shower\nalgorithms, which is most important for lowest-order simulation such as the\nPythia\\,8 built-in hard processes. The use of this approach in MC tuning has\nmotivated the approach taken here, where we have considered purely the effect of\nthe PDF itself and not the associated QCD parameters.\n\nThis is perhaps surprising, since na\\\"ively the parton shower {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}\nconfiguration must match that of the hard process PDF and matrix element, to\navoid inconsistency. Unlike PDF values themselves, there is no ``double ratio\nprotection'' for {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} mismatches in parton shower evolution. But for\n``Born-level'' leading-order simulation this inconsistency can again be absorbed\ninto the leading-log uncertainty of the shower formalism, allowing the mismatch\nto be countered by other tunable shower parameters such as flexibility in\nevolution start \\& cutoff scales: historically this is exactly what has been\ndone to achieve acceptable data description.\n\nIn Figures~\\ref{fig:py8jets2mass} and~\\ref{fig:py8wjetmassetc} the 20\\% lower\nrate of multijet production with NLO shower PDFs seems consistent with the\nsignificantly lower ${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z)$ used in those PDFs, until one realises that\nthis is a purely PDF effect and that re-achieving good data description through\nshower tuning with an NLO shower PDF would require use of extremely high shower\n{\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values -- into a debatably unphysical regime with even larger ME/shower\n{\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} mismatches than already gave concern.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the large values of\n${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}(M_Z) \\sim 0.13\\text{--}0.14$ often resulting from parton shower tuning\nare not badly inconsistent with the {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values used in leading-order PDFs --\none of many arguments in favour of using LO PDFs for LO matrix elements, at\nleast at lowest order if not for multi-leg hard processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Beyond Born-level}\n\nThe rise of more complete QCD calculations has cast a spanner into this\nmachinery, however. In NLO and multi-leg LO ME/PS matching, it is key that\nparton emissions from shower or matrix element can be considered as\ninterchangable, with the additional (beyond Born) partons from the matrix\nelement being neatly assimilated into the shower evolution as improved splitting\nfunctions. An inconsistency in ME and shower coupling breaks this equivalence to\nsome degree, leading to perverse effects such as the increased/reduced hardness\nof \\textsc{Alpgen} events when the shower {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} is respectively\nreduced/increased~\\cite{Cooper:2011gk}. While this is not directly a PDF effect\nin the parton shower, the strict requirement of PDF/ME consistency in {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}\nand the matching requirement of interchangable shower and ME partons.\n\nIn practice this effect is often tolerable for LO matched simulations --\nespecially when traded against the pragmatic gains from tuning the LL shower\nmodel to data -- due to the similarity of {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values in LO PDFs and in tuned\nshower configurations. But it should be far less ignorable if either NLO PDFs\nare used for the LO multi-leg ME calculation \n\nor for NLO matched configurations (obviously also using NLO PDFs), since the NLO\n${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} \\sim 0.118$ value is much smaller than the ``natural'' value in the\nparton shower. It is surprising, then, that in general matched NLO simulation\ntunes have not paid great attention to this issue -- however, unambiguous NLO\nmatching configurations have yet to be established for\n\\textsc{Powheg-Box}~\\cite{Alioli:2010xd} or aMC@NLO~\\cite{Alwall:2014hca}, the\nNLO matched generators (unlike Sherpa) for which the parton shower configuration\nis not fully constrained, and hence for now we may be conflating {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}\nconsistency issues into that larger issue of configurational optimisation.\n\nWe conclude by noting two potentially useful tools in the MC simulation kit:\nfirst, the argument from Catani, Marchesini \\& Webber~(CMW)~\\cite{Catani:1990rr} that for\nconsistency with full analytic resummation calculations, the {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} in parton\nshowers should be modified -- in the original formulation by\n$N_\\mathrm{f}$-dependent upward rescaling of $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{QCD}$. This\nprovides a motivation for using a shower {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} larger than that in the PDF \\&\nmatrix element, but it remains unclear how this can be made consistent with the\nrequirements of matching schemes.  And secondly, an ``LO'' PDF with an\n``NLO-like'' ${\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} = 0.118$ already exists -- the CT09MCS\nset~\\cite{Lai:2009ne}. Whether this is a panacea for NLO matching configurations is\nnot clear, however, since previous use of ``modified LO'' PDFs -- albeit from\nthe MRST family rather than the CTEQ one -- led to unwanted artefacts in soft\nevent features such as underlying event: explicit study of this configuration is\nneeded to understand whether such effects are induced at a problematic level by\nthe CT09MCS set.\n\nIn summary, at lowest order there is significant freedom to choose special\n{\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} values for parton shower evolution without mismatches to the PDF\ncoupling inducing anomalous behaviours more significant than the intrinsic\nuncertainty of the shower formalism. Once ME/PS matching is involved, things\nbecome more complicated, but for multi-leg LO simulation the freedom is again\ntolerable because of the substantial scale uncertainty of the ME and shower and\nbecause typical shower values for {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} are not far from those used in LO PDF\nfits. Matched NLO calculations, and particularly state-of-the-art \nmulti-leg-NLO ones, are now the front-line in this long-running battle between\nthe ugly pragmatism of tuning and the theoretical requirements of full QCD\nconsistency -- the state-of-the-art hence may not describe data as well as LO+LL\nsimulations tuned to data, but the increasing ability to calculate QCD processes\nfrom first principles (and accordingly predictivity in so-far unmeasured phase\nspaces) can only be welcomed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{PDFs in multi-parton interactions}\n\nThe demonstrations and arguments above make a compelling case that we should not\nbe overconcerned about PDF consistency between PDFs \\& matrix elements and\nparton showers, because of the relative stability of the PDF ratios which appear\nin the ISR Sudakov form factor, eq.~\\eqref{eq:sudakov}.\n\nBut a surprising effect in this Pythia\\,8 study is seen in the jet mass plots of\nFigures~\\ref{fig:py8wjetmassetc} and \\ref{fig:py8jets2mass}. Given that the the\nshower couplings are not automatically affected by the shower PDF, and that\nperturbative jet mass dominantly arises from the broadening effects of the\n\\emph{final-state} shower (whose Sudakov factor includes no PDF terms at all),\nthe observed large effect seems perverse. But we have also to consider the\neffects of PDFs in multi-parton interactions (MPI).\n\nIt is well known that as the minimum parton/jet scale, $\\hat{p}_T^\\mathrm{min}$,\nis reduced in jet cross-section calculations, the resulting cross-section\ndiverges and eventually exceeds the total $pp$ cross-section. In the usual\neikonal approach to MPI modelling, the ratio of calculated partonic to hadronic\ncollision cross-sections -- i.e. the factor by which unitarity is naively\nviolated -- is interpreted as the mean number of partonic interactions in each\n$pp$ collision, $\\mu_\\mathrm{int}$. Each $pp$ event then samples from a Poisson\ndistribution with mean $\\mu_\\mathrm{int}-1$ to choose how many soft QCD partonic\ninteractions, $n_\\mathrm{int}$, will accompany the hard scatter. Since\n$\\mu_\\mathrm{int}$ depends on the partonic cross-section at low-$p_T$, which is\nsensitive to low-$x$ PDFs, changes of PDF can have a very significant effect on\nlevels of MPI activity (i.e. underlying event), even when restricted to LO fits\nas is recommended~\\cite{Sjostrand:2014mcpdf}.\n\n\nIt is hence most plausible that underestimation of the level of partonic\nmultiple scattering, in particular due to the smaller low-$x$ gluon in NLO PDFs,\nand the absence of a retune of MPI model cutoffs and suppression factors is\nresponsible for the large effects of ``shower'' PDF choice on jet mass\nobservables in Pythia simulation.\n\nA switch of PDF in the ``soft'' (i.e. non-hard-process) components of an event\ngenerator will hence in general need to retune the MPI model. This may be\nnecessary even if restricting to LO PDFs with the same {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}, since different\nPDF families can have significantly different low-$x$ gluon distributions for\nthe same strong coupling: the changes in Figures~\\ref{fig:py8jets2mass}\nand~\\ref{fig:py8wjetmassetc} are not always negligible within the LO group,\nespecially below $m \\sim 30\\,{\\ensuremath{\\text{G{\\ensuremath{\\text{e}\\mspace{-0.8mu}\\text{V}\\xspace}}}}\\xspace}$. Luckily, previous tuning experience with the\nPythia model has shown that the maximum ``plateau'' level of MPI activity can be\nadjusted with minimal impact on more detailed underlying event observables, or\nthe parton shower, via a simple 1-parameter tune of the $p_T^0$ screening\nscale. It is hence possible to switch soft-process PDFs with only a simple --\nperhaps by-hand -- retuning, rather than needing to re-employ the more\ncomprehensive machinery needed for a full shower+MPI generator tune.\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\nThis note has presented empirical evidence for the usual approaches to\nreweighting and retuning Monte Carlo parton shower event generators for use with\ndifferent PDFs, along with discussion of some of the observable artefacts and\nphysical principles involved. We hope these plots and discussion will prove\nuseful, particularly as a pedagogical introduction and to highlight areas where\na 100\\% satisfying solution to shower configuration ambiguities has yet to be\nfound.\n\nSeveral popular rules of thumb are supported by this\npresentation. \nFor unambiguously leading-order hard process simulation, the use of LO PDFs is\nrecommended not only because of the compensation for missing LO matrix element\neffects built into the PDF fit but also for closer equivalence of the PDF\n{\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} value to the values typically obtained in parton shower tuning to\n$e^+e^-$ and hadron collider data. PDF reweighting between LO and NLO sets --\nthankfully rare in practice, although not unheard of -- is seen to induce severe\neffects due to both PDF and {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} effects and is strongly discouraged.\n\nThe smallness of differences between LO and particularly between NLO PDF ratios\nand the corresponding {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} suggest that reweighting at ME-level only, and\nhence neglecting their effects on parton showers, should be an acceptable\napproximation -- provided that the neglected effects will be covered by the\nsystematic uncertainties inherent in the parton shower formalism. Explicit\nsimulation confirms this, with neglected deviations within the group of major LO\nPDFs being restricted to $\\sim 5\\%$ at most. Even observables sensitive to\nmultiple initial state emissions, such as $H_T$ do not show more significant\neffects. This argument in favour of ``na\\\"ive'' reweighting can also be used to\njustify switching of shower PDFs in generator configurations without a need for\ndetailed shower parameter retuning -- although the typically associated change\nof multi-parton interactions PDF will necessitate some simple tune modification\nto account for sensitivity to low-$x$ parton distribution differences. The\nrelative insensitivity of parton showers to PDFs is good news insofar as it\nsuggests that a single shower MC tune made with a given leading-order\nPDF/ME/shower/MPI PDF can be reused with many different hard-process PDFs rather\nthan needing a family of tunes to cover all hard process simulation options.\n\nMore substantial than PDF values themselves may be the corresponding variations\nin the strong coupling, {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}. If propagated to the parton shower, {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}\nchanges can have a significant effect on many observables, particularly at\nLO. While generator codes may allow for inconsistency in both PDF and {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace}\ntreatment, this pragmatic freedom can easily prove counterproductive once\nhigher-order hard process calculations are used -- as is these days the norm for\nsimulation of Standard~Model processes.  The CMW~\\cite{Catani:1990rr} argument from\nresummed calculations for {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} enhancement in parton showers has some\npurchase but does not obviously play well with the need for equivalence of\nshower \\& ME parton emission in ME/PS-matched calculations. The convenience of\nPDF reweighting and weight-based systematics without explicitly incorporating\nthe effects on parton showers is for now a clear win for pragmatism, but as hard\nprocess modelling becomes more and more sophisticated we must ensure to monitor\nits evolving validity.\n\n\\vspace*{1em}\n\\section*{Apologies}\n\\emph{My apologies to all those to whom I promised I would write up these\n  studies more than 18 months ago.

Hence a change in hard process PDF which is\nunmatched by the same change to the ISR PDF will introduce deviations\nproportional to the \\emph{double ratio} of the two different PDFs between the\ntwo $x$s. As we shall demonstrate empirically, this double ratio is a more\nstable quantity than the bare ratio of two PDFs\n\nand hence the effects are not as large as a pure change of PDFs\nin the hard process matrix element. Of course, the PDF effect on a single\nSudakov is not the effect on the whole event, since the splitting is iterated,\nbut the fact that ISR evolution typically only introduces one or two\ninitial-state splittings per incoming parton means that this effect is not large\n-- and by construction it is limited to the production rates and kinematics of\nsubleading jets not modelled by the hard process.\n\nThe effect of PDF systematics and {\\texorpdfstring{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}}}{alphaS}\\xspace} variations on ISR Sudakov factors was\nstudied a decade ago\n~\\cite{Gieseke:2004tc}, concluding that the\neffects of PDF uncertainties are small compared to other sources of uncertainty,\nexcept in certain isolated high- and low-$x$ regions where PDFs are\nunconstrained and their uncertainties inflate. In the sections that follow, we\nshall reprise the spirit of that study with new PDF fits, and focus on the PDF\n(double) ratios entering the Sudakov terms.\n\n\n\\subsection{PDFs between shower splittings}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tp]\n  \\centering\n  \\img[0.5]{py8/xratios}\n  \\caption{Distribution of $x$ ratios between parent and daughter partons in Pythia\\,8 initial-state parton shower evolution.}\n  \\label{fig:xratio}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:xratio} we show the distribution of $x$ ratios between\ninitial state shower splittings in Pythia\\,8 dijet simulation. It can be seen\nthat these take the form of a power law, with most splittings close together. To\nachieve a balance between the close-together splittings at the low-scale end of\nthe spectrum and the larger gaps between hard emissions, and to avoid a\nproliferation of similar plots, in this section we will use an $x$ ratio of\n{\\ensuremath{\\nicefrac{1}{2}}\\xspace} (equivalent to 2 according to the definition in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:xratio}). Ratio constructions with a factor of 10 produced very\nsimilar results, which are hence elided in the interests of brevity.\n\nFirst, we look at the differences between the latest leading order (LO) and\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) PDFs from the three major global fit collaborations:\nCTEQ~\\cite{Guzzi:2011sv}, MMHT~\\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} (the latest\nincarnation of the MRST / MSTW group), and\nNNPDF~\\cite{Ball:2013hta,Ball:2014uwa}. These are shown in\nFigures~\\ref{fig:cmppdfs_g} and~\\ref{fig:cmppdfs_q} for gluon PDFs $xf_g$ and\nthe sum of light (anti)quark PDFs $\\sum_{~i\\in\\text{light}} xf_i$ as functions\nof $x$ at several scales from the semi-soft to the very hard\\footnote{Adding\n  light quark PDFs together for presentation as a single line is implicitly a\n  probabilistic interpretation, and hence not strictly valid beyond LO. However,\n  it is useful here since negative PDF values only appear in restricted regions\n  of phase space, and because a LO interpretation is precisely how they are used\n  in parton shower splitting and MPI models.}. These plots were made using the\nLHAPDF\\,6 parton density library~\\cite{Buckley:2014ana}.\n\nWe see that the overall scale of deviations between PDF fits are\nrelatively small -- on these logarithmic scales they are only really visible at\nvery low values of $x$, where the MMHT PDFs in particular tend to have higher\nsea contributions for both quarks and gluons, and for the high-$x$ gluon where\nthe CTEQ PDFs in particular tend to be at odds with the other two families at\nboth LO and NLO.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tp]\n  \\centering\n  \\img[0.48]{pdfratios/cmppdfs_lo_g}\n  \\img[0.48]{pdfratios/cmppdfs_nlo_g}\n  \\caption{Comparing gluon PDFs from CTEQ, MMHT, and NNPDF at LO (left) and NLO (right).}\n  \\label{fig:cmppdfs_g}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tp]\n  \\centering\n  \\img[0.48]{pdfratios/cmppdfs_lo_q}\n  \\img[0.48]{pdfratios/cmppdfs_nlo_q}\n  \\caption{Comparing summed light quark PDFs from CTEQ, MMHT, and NNPDF at LO (left) and NLO (right).}\n  \\label{fig:cmppdfs_q}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe now look at the ratios of each of these PDFs between different emission\nscales, i.e. the PDF ratio term with different $x$ values on numerator and\ndenominator which appears in eq.~\\eqref{eq:sudakov}.
