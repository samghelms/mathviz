Some individuals may disproportionately influence group movement if they occupy particular spatial positions in the group, for example, positions at the front of the group. We asked, therefore, what led individuals in moving pairs of fish  (\\emph{Gambusia holbrooki}) to occupy a position in front of their partner? Individuals adjusted their speed and direction differently in response to their partner's position, resulting in individuals occupying different positions in the group. Individuals that were found most often at the front of the pair had greater mean changes in speed than their partner, and were less likely to turn towards their partner, compared to those individuals most often found at the back of the pair. The pair moved faster when led by the individual that was usually at the front. Our results highlight how differences in the social responsiveness between individuals can give rise to leadership in free moving groups. They also demonstrate how the movement characteristics of groups depend on the spatial configuration of individuals within them.}\n\n\n\\section*{Introduction}\n\nCollective motion is often driven through the local interactions between individuals in a self-organising process (\\citealt{Couzin2005,Couzinetal2002}). By responding to the movements and positions of their neighbours, individuals can transfer information about detected threats or move together towards target locations (\\citealt{sumpter2010collective,herbert2015initiation,couzin2011uninformed}). But information does not always propagate evenly across groups (\\citealt{Rosenthal2015rev}). When individuals in bird flocks or fish schools travel in the same direction, individuals positioned at the front of groups are more likely to initiate changes in the direction of others, since individuals cannot observe the movements of those directly behind themselves (\\citealt{HerbertReadetal2011,Nagy2010}). If some individuals within a group occupy these front positions more than others, then these individuals can disproportionately influence group motion (\\citealt{couzin2011uninformed,reebs2000can}). In effect, minorities of individuals can guide entire groups (\\citealt{Couzin2005}). \n\nThere is evidence that individuals consistently occupy different positions within moving groups. Phenotypic characteristics such as body size can determine where individuals are located in groups, with larger individuals sometimes occupying positions at the front of groups (\\citealt{pitcher1982evidence}). Differences between individuals' movements may also lead to differential spatial positions, with faster moving individuals migrating towards front positions (\\citealt{pettit2013interaction, Couzinetal2002}). However, some individuals occupy positions in groups that do not seem to be related to their body size or other phenotypic differences. Burns et al. (2012), for example, found that individual mosquitofish (\\emph{Gambusia holbrooki}) occupied consistent positions within groups, and this was not related to their sex, body size, or dominance (\\citealt{burns2012consistency}). Similarly, dominance cannot explain the differential spatial positioning of individuals in homing pigeon flocks (\\emph{Columbia livia}) (\\citealt{Nagyetal2013}). In these cases, what differences between individuals determine where individuals position themselves in groups?  \n\nOther factors that are more transient within an individual may explain the differential positioning behaviour of individuals in groups. In some cases, individuals that are more informed about their environment than other group members may occupy positions at the front of groups (\\citealt{reebs2001influence}) (but see; \\citealt{flack2013robustness}). Nutritional state may also affect where an individual positions itself in a group, with hungry individuals often being found at the front of groups (\\citealt{krause2000leadership}). In these cases, and in the absence of energetic or phenotypic constraints on movement, it is ultimately how an individual interacts with its neighbours that leads it to occupy different spatial positions. Information and satiation level influence the likelihood that an individual will follow another conspecific's movements (\\citealt{nakayama2012initiative,Kingetal2011,leblond2006individual}).  If an individual ignores the movements of others more than others ignore it, then passive self assortment may move this individual to the front of groups (\\citealt{Couzin2005}). How an individual interacts with its neighbours, and in particular, whether some individuals are more `socially responsive' to the movements of others, therefore, is likely to result in differential spatial positioning in groups and affect who follows whom (\\citealt{harcourt2009social}).   \n\nHow can we measure the responsiveness of individuals to each others' movements?  Researchers have previously used averaging procedures to determine the general `rules' that individuals in groups use to react to their neighbours when on the move (\\citealt{HerbertReadetal2011,Katzetal2011,Lukeman2010, gautrais2012deciphering}). Attraction and repulsion rules, largely governed by changes in speed, appear important determinants of how individuals respond to their neighbours' locations and movements (\\citealt{HerbertReadetal2011,Katzetal2011}).  Alternatively, these rules may be driven by individuals preferring to occupy particular spatial positions with respect to the locations of other group members (\\citealt{perna2014note}). The variation in these rules between individuals, however, has not been explored experimentally, although models of collective motion show that differences between individuals' movements and interactions can influence group dynamics (\\citealt{romey1996individual,Couzin2005}). \n\nWe tested whether individuals differed in how they responded to their partner's location and movements in pairs of mosquitofish (\\emph{Gambusia holbrooki}) during their exploration of an unfamiliar arena.  We first asked whether an individual's position in the group was related to their relative size, movement profile (for example, their average speed) or information about the environment, and then determined whether differences in the social interactions between individuals could lead to individuals occupying different positions within groups. \n\n\\section*{Methods}\n\n\\subsection*{Experiments}\n\nFemale mosquitofish (n = 80) (\\emph{Gambusia holbrooki}) were collected using hand-nets from Lake Northam, Sydney, NSW, ($33^{\\circ}53'07''$ S; $151^{\\circ}11'35''$ E).  Fish were held in 170 l aquaria and were fed flake food \\emph{ad libitum}. Fish were kept for at least 3 weeks prior to experimentation. A square experimental arena (1.5 m x 1.5 m x 0.2 m) was constructed of opaque white perspex and filled to a depth of 7 cm.  In two corners of the arena, diagonally opposite one another, we placed an opaque white holding tube (10 cm diameter). For each trial, we selected two fish of similar size (approximately 1.5 - 2.5 cm) and placed one in each of the holding tubes. To test if a fish's experience with the environment subsequently led this individual to occupy positions at the front (or back) of the group, following an acclimation period of 5 minutes, we either released one (n = 20 trials), or both fish (n = 20 trials) into the arena.  If we had only released one fish into the arena, we allowed this fish to explore the arena for 5 minutes before we released the second fish.  In one of the two treatments, therefore, one fish had explored the environment for longer than the other.  We filmed the trials using a Basler avA1600-65kc camera and recorded using StreamPix (version 5) at 40 fps.  Fish were filmed for 6 minutes when both fish had been released into the arena. These films were subsequently converted using VirtualDub  (version 1.9.11) and the fish were tracked using Ctrax (version 0.5.4), (\\citealt{Bransonetal2009}). Any ambiguities in fish identities or other elements of the tracked data were resolved using Ctrax's \\emph{fixerrors} GUI. In addition to time series of each fish's $(x,y)$ coordinates, we extracted measurements related to the body length of each fish.\n\n\n\\subsection*{Analysis}\n\nWe smoothed the $x$ and $y$ components of each fish's track using a Savitzky-Golay filter (implemented through MATLAB's intrinsic \\emph{smooth} function with span 5 and degree 2) prior to all diagnostic calculations. We only analysed basic individual characteristics of each fish's motion, positioning behaviour and directional correlation when fish were less than or equal to 100 mm apart. This is because we wanted to ensure we analysed sequences when the pair was interacting, and not when individuals were exploring the arena independently.  58.49\\% of our trajectory data satisfied this condition. Further, our analysis of interactions between individuals was restricted to cases where the relative displacement between the fish was less than or equal to 100 mm in both the $x$ or $y$ direction.  \n\n\\subsection*{Predictors of positioning behaviour in pairs}\n\nWe first determined which individual in the pair was more often in front of the other (relative to the heading of group motion) over the entire trial. We defined individuals that were more often observed at the front of the group `front fish', and individuals that were more often observed at the back of the group `back fish' (see online appendix A for the proportion of time these individuals occupied different positions). \n\nWe then determined the average directional correlation between the two fish as a function of a delay time to examine the relative influence that fish had on the direction of motion of their partner when they were either at the front or back of the pair (\\citealt{Nagy2010,Katzetal2011}). We calculated each fish's speed, magnitude of acceleration, change in speed over time and turning speed for all frames when fish were less than or equal to 100 mm apart. We determined the mean, standard deviation, median, inter-quartile range and maximum value of each of these variables for front fish and back fish separately (details of all the above calculations are provided in online appendix A.) \n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Fig1_new_redo.jpg}\n\\caption{Spatial positioning of front and back fish. The heat in the plots shows the proportion of encounters of a neighbour when at different locations relative to the direction of motion of the focal fish. Focal fish are located at the origin of each plot, moving in the direction of the positive $x$-axis. Front fish (A) had their neighbour more often behind them, than back fish (B).}\\label{fig:Fig1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nWe asked which of the above movement parameters or body size was greater (or less) for front or back fish. To do this, \nwe treated all the summary statistics as paired data (front fish versus back fish) and calculated the difference in parameter values between front and back fish. We applied a Shaprio-Wilk test to determine if these differences were likely to have been drawn from a normal distribution \\citealt{ShapiroWilk1965}. If the data was normally distributed, we then performed a paired $t$-test to determine if the mean of the differences differed from zero. If the set of differences was not normally distributed, we performed a two-sided Wilcoxon paired-sample test (via MATLAB's intrinsic \\emph{signrank} function) to determine if the median difference in parameters differed from zero (see for example, \\citealt{Zar1996}). To account for the number of summary statistics that we compared (21 in total), we sorted the results of all statistical tests in ascending order of $p$-value, and adjusted the significance level, $\\alpha_{\\textrm{sig}}$, for these tests according to the Holm-Bonferroni method (\\citealt{Holm1979}).      \n\n\\subsection*{Characteristics of individuals' interactions}\n\nAfter application of a Holm-Bonferroni correction the only parameter that differed between fish that spent the greatest proportion of time at the front of their pair and their partner was mean change in speed over time -- a parameter intrinsically linked with how an animal interacts with its neighbours (\\citealt{HerbertReadetal2011,Katzetal2011}). We therefore analysed in more detail how individuals that were more often observed at the front of a pair responded differently to their partner's position and movements, compared to fish that were more often observed at the back of the pair.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Fig2_sig.jpg}\n\\caption{A The mean speed, B mean change in speed over time, C mean change in angle of motion over time of front fish (solid red curve) and back fish (solid blue curve) as a function of the relative $x$-coordinate of their partner (A \\& B) or right-left position (C). Dashed curves are plotted one standard error above and below all means in each panel. Combined, the mean change in speed over time (B) and the mean change in angle of motion over time (C) describe how an individual adjusts its velocity as a function of relative partner location. Grey regions in all plots highlight where our randomisation procedure indicated that the sign and magnitude of the difference between the front fish curves and back fish curves was unlikely to occur if fish had randomly been allocated to the sets of front or back fish.}\n\\label{fig:Fig2}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nWe first produced heat maps to illustrate where individuals were most commonly observed relative to a focal individual's position and direction of motion. We produced plots showing how an individual's speed, change in speed over time and change in heading over time changed as a function of the relative $(x,y)$ position of their partner, as well as a function of $x$ (front:back) or $y$ (left:right) only (see; \\citealt{Katzetal2011}). Again, we compared these separately for front fish reacting to the position of back fish, and back fish reacting to the position of front fish. We performed a series of calculations to estimate the probability that observed differences in data projected onto the $x$- or $y$-axes could result if fish were randomly allocated to the two categories (front fish or back fish). Details of the method we used to construct our heat maps, the projection of these maps onto $x$- and $y$-axes and our subsequent randomisation analysis are provided in online appendix A.\n\nTo determine if there were any differences in the pair's behaviour when individuals occupied different positions in the pair, we compared the median speed of the pair's centroid when the front fish was ahead of its partner, versus times when the front fish was behind its partner. This measure gave an estimate of the exploration rate of the pair when in different spatial configurations (see online appendix A).   \n\n\n\\section*{Results}\n\nFish tended to maintain positions in front or behind their partner (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig1}). The majority of encounters between the pair occurred when fish were separated by approximately 25 mm to 90 mm (in the front:back $x$-direction). When a fish was at the front of the pair, it directed group movement in the majority of cases: the time-lag associated with maximum directional correlation was positive for 73 out of 80 fish when in the front-most position ($p = 5.7841 \\times 10^{-15}$, two-tailed binomial test). Individuals led their partner, therefore, when at the front of the group. The proportion of frames that the front fish was found at the front of the group ranged widely from 0.5004 to 0.9643 (see Tables A1 and A2 and fig. A1 in online appendix A).  \n\n\nFish that had an additional 5 minutes to explore the arena were not significantly associated with being the front fish ($p=0.4119$, N = 20, n = 9, two-tailed binomial test). After application of the Holm-Bonferroni correction, the only difference in movement parameters between front fish and back fish was the mean change in speed over time; front fish had greater mean changes speed over time than back fish (see Table A5 in online appendix A for details of statistical tests applied to movement parameters and body length). \n\nWe then tested whether the movements of front fish or back fish differed in response to their partner's position. Speeds of both the front fish and the back fish were lowest when their partner was close to them ($x=0$). The average speeds adopted by front fish were approximately symmetric about $x=0$ (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2} A); front fish tended to travel at a similar speed regardless of whether their partner was at the same distance in front or behind them (for example, compare the red curve speeds when $x=50$ mm with $x=-50$ mm in fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2} A). In contrast, there was more pronounced asymmetry in the speeds of back fish as a function of their neighbour's position. Back fish tended to adopt lower speeds when their partner was located behind them, and higher speeds when their partner was located in front of them (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2} A). The differences in the speeds adopted by front or back fish when their partner was behind them ($x<-25$ mm) were unlikely to occur as a result of randomly allocating fish to categories of front fish or back fish (see fig. A16 E). \n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Fig3_sig.jpg}\n \\caption{The mean change in speed over time (A) and the mean change in angle of motion over time (B) of front fish (solid red curves) and back fish (solid blue curves) as a function of the relative $y$-coordinate of their partner when both fish were approximately side by side (such that the relative $x$-coordinate of a partner fish satisfied $-32 < x \\leq 32$ mm). Dashed curves are plotted one standard error above and below the means. Panel C illustrates the mean (across all pairs of fish; $\\pm 1$ SE) median speed of the centroid of each pair of fish across frames where front fish (left bar) or back fish (right bar) were located at the front of each pair (FIF = Front fish In Front, BIF = Back fish In Front). Grey regions in A and B highlight where our randomisation procedure indicated that the sign and magnitude of the difference between the front fish curves and back fish curves was unlikely to occur through random categorisation of fish.}\n\\label{fig:Fig3}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nFish also adjusted their speed depending on their partner's position. The instantaneous changes in speed over time as a function of their partner's position were qualitatively similar for both front fish and back fish. If a neighbour was located a short distance behind the focal fish (in the domain $-50 \\leq x \\leq 0, \\, -50 \\leq y \\leq 50$ (mm)), then the focal fish would increase its speed, acting to move away from its partner (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2} B and fig. A18, A \\& B).  However in this region, this change in speed was higher for front fish reacting to the position of the back fish (fig. \\ref{fig:Fig2}B, red curve), than for back fish reacting to position of the front fish (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2} B, blue curve). If a neighbour was located a short distance in front of the focal fish (within the domain $0 \\leq x \\leq 50, \\, -50 \\leq y \\leq 50$ (mm)), then the focal fish would decrease its speed (again see fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2} B and fig. A18, A \\& B). Once again, the mean change in speed in this region was greater for front fish reacting to back fish than for back fish reacting to front fish. In fact, the front fish's mean change in speed projected onto the $x$-axis over the range $-50 \\leq x \\leq 50$ (mm) was always greater than the back fish's mean change in speed. The magnitude in difference between the front fish's and back fish's mean change in speed ranged from close to 0 mm/s$^2$ to over 20 mm/s$^2$. Our randomisation analysis suggested that these observed differences in the intervals $-25 \\leq x \\leq -10$ (mm), $10 \\leq x \\leq 60$ (mm) and $-10 \\leq y \\leq 35$ (mm) would be statistically unlikely if fish were randomly identified as front fish or back fish (figs. A19, E \\& F). Hence when their partner was close to them, front fish or back fish adjusted their speed differently as a function of relative partner location.\n\nA fish may come to occupy the front position in a pair in multiple ways that include: swimming faster than its neighbour when they are side by side (active overtaking), maintaining its speed whilst its neighbour slows down (passive overtaking), or through these mechanisms acting at the same time.  To investigate the mechanism behind individuals adopting front positions, we compared each fish's change in speed over time (projected onto the $y$-axis) when both fish were approximately side by side (where $-32 < x \\leq 32$ (mm), that is, where the difference in the $x$-coordinates of the fish differed by up to a little over one body length). Front fish generally had a greater mean change in speed over time than their partner in this region (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig3} A). Further, front fish tended to exhibit positive changes in speed, whereas their partners exhibited changes in speed that were closer to zero, and in some instances negative (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig3} A), especially over the approximate range $-25 \\leq y \\leq 60$ mm. These results suggest that front fish tended to accelerate to either take or maintain the frontmost position (active overtaking), whereas back fish tended to continue at their current speed or even reduce their speed when the front position was in contest, in effect, giving way to their partner. Our randomisation analysis suggested that the sign and magnitude of the difference in leader and follower changes in speed over time in fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig3} A were unlikely to occur if fish were randomly allocated to front fish or back fish categories for data in smaller regions contained within the range $-30 \\leq y \\leq 60$ mm (see fig. A22, E).\n\nIn general, both front fish and back fish exhibited a tendency to turn towards their partners, with fish turning anti-clockwise (characterised by positive changes in angle of motion) when their partner was to their left (positive $y$), and clockwise when their partner was to their right (characterised by negative changes in angle of motion for negative $y$) (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2} C and fig. A20, A \\& B). The magnitude of mean changes in angle of motion  as a function of $y$ tended to be larger for back fish turning towards front fish (blue curve) than for front fish turning towards back fish (red curve) (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig2}C). Such a difference was unlikely to occur through random allocation of fish to the categories of front fish or back fish over the approximate ranges $-60 \\leq y \\leq -10$ (mm) and $20 \\leq y \\leq 60$ (mm) (fig. A21, F). When fish were approximately side by side (where $-32 < x \\leq 32$ (mm), these patterns remained, with back fish tending to turn towards their partner with greater turning speed than front fish (fig.~\\ref{fig:Fig3} B). \n\nThe median speed of the centroid of the pair differed when either front fish or back fish were in front ($p = 0.0027$, $W = 633$, $z=2.9974$, two-sided Wilcoxon paired-sample test, median difference in median speeds = 7.3128 mm/s); in general pairs moved at greater median speeds when front fish were in front versus when back fish were in front (fig.~ \\ref{fig:Fig3} C).             \n\n\n\\section*{Discussion}\n\nWhilst informational state could not predict whether an individual would occupy the front of the group for the greatest proportion of time, we found that fish that dominated the front position exhibited the greatest mean change in speed over time. Fish who occupied the front or back position in the pair for the majority of time differed in how they adjusted their velocity based on their partner's relative position. At a group level, pairs tended to travel at greater speeds when the fish that most often occupied the front position was at the front versus when the fish that tended to occupy the back position was at the front.    \n\nOur results suggest two mechanisms that explain why individuals responded to their partner's position differentially. First, the rate of turning towards their partners location suggests individuals may differ in their likelihood to copy or follow the movements of others. Individuals more often observed at the back of groups had higher turning rates to orientate towards their partner's position than individuals more often observed at the front of groups.  Back fish were also slower when they found themselves ahead of their partner than when they were behind their partner. These patterns suggest higher degrees of social responsiveness of the back fish than the front fish. The reduced tendencies of the the front fish to turn towards its partner's position and its symmetrical speed distribution as a function of its partner's anterior-posterior position suggest these individuals were less responsive to the their partner's position. Indeed, leadership through social indifference has been explored theoretically (\\citealt{conradt2009leading}). More recently, it has been demonstrated by training individual fish that in order to be effective leaders, individuals should balance their own goal oriented behaviour with how responsive they are to their neighbours (\\citealt{ioannou2015potential}). Doing so acts to maintain group cohesion, whilst also allowing information to propagate through the group allowing individuals to lead others (\\citealt{ioannou2015potential}). Differences in social responsiveness, therefore, can have large-scale implications for group dynamics.  \n\nSecond, the rules of interaction we have identified here and previously (\\citealt{HerbertReadetal2011}) reveal equivalents to zones of repulsion, or the effective range of similar avoidance terms seen in many models of collective motion (\\citealt{Couzinetal2002,Couzin2005,Janson2006,Diwold2011,FetecauandGuo2012}). However, they may also be interpreted as responses that enable individuals to occupy particular spatial positions in the group (\\citealt{perna2014note}). We find partial evidence for this second interpretation in our data.  When fish were approximately side by side, the front fish had, on average, positive changes in speed over time. Back fish, on the other hand, had lower, and close to zero or negative changes in speed when their partner was beside them. Such an effect could be interpreted as front fish acting to move to positions in front of their partners, whilst back fish being less driven to occupy those positions. A combination of social responsiveness and positional preferences, therefore, are likely to determine the positioning behaviour of individuals in pairs of shoaling mosquitofish.  \n\nWhy might fish differ in their responsiveness to neighbours or their willingness to occupy particular spatial positions? Slight differences in internal nutritional state, or differences in aerobic scope between individuals, could drive these differences (\\citealt{killen2011aerobic}). Whilst we fed fish at the same time, there is the possibility that individuals differed in their metabolic rates leading to different energetic requirements. If the less satiated individual initiated more attempts to explore their environment to find food, then such differences could manifest in reduced social responsiveness to their partner. Hungry individuals or individuals with poorer body condition sometimes lead partners more often than satiated individuals or individuals with a higher quality body condition (\\citealt{nakayama2012initiative,ost2013relative}). Generally, hungry fish tend to move closer to the front of larger groups and their satiated counterparts tend to occupy positions closer to the rear (\\citealt{Krauseetal1992,Krause1993,Hansenetal2015b}). Such a mechanism is consistent with theoretical studies where leadership can spontaneously emerge as a result of intrinsic state differences between individuals (\\citealt{rands2003spontaneous}). Moreover, internal nutritional state (hunger or satiation) has been shown to have an effect on the basic locomotion of mosquitofish (\\citealt{Hansenetal2015a}). Mosquitofish left unfed for a period of 24 hours moved with greater mean speed than those that had been fed to satiation, but unlike fish that occupied the front of pairs in the experiments described here, hungry mosquitofish also tended to exhibit greater median turning speeds (\\citealt{Hansenetal2015a}). \n\nWhilst state and body size may be important determinants of leadership, other differences, such as an individuals' personality may also result in increased or decreased social responsiveness (\\citealt{harcourt2009social}). Theoretical predictions suggest that intrinsic differences between individuals in their social responsiveness can be maintained through frequency dependent selection, acting to stabilise the roles of `leaders' and `followers' in populations (\\citealt{johnstone2011evolution}). However, whether such roles exist in large fission-fusion systems remains to be empirically tested.  We found a wide degree of variation in how often individuals occupied positions at the front of the group (50.04\\% to 96.43\\%) and this may be explained by the difference in social responsiveness between the two individuals in the pair. If individuals occupy similar social responsiveness levels, this may lead to sharing of leadership roles through `turn-taking' strategies (\\citealt{harcourt2010pairs}). On the other hand, individuals that have disparate levels of social responsiveness may simply adopt the role in the pair that matches their level of responsiveness. Whether the adoption of behavioural roles in groups has some functional benefit for individuals in groups remains to be investigated further. Here, when individuals occupied positions that they were most commonly observed in (i.e. front fish in front and back fish at the back of the pair) the pair explored their environment more quickly. This suggests that if individuals can gauge their relative roles in group, either through passive self-assortment or actively adjusting their behaviour to suit their partner's social phenotype, the pair may collectively realise the benefits of group living by remaining cohesive, whilst also exploring their environment more quickly (\\citealt{krause2002liv}). Whether social responsiveness is a consistent and heritable trait in an individual's behaviour should be investigated with future selection experiments and repeated tests on individuals.\n\nOur results highlight that individuals differ in their responses and movements to their neighbours and these differences can give rise to differential spatial positioning in free moving groups. A further exploration of the consistency and variability of these responses should now be made in detail. The ability to identify differences in the movement responses between individuals using their movement trajectories now allows us the opportunity to investigate the evolution and maintenance of responsive types in natural populations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nWe thank Andrea Perna for useful suggestions and comments on the manuscript.

Similarly, we identified all frames where the back fish was in front, and determined the median speed of the group centre across these frames. We treated the median speeds when the front fish or back fish was in front as paired samples, and performed a two-sided Wilcoxon paired-sample test (see for example, \\citealt{Zar1996}) to determine if the group's median speed differed when front fish or back fish were in front.     \n\n\\subsection*{Directional correlation and delay associated with maximum directional correlation}\\label{sssec:Leadership_timelag}\nIt is not always the case that an animal located at the front of a group is responsible for directing the motion of the group. For example, streaker bees guide honey bee swarms by flying rapidly through the upper portions of a swarm from the rear to the front of the group (\\citealt{Beekman2006,Janson2006,Schultz2008,Latty2009,Diwold2011}). To examine whether individuals guided the motion of their partner when they were at the front of the group, we examined the directional correlation of the fish (see for example \\citealt{Nagy2010,Katzetal2011}).

The biological reason behind using such smoothing is that it is reasonable to assume that small changes in the relative position of partner fish should not result in dramatically different behaviour of focal fish (on average). \n\nFor each fish $i$ in a given set, and each time-step, fish $i$'s speed at time $t$ was included in bin $(l,k)$ if  $x_{l,\\textrm{left}} <x_{ij,\\textrm{relative}}(t) \\leq x_{l,\\textrm{right}}$ and $y_{k,\\textrm{bottom}} <y_{ij,\\textrm{relative}}(t) \\leq y_{k,\\textrm{top}}$. Once data corresponding to all fish and time steps were allocated to bins, we calculated the mean of the finite entries in each bin, and rendered the results with the help of MATLAB's intrinsic \\emph{surf} function. In the case where alignment was the quantity of interest, we determined the mean angle between the facing direction of the focal fish and their partners using standard methods of circular statistics \\citealt{Zar1996} (plotted as arrows in the relevant plots), along with $R$, which is a measure of the scatter of all the angles in a set. For reference, the mean, $\\bar{\\vartheta}$, of a set of angles, $\\vartheta_{i}$, is given by:\n\n", "index": 29, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\bar{\\vartheta}=\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{Y}{X}\\right),\\label{eq:meanangle}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\bar{\\vartheta}=\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{Y}{X}\\right),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03d1</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mi>tan</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>Y</mi><mi>X</mi></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.08202.tex", "nexttext": "\nIn surface plots of alignment, colours corresponded to the $R$ value in each bin, rather than a mean.\n\nIn addition to the magnitude of turning speed given by equation (\\ref{eq:turningspeed}), we required information about the sense of rotation of fish (clockwise or anti-clockwise) to construct appropriate plots of turning behaviour. This sense of rotation was determined by examining the vertical component of the cross product of unit velocity vectors for a fish at times $t$ and $t + \\Delta t$, similar to the calculations for $\\lambda_{ij}(t)$ in equation (\\ref{eq:right_left_sign}). We refer to the quantity that combines sense of rotation and magnitude of turning speed as change in angle of motion over time, change in angle over time or change in heading, denoted $\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta t}$.  \n\nIn addition to surface plots, we produced line-graphs of the proportion of encounters with neighbour fish, mean speed of focal fish, mean change in speed over time of focal fish and mean change in angle of motion over time of focal fish by projecting data contained in the square bins (described above) onto both the $x$ and $y$-axes. Data was projected onto the $x$-axis by combining all data that satisfied $x_{l,\\textrm{left}} <x_{ij,\\textrm{relative}}(t) \\leq x_{l,\\textrm{right}}$ into bin $l$, irrespective of the $y$-coordinate associated with each data point. Similarly, data was projected onto the $y$-axis by combining all elements that satisfied $y_{k,\\textrm{bottom}} <y_{ij,\\textrm{relative}}(t) \\leq y_{k,\\textrm{top}}$ into bin $k$. As well as calculating means for the line-graphs, we determined the standard deviation of values contained in each bin, and hence standard errors (based on a sample size equal to the number of elements contained in a given bin). Denoting curves associated with fish that spent the greatest proportion of time at the front of their pair as $A(x)$ (or $A(y)$) and curves associated with fish that spent the greatest proportion of time at the back of their pair as $B(x)$ (or $B(y)$), we determined the difference in the proportions or means associated with each line graph ($A(x) - B(x)$) for subsequent analysis.\n\nWe were interested in how fish that occupied the front or back position most frequently adjusted their velocity on average when their partners were approximately beside them. To examine this behaviour we projected our data for change in speed over time and change in angle of motion/heading over time onto the $y$-axis using the method outlined in the previous paragraph, but only using data that satisfied the condition $-32 < x \\leq 32$ (mm) -- a range that corresponds to the fish being approximately side by side (up to a difference in centres of a little over one body length, see fig. \\ref{fig:bodylengths_boxplot}), and potentially contesting the frontmost position of the pair. \n\nWe performed two sets of additional calculations where one fish in a pair was randomly allocated to the set of front fish with probability 0.5 and their partner was allocated to the set of back fish, in an attempt to examine the likelihood that any of the trends that appeared in our line-graphs could arise from random categorisation of each fish rather than a tendency to occupy a given position. One set was comprised of 100 random allocation processes where all forty pairs of fish had one member randomly allocated to the pool of front fish and the other member allocated to the back fish pool; the other set was comprised of 1000 random allocation processes performed in the same manner. For each randomisation, we first produced line-graphs of each quantity (as described above) for the set of randomly selected `front' and `back' dominant fish. From these graphs we determined the differences obtained from curves for the randomly allocated sets of front fish minus the randomly allocated sets of back fish (denoted $A_{r,n}(x) - B_{r,n}(x)$) for the $n$th random allocation). Once all curves from all randomisations were determined and stored, we estimated the probability that a difference in curves would have the same sign as that observed, and that the magnitude of that difference was at least as big as that observed via a count. To do this, for each bin associated with each curve we counted all the instances where the differences in randomised front fish and back fish curves ($A_{r,n}(x) - B_{r,n}(x)$) were greater than or equal to that observed from position based identification of front fish and back fish ($A(x) - B(x)$) when the position based differences were positive, and all the instances where $A_{r,n}(x) - B_{r,n}(x) \\leq A(x) - B(x)$ when $A(x) - B(x) < 0$. Finally, when we examined projections of change in speed over time and change in angle of motion over time onto the $y$-axis for the smaller range over $x$ of $-32 < x \\leq 32$ (mm), our associated probabilities were derived from a set of 100 random allocation processes only (examination of the probabilities derived from 100 and 1000 random allocation process for other projections indicated that the tenfold increase in random allocations did not have a major effect on the estimated probability). \n\n\\section*{Online Appendix A: Supplementary Results}\n\\subsection*{Proportion of time at group front for each fish}\\label{supp:proportionoftimetables}\nTables \\ref{tab:proportions1} and \\ref{tab:proportions2} list the proportion of time spent at the front of the group by each fish in each trial. Figure \\ref{fig:totalprop_hist} contains a frequency histogram of the total proportion of time spent at the front of each pair by `front' fish.\n\nDuring our analysis we noted that many instances of occupying the frontmost position only lasted for short durations. When the front position was in contest, the frontmost fish relative to the group centroid would often swap multiple times. Figure \\ref{fig:individualdurationsinfront} A illustrates the relative frequency that unbroken durations spent at the front of the pair by either a front fish or back fish were observed. The histogram is dominated by short duration instances of occupying the front. However, the large number of short duration instances of front position occupancy only contributed a small amount to the total duration of data that we analysed. Figure \\ref{fig:individualdurationsinfront} B illustrates the proportion of the total data analysed that were made up of instances when a fish occupied the front position for a given duration. The shortest duration instances (of 0.025 seconds = 1 frame) only made up 0.99 \\% of the total data analysed, durations of front occupancy of 0.1 seconds (4 frames ) or less made up approximately 3.48 \\% of the data analysed and durations of 1.0 seconds (40 frames) or less made up approximately 13.63 \\% of the data analysed.   \n\n\\begin{table}[!h]\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\\caption{The total number of frames where a pair of fish was closely grouped (within 100 mm of each other), and the proportion of frames spent at the front of the pair by each fish.

Test results were sorted in ascending order of $p$-value, and significance levels for each test were adjusted according to a Holm-Bonferroni correction \\citealt{Holm1979} (see the fifth column of table \\ref{tab:basictallies1}). In the absence of a Holm-Bonferroni correction, fish that occupied the frontmost position for the greatest duration (compared to their partner) differed from their partner in mean change in speed over time (median difference (front fish minus back fish) in mean change in speed over time = 6.5340 mm/s$^2$), inter-quartile range of speed (mean difference in IQR of speed = 5.0105 mm/s), body length (mean difference in body length = 1.0608 mm), median turning speed (median difference in median turning speed = -6.2436$^\\circ$/s) and standard deviation in speed (median difference in standard deviation of speed = 1.5169 mm/s).
