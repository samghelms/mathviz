3$\\sigma$ \n{and {with a redshift in the range} [0.2,0.5]} as {in} our COSMOS BCD sample.\n\n{Since the diameter of {the} MMT is 2.6 times larger than that of {the} SDSS and \nthe exposure time is 5.3 times longer, the SNR criteria of {the} SDSS BCDs {were} actually higher than {for} the COSMOS BCDs by a \nfactor of 10, which is roughly proportional to 1/$z$. \nTherefore, these two BCD samples should be comparable with consistent {emission-line} selection criteria.}\nAll of the {line} fluxes of the COSMOS and SDSS BCDs {were} corrected for {galactic} foreground extinction. \nSince the spectra {continua} are marginally detected, we {were} not able to accurately determine the Balmer absorption.\n\\citet{zahid2011} {estimated} the Balmer absorption, which is $\\sim$ 1 \\AA\\,  \nin

30.2 \\AA. \n\nSince {the} R23 indicator is sensitive to dust attenuation, it is important to {reliably} determine the \nintrinsic extinction.\nIn this work, we {used the} Balmer decrement method to determine the \ndust attenuation assuming a Calzetti extinction law \\citep{calzetti2000}.\nSince the spectra are affected by contamination of second-order light at {wavelengths} longer than $\\sim

estimate the dust attenuation assuming {an} intrinsic ratio of 2.14. \nHowever, {of the COSMOS BCD {samples}}, only {38} BCDs {had an} SNR of {the} {\\hbox{H$\\gamma$}}\\ line above $3\\sigma$. \nFor the rest of {the} {36} {COSMOS} BCDs, we {used} the color excess $E(B-V)$ from SED fitting to roughly\nestimate the intrinsic extinction.\nIt should be noted that the nebular extinction {was} higher than {the} stellar extinction.\nAlthough the exact relation between {the} nebular and the stellar extinction is under debate,\nwe {adopted} a factor of 2.3 to transfer the stellar extinction from {the} SED {fit} to {the} dust extinction of {the} emission lines\n\\citep{calzetti2000,cresci2012}. \nIn the rest of this paper, we will {distinguish between the} COSMOS BCDs {using} these two

\\citep{kroupa2001} was assumed. \n{The} MPA-JHU team obtained the stellar mass based on \\citet{bc03} (hereafter BC03) population synthesis model and \n{assuming} {an} {exponentially-declining}\nstar formation history.\nThe stellar mass of {the} COSMOS BCD sample {was} determined by fitting {the} stellar population templates to 27\nemission-line-corrected broad- \nand intermediate-band {filters using} the Fitting and Assessment of Synthetic Templates (FAST; \\citealt{kriek2009}) code.\nThe original {photometric were} taken from the {photometry} catalog of \\citet{muzzin2013}. \nSince BCDs {typically} have high emission-line {EW}, we {needed} to correct the \nbroad- and intermediate- band photometry for the contribution from emission lines.\nFor each galaxy, we {generated} a redshifted spectrum with emission-lines and zero {continua}. \n{We then convolved} these spectra with the 27 filter bandpasses to determine the flux {excesses}, and {then} {removed} the excesses from {the}\noriginal photometry.\nFor the objects without reliable {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ detection, we {estimated} the contribution {from} {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ \nbased on {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ {measurements}, assuming {an ${\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}/{\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}$ ratio of 2.86.}\nTo {allow a direct comparison {with} local BCDs}, we {chose} the BC03 population synthesis model and {adopted} {an}\n{exponentially-declining star-formation} history to perform the SED {fit}. \nHowever, there is no Kroupa {IMF-based} BC03 model available in the FAST default {settings}.\nTherefore, we {adopted} a Chabrier IMF \\citep{chabrier2003} and then {applied} a correction factor of 1.06 to transfer to {the}\nKroupa IMF based stellar mass.\n\n{The} SFR {of {the} BCDs {was} determined} using the relation between {the} {extinction-corrected} {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ luminosity \nand {the} SFR in \\citet{hao2011}. Since most COSMOS BCDs have no {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ detection,\n{\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ luminosity {was} used instead, assuming {the} intrinsic ratio of {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}/{\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ to be 2.86.\n{In the burst scenario, {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ and {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ {EWs} strongly decline with the starburst age\n\\citep{leighterer1999, Izotov2015}. Therefore, to perform {a} fair comparison, we {corrected the} \nSFR to the initial stage of burst according to {equation (5)} in \\citet{Izotov2015}.\nHowever, it should be noted that the correction will be overestimated when there are old {populations} \npresent in the galaxy. The overestimation will be stronger for galaxies with lower EW({\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}).}\n{The SFR {measurements} of SDSS BCDs {were} corrected for {the} aperture effect, which {was} estimated {using} the difference \nbetween the model and {the} fiber magnitude at {the} $u$ band as $10^{(u_{\\rm fiber}-u_{\\rm total})/2.5}$. The \naperture corrections are small, with a median value of 2.8. \nWe {did} not apply aperture corrections for {the} COSMOS BCDs because the fiber {coverage} could be higher \nthan the local BCDs by an order of magnitude and the corrections must be negligible.}\n\nWe {calculated} the 4000 \\AA\\ break [i.e. {\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ index] based on the definition of \\citet{balogh1999}.\n\nSince the spectra continuum are marginally detected, {42 of the COSMOS BCDs have} reliable measurements \nof {\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ index with {3$\\sigma$ uncertainty\nless than 0.11}.\n\nThere are many methods {for obtaining} the metallicity of an emission-line galaxy. \nOne of the most direct is the so-called `$T_{\\rm e}$-method', which {utilizes} the anticorrelation between {the} metallicity and \nthe electron temperature $T_{\\rm e}$. The electron temperature can be derived from the ratio of the auroral to {the}\nnebular emission lines. However, the auroral lines, such as {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc iii}]}}$\\lambda$4363, are always very weak. \nTherefore, many empirical and theoretical calibrations are proposed. \nAlthough these calibrations are all based on {strong-line} ratios, the difference could be as large as 0.7 dex\n\\citep{shi2005,kewley2008}. The origin of this difference is still not fully understood. \n\n{In this work, we {obtained} the metallicity {using} the relation between {the} metallicity and {the} R23 ratio\nand {the O32 ratio}.}\nSince there are two metallicity solutions for one R23 value, extra information {is} needed to \ndiscriminate the upper or lower metallicity solution. The diagnostics for distinction should be sensitive to \nmetallicity.\nThe most widely-used {is} the ratio of {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584/{\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\\nor {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584/{\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$3727 \\citep{kewley2008}. However, the {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584 is redshifted to \n{the} infrared at intermediate redshift and {sky lines} could strongly contaminate this weak emission line. \nTherefore,\nother methods without the information of {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584 are needed to break the R23 degeneracy. \n{Other parameters, such as {the} O32 \nline ratio and stellar mass, are proposed to break the R23 degeneracy \n\\citep{maiolino2008,henry2013}. \n\\citet{maiolino2008} (hereafter M08) {first} calibrated the R23- and O32-metallicity {relations} by combining the ${\\rm T_{e}}$ method and \nphotoionization models.\nThen, metallicities in their work {were} derived by minimizing the difference from \nthe {expectations of the} R23 and O32 measurements simultaneously.\n\\citet{henry2013} determined metallicities using the R23 calibration from \\citet{kobulnicky2004} \nbut utilized stellar mass to break the R23 degeneracy.\nFor a subsample of 262 local BCDs which have {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc iii}]}}$\\lambda$4363 {detected}, we {compared the} \nmetallicities {determined} {using} these two methods {to that} {derived from} the direct ${\\rm T_{e}}$ method {\\citep{Izotov2006b}}.\nThe M08 method {shows a stronger correlation with the Te method than the method used in Henry et al. (2013).}\nWe also derived {the} metallicities for local BCDs {using} N2 method \\citep{pp04}, ${\\rm 12+log(O/H) = 8.9+0.57*log({\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}/{\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}})}$, which is monotonic and insensitive to dust attenuation.\n{Metallicities derived {using} the} M08 method also show a stronger correlation with {that derived {using} the} N2 method. \nIn total, we consider the M08 method to be more robust than the KK04 calibration with stellar mass for breaking {the} R23 degeneracy.\nTherefore, in this work, we {adopted} the method from \\citet{maiolino2008} to derive the metallicity of BCDs.}\n\n{We {repeated} the metallicity determination process 1000 times\nwhile the {emission-line} fluxes {varied} based on their uncertainties.\nThe median value of the 1000 measurements {was} the final metallicity and the \nmedian of {the} absolute deviation from the final metallicity {was} the error of metallicity.}\nThe obtained measurements {of all the parameters mentioned above} are listed in Table 2.\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Mass-metallicity relation}\nThe MZ {relations} at intermediate and high redshift have been extensively explored. \nHowever, most of the work {has} focused on massive {star-forming} galaxies, which can be reached at {high} redshift. \n{Recently, \\citet{henry2013} {were the first to derive} the low-mass, {intermediate-$z$} MZ relation {based on}\n26 emission-line galaxies at $z \\sim$ 0.6 - 0.7. \nMost of the galaxies in their sample {had a} stellar mass higher than $\\sim 10^{8.4} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$.\nThey obtained metallicities using the R23 calibration from \\citet{kobulnicky2004}.\nBased on the MZ relation, they utilized stellar \nmass to {chose} the appropriate branch of {the} R23 solution. \nThey found {that} the metallicity is {typically}\nlower than that at $z\\sim 0.1$ by about 0.12 dex at a fixed mass. \nHowever, {the dust extinction in their work was estimated} using SED fitting, which may suffer \nlarge uncertainties.}\n\nIn this work, we {aimed} to study the {intermediate-$z$} MZ relation at {the} {lower stellar mass} end {with {a} much larger \nand {more} complete sample}.\n\n{Figure 4} shows the MZ relation of {the} {intermediate-$z$ COSMOS and local SDSS} BCDs .\nThe {gray} dots {represent} the SDSS BCDs.\nThe red {filled} circles are {the} COSMOS BCDs with dust {extinction} corrected {using the}\nBalmer decrement method, while the empty circles {represent the} correction {from} SED fitting.\n{The dashed line is the best-fitting MZ relation {to} {the} local BCDs as:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 14747, "prevtext": "\n\n\\title{The metallicity evolution of blue compact dwarf galaxies from {the} intermediate redshift to {the} local Universe}\n\n\\author{Jianhui Lian\\altaffilmark{1}, Ning Hu\\altaffilmark{1}, Guanwen Fang\\altaffilmark{2}, Chengyun Ye\\altaffilmark{1}, Xu Kong\\altaffilmark{1}}\n\\email{ljhhw@mail.ustc.edu.cn;

\\citealt{abazajian2004}). \nGalaxies with lower {stellar} mass {tend to be less metal-enriched}.\nThey also found that the dispersion of {the} mass-metallicity (MZ) relation is {lower} than that of luminosity-metallicity\nrelation and concluded that the former is more {fundamental}. \nWith deep spectroscopic {surveying of} distant galaxies, it is {possible} to investigate the MZ relation in the early universe.\nRecently, the MZ relation at intermediate and high redshift {has} been extensively explored \n\\citep{savaglio2005,erb2006,maiolino2008,zahid2011,yuan2013}. \nWhen the MZ {relations} at different redshifts {are compared}, galaxies at higher redshift tend to be more metal-poor\nat a fixed {stellar} mass. This trend was often regarded as {the} cosmic evolution of {the} MZ relation \\citep{maiolino2008}.\n{The evolution of {the} MZ relation was also found when {comparing the analogs} of high redshift galaxies with local {star-forming} galaxies \\citep{hoopes2007,ljh2015}.}\nHowever, such {a} comparison may be significantly affected by the different sample selection criteria and different methods for \nmetallicity and stellar mass determination \\citep{Izotov2015}.\n\n\nThe MZ relation is an important\nprobe {for} the balance between gaseous inflows, outflows, and star formation. One possible explanation {for} the\nMZ relation is supernova-driven winds, which could remove the metal-enriched gas and\nare more effective in {low-mass} galaxies with {a} shallow gravitational potential. It is also suggested by many {studies} \nthat outflows are prevalent in {low-mass} galaxies \\citep{Izotov2006a,Martin2012}. However,\nthe properties of these gaseous flows are poorly constrained and the physical driver of {the} MZ relation is still\nunder debate. A better understanding of {the} MZ relation at low mass are important to fully understand the MZ\nrelation and how galaxies {evolve at the} early stage. There are many {studies of} the local MZ relation (or\nluminosity-metallicity relation) of {low-mass} galaxies \\citep{Lee2006,Zhao2010,Berg2012}.\nHowever, outside the local universe, the MZ relation at stellar {masses} below $10^9 M_{\\odot}$ \n{is not {yet} well established}. \n\nBlue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies are faint ($M_{\\rm B}>$-17 mag) objects and have distinctive compact morphology. \nStrong emission lines in optical spectra indicate that they are undergoing\nactive star formation \\citep{sergent1970,kunth2000,kong2002}. \nAccording to hierarchical {galaxy-formation scenarios}, dwarf galaxies are part\nof the building blocks for massive galaxies in the early universe. The gas consumption timescale of BCDs, given the\ncurrent SFR, is much shorter than\nthe age of the universe \\citep{kong2004}. In this work, we consistently select BCDs at {the} {intermediate-$z$ \nand local universe} and\n{investigated} the possible cosmic \nevolution of {the} MZ relation at {the low-mass} end. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2, we describe the selection of BCDs at different redshifts and the spectroscopic observation\n{of} BCDs at intermediate redshift. The measurements {for} emission {lines} and physical properties\nsuch as stellar {mass}, SFR, {{\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ }index and metallicities are described in Section 3.\n{We then} provide the MZ relation of BCDs at different redshifts {using}\nthe same metallicity determination method in\nSection 4. In this part, we also investigate the {possible evolution of {the} SFR and {\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ index.}\n\nFinally, we present a summary in Section 5.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the cosmological parameters $H_0=70\\, {\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc}^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.73$ \nand $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.27$.\n\n\n\\section{Sample selection and observation}\n\\subsection{BCDs at $z \\sim 0.03$}\nThere are many definitions of BCD in the literature \\citep{thuan1981,kong2002,gilde2003}. \nGenerally, BCDs are characterized by their blue color, compact morphology, and low luminosity or stellar mass. \\citet{gilde2003} proposed  \nquantified classification criteria to select BCDs {as follows}: 1) blue color with $B-R < 1$; 2) compact \nwith peak surface brightness in the $B$ band $\\mu_{\\rm B}<22~$mag ${\\rm arcsec}^{-2}$; {and} 3) faint with $M_{\\rm K}<-21$~mag. Later on, \\citet{sanchez2008}\nused a set of similar criteria based on SDSS filters (see Table 3 in \\citealt{sanchez2008}). \nAccording to the definition of BCD in \\citet{sanchez2008},\nwe {selected} galaxies from SDSS DR12 \\citep{alam2015} that {satisfied} the following criteria as our BCD sample in the local {universe}: \n1) blue color with $\\mu_{\\rm g}-\\mu_{\\rm r}<0.43$~mag~${\\rm arcsec^{-2}}$, where $\\mu_{\\rm g}$ is the mean surface brightness within $r_{50}$ in the $g$ band; \n2) compact with $\\mu_{\\rm g}<21.83-0.47(\\mu_{\\rm g}-\\mu_{\\rm r})$; 3) dwarf with stellar mass $M_*<10^9\\ {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$; \n4) stellar mass error $\\triangle{\\rm m}<0.25$ dex; 5) redshift $z<0.05$; 6) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$3727, \n{\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}, {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc iii}]}}$\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007 emission line\nabove 5. All {of} the measurements {were} taken from the MPA-JHU catalog \n\\footnote{http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/help/browser/browser.aspx} \\citep{kauffmann2003,brinchmann2004}.\nSince {the error of} {the} stellar mass is {not directly given} in the MPA-JHU catalog, we {estimated} the error by \ncalculating half of the difference between the 84th percentile \nand {the} 16th percentile {probability distribution of} {the} stellar mass (i.e. {the} lgm\\_{tot}\\_{p84} and lgm\\_tot\\_p16 index) in the MPA-JHU catalog. \nContamination of {the} HII regions {in nearby galaxies} {was} excluded by visually inspecting the SDSS image.\nFinally, {2023} galaxies {were} selected as our local BCD sample with a median redshift of $0.03$\\\nand a median {equivalent width (EW) {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}} of 14.9 \\AA. {Among them, 262 BCDs {had} {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc iii}]}}$\\lambda$4363 line detected at {the} 5$\\sigma$ level.}\n\n\\subsection{BCDs in the COSMOS field}\nTo study {{low-mass} galaxies} outside the local {universe}, we {selected} a BCD sample at intermediate redshift in the \nCosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) {deep} field and then {performed} follow-up \nspectroscopic observation using Hectospec on {the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT)}. \nWe {selected} the BCD sample from a public $K_{\\rm s}$ selected catalog of {the} COSMOS field \\citep{muzzin2013}.\nCOSMOS is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) \nTreasury Project to survey a {two-square-degree} equatorial field with comprehensive observations\nfrom radio to X-ray.\nWe {searched} for BCDs in a {one-degree} diameter circle centered at ${\\rm RA=150.1152, Dec=2.3420\\ (J2000)}$. \nOnly galaxies at redshift lower than 0.7 {were} selected because the {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc iii}]}}$\\lambda$5007 line at higher redshift\nwill be redshifted beyond  \nthe wavelength coverage of {the} Hectospec/MMT.\nFor the dwarf criteria, we {used the} {stellar mass $M_{*}$}, which could be accurately measured based on\n27 broad- and intermediate-band {filters}.\nTo reliably estimate the peak surface brightness,{ high-resolution imaging} is needed. Since only one HST band at 0.814 $\\mu$m is available, we\n{obtained} an image cut for each dwarf galaxy and then\n{calculated} the peak surface brightness in the $F814W$ band using SExtractor \\citep{bertin1996}. \nA correction factor of $(1+z)^4$ {was} applied to the surface brightness to account for the redshift dimming effect.\nTo roughly cover the restframe $U-B$ color of {the} intermediate-redshift objects, we use the observed $u-i$ color based on {the} SDSS filter system.\nThe distribution of the $u-i$ color of dwarf galaxies in the catalog has a Gaussian \nprofile with a median {of} 1.3, rather than {the} bimodal distribution found for \nmassive galaxies \\citep{baldry2004}. We {decided} to select the bluer half dwarf galaxies to exclude possible contamination {by} red early-type \ndwarf galaxies. \nAccording to the Mass-Excitation diagram \\citep{juneau2011},\nthe AGN fraction at $M_*<10^9 M_{\\odot}$ is negligible.\nTherefore,\nwe {did} not exclude AGN contamination from the BCD sample.\nThe final criteria for BCDs in the COSMOS field {were}: \n1) $u-i<1.3$; 2) $\\mu_{\\rm F814W, peak}<22$~mag ${\\rm arcsec}^{-2}$; 3) $M_{*}<10^9M_{\\odot}$; 4) $z<0.7$.\n\nIn total, $\\sim$ 1400 objects {were} {selected} as {a parent sample of} BCD. {We then ran} the {\\sc xfitfibs} program \nwhich {was} developed for Hectospec \nto allocate the fibers to the objects. \nEvery {pair of} objects should be separated by at least 22$''$ to avoid fiber collision.\nIn the end, 180 BCDs with a median redshift of 0.39 and 28 \nsky background regions {were} assigned {to} a fiber. \n \n\nThe {observations} of these BCDs {using the} {Hectospec/MMT} {were} carried out in 2015 February.\nHectospec is a moderate-resolution, multi-object spectrograph, fed {by} 300 fibers. \nEach fiber has a diameter of 1.5$''$ (corresponding to 5 kpc at $z=0.2$) and covers most of the light\nof BCDs at intermediate redshift.\nThe field of view is a circle {with {a} diameter of $1^{\\circ}$}.

Using Hectospec on {the} MMT, we obtained optical spectra for 180 COSMOS BCDs. \nAmong them, {74} objects {had} reliable detection of strong emission lines, which {allows} metallicity \ndetermination {based on {the} strong-line method}. \n{Of the COSMOS BCD sample, more} than half\n{had} reliable {\\hbox{H$\\gamma$}}\\ detection and {had} dust {extinction} corrected {using the} \nBalmer decrement method. The main results and conclusions {were} as follows.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item {{Intermediate-$z$ BCDs} have {R23 {ratios} systematically higher} than local BCDs, while {no \n significant difference {was} found with the O32 ratio.}}\n \n\n \\item {{We obtained oxygen abundance measurements for 74 COSMOS BCDs based on {the} strong-line method from \\citet{maiolino2008}.\n Interestingly, the {MZ} relation of BCDs at {the} intermediate {redshift} is {fairly}} consistent with {that of the} local BCDs.\n with {a} slight deviation of -0.05$\\pm$0.16 dex.}\n\n \\item {In addition to metallicity, no significant deviation in {the} mass-SFR relation {was} found between the intermediate-$z$ and \n local BCDs. On the other hand, the intermediate-$z$ BCDs {seemed} to be younger than the local BCDs, with lower {\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ index {values}. \nHowever, the deviation in {\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ index {values} is not statistically significant which may be due to the narrow {redshift} range.}\n \n \n\\end{itemize}\n \n\n\n{The insignificant deviation in {MZ} and mass-SFR relation between intermediate-$z$ and local BCDs {indicates} that \nthese relations between {the} global parameters of {low-mass} compact galaxies may be universal.}\n{These results of {low-mass} {compact} galaxies {may} {provide}} important {observational}\nconstraints {onto} {the} {galaxy-formation} and evolution model. \n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n{We are grateful to referee's insightful suggestions and comments.}\nWe {thank} Yang, C.

of {74} COSMOS BCDs {whose strongest emission lines had an SNR} above 3$\\sigma$ \n{and {with a redshift in the range} [0.2,0.5]} as {in} our COSMOS BCD sample.\n\n{Since the diameter of {the} MMT is 2.6 times larger than that of {the} SDSS and \nthe exposure time is 5.3 times longer, the SNR criteria of {the} SDSS BCDs {were} actually higher than {for} the COSMOS BCDs by a \nfactor of 10, which is roughly proportional to 1/$z$. \nTherefore, these two BCD samples should be comparable with consistent {emission-line} selection criteria.}\nAll of the {line} fluxes of the COSMOS and SDSS BCDs {were} corrected for {galactic} foreground extinction. \nSince the spectra {continua} are marginally detected, we {were} not able to accurately determine the Balmer absorption.\n\\citet{zahid2011} {estimated} the Balmer absorption, which is $\\sim$ 1 \\AA\\,  \nin {EW}, for {star-forming} galaxies at $z\\sim0.8$. \nAccording to their result, we {applied} a correction of 1 \\AA\\, in {EW} {for {the} Balmer absorption} to our Balmer {emission-line} measurements.\nIt should be noted that {such} correction {did} not significantly affect our \nresults, {as it} is small compared to the EW({\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}) of COSMOS {BCDs, with a median value of} 30.2 \\AA. \n\nSince {the} R23 indicator is sensitive to dust attenuation, it is important to {reliably} determine the \nintrinsic extinction.\nIn this work, we {used the} Balmer decrement method to determine the \ndust attenuation assuming a Calzetti extinction law \\citep{calzetti2000}.\nSince the spectra are affected by contamination of second-order light at {wavelengths} longer than $\\sim 8200$\\AA,  \nthe {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ line can not be detected or reliably flux calibrated for BCDs at $z>0.25$.\nFor consistency, we {used} the {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}/{\\hbox{H$\\gamma$}}\\ ratio to estimate the dust attenuation assuming {an} intrinsic ratio of 2.14. \nHowever, {of the COSMOS BCD {samples}}, only {38} BCDs {had an} SNR of {the} {\\hbox{H$\\gamma$}}\\ line above $3\\sigma$. \nFor the rest of {the} {36} {COSMOS} BCDs, we {used} the color excess $E(B-V)$ from SED fitting to roughly\nestimate the intrinsic extinction.\nIt should be noted that the nebular extinction {was} higher than {the} stellar extinction.\nAlthough the exact relation between {the} nebular and the stellar extinction is under debate,\nwe {adopted} a factor of 2.3 to transfer the stellar extinction from {the} SED {fit} to {the} dust extinction of {the} emission lines\n\\citep{calzetti2000,cresci2012}. \nIn the rest of this paper, we will {distinguish between the} COSMOS BCDs {using} these two {extinction} determination {methods}.\nThe extinction-corrected {emission-line} fluxes are listed in Table 1.\nWe do not provide an {estimate} of {the} uncertainties of {the} extinction from {the} SED {fit} which {was}\nstrongly {dependent upon the} other SED fitting parameters.\n{Of the COSMOS BCDs with dust extinction corrected {using the} Balmer decrement method, {two-thirds exhibited} \nnegligible dust extinction ($A_{\\rm V}=0$).}\n\n\n{In these cases,} the uncertainties of {the} dust extinction can not be precisely determined.\nTherefore, we {did} not propagate the uncertainties {of {the}\ndust extinction} to {that of} the extinction-corrected {emission-line} fluxes.\n\n{The extinction E(B-V) would be negative for galaxies with {an} {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}/{\\hbox{H$\\gamma$}}\\ ratio {of} less than 2.14. \nIn these cases, we manually set the extinction to 0 {since the dust extinction\n{seemed} to be negligible, which {was} indicated by the {relatively} low {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}/{\\hbox{H$\\gamma$}}\\ ratio}.\n{Figure 3} shows the R23 and O32 (O32=log({\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc

BCD sample {was} taken from the MPA-JHU catalog where a Kroupa IMF \\citep{kroupa2001} was assumed. \n{The} MPA-JHU team obtained the stellar mass based on \\citet{bc03} (hereafter BC03) population synthesis model and \n{assuming} {an} {exponentially-declining}\nstar formation history.\nThe stellar mass of {the} COSMOS BCD sample {was} determined by fitting {the} stellar population templates to 27\nemission-line-corrected broad- \nand intermediate-band {filters using} the Fitting and Assessment of Synthetic Templates (FAST; \\citealt{kriek2009}) code.\nThe original {photometric were} taken from the {photometry} catalog of \\citet{muzzin2013}. \nSince BCDs {typically} have high emission-line {EW}, we {needed} to correct the \nbroad- and intermediate- band photometry for the contribution from emission lines.\nFor each galaxy, we {generated} a redshifted spectrum with emission-lines and zero {continua}. \n{We then convolved} these spectra with the 27 filter bandpasses to determine the flux {excesses}, and {then} {removed} the excesses from {the}\noriginal photometry.\nFor the objects without reliable {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ detection, we {estimated} the contribution {from} {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ \nbased on {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ {measurements}, assuming {an ${\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}/{\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}$ ratio of 2.86.}\nTo {allow a direct comparison {with} local BCDs}, we {chose} the BC03 population synthesis model and {adopted} {an}\n{exponentially-declining star-formation} history to perform the SED {fit}. \nHowever, there is no Kroupa {IMF-based} BC03 model available in the FAST default {settings}.\nTherefore, we {adopted} a Chabrier IMF \\citep{chabrier2003} and then {applied} a correction factor of 1.06 to transfer to {the}\nKroupa IMF based stellar mass.\n\n{The} SFR {of {the} BCDs {was} determined} using the relation between {the} {extinction-corrected} {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ luminosity \nand {the} SFR in \\citet{hao2011}. Since most COSMOS BCDs have no {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ detection,\n{\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ luminosity {was} used instead, assuming {the} intrinsic ratio of {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}/{\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ to be 2.86.\n{In the burst scenario, {\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\ and {\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}\\ {EWs} strongly decline with the starburst age\n\\citep{leighterer1999, Izotov2015}. Therefore, to perform {a} fair comparison, we {corrected the} \nSFR to the initial stage of burst according to {equation (5)} in \\citet{Izotov2015}.\nHowever, it should be noted that the correction will be overestimated when there are old {populations} \npresent in the galaxy. The overestimation will be stronger for galaxies with lower EW({\\hbox{H$\\beta$}}).}\n{The SFR {measurements} of SDSS BCDs {were} corrected for {the} aperture effect, which {was} estimated {using} the difference \nbetween the model and {the} fiber magnitude at {the} $u$ band as $10^{(u_{\\rm fiber}-u_{\\rm total})/2.5}$. The \naperture corrections are small, with a median value of 2.8. \nWe {did} not apply aperture corrections for {the} COSMOS BCDs because the fiber {coverage} could be higher \nthan the local BCDs by an order of magnitude and the corrections must be negligible.}\n\nWe {calculated} the 4000 \\AA\\ break [i.e. {\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ index] based on the definition of \\citet{balogh1999}.\n\nSince the spectra continuum are marginally detected, {42 of the COSMOS BCDs have} reliable measurements \nof {\\hbox{$D_{\\rm n}$(4000)}}\\ index with {3$\\sigma$ uncertainty\nless than 0.11}.\n\nThere are many methods {for obtaining} the metallicity of an emission-line galaxy. \nOne of the most direct is the so-called `$T_{\\rm e}$-method', which {utilizes} the anticorrelation between {the} metallicity and \nthe electron temperature $T_{\\rm e}$. The electron temperature can be derived from the ratio of the auroral to {the}\nnebular emission lines. However, the auroral lines, such as {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc iii}]}}$\\lambda$4363, are always very weak. \nTherefore, many empirical and theoretical calibrations are proposed. \nAlthough these calibrations are all based on {strong-line} ratios, the difference could be as large as 0.7 dex\n\\citep{shi2005,kewley2008}. The origin of this difference is still not fully understood. \n\n{In this work, we {obtained} the metallicity {using} the relation between {the} metallicity and {the} R23 ratio\nand {the O32 ratio}.}\nSince there are two metallicity solutions for one R23 value, extra information {is} needed to \ndiscriminate the upper or lower metallicity solution. The diagnostics for distinction should be sensitive to \nmetallicity.\nThe most widely-used {is} the ratio of {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584/{\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}}\\\nor {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584/{\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$3727 \\citep{kewley2008}. However, the {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584 is redshifted to \n{the} infrared at intermediate redshift and {sky lines} could strongly contaminate this weak emission line. \nTherefore,\nother methods without the information of {\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}$\\lambda$6584 are needed to break the R23 degeneracy. \n{Other parameters, such as {the} O32 \nline ratio and stellar mass, are proposed to break the R23 degeneracy \n\\citep{maiolino2008,henry2013}. \n\\citet{maiolino2008} (hereafter M08) {first} calibrated the R23- and O32-metallicity {relations} by combining the ${\\rm T_{e}}$ method and \nphotoionization models.\nThen, metallicities in their work {were} derived by minimizing the difference from \nthe {expectations of the} R23 and O32 measurements simultaneously.\n\\citet{henry2013} determined metallicities using the R23 calibration from \\citet{kobulnicky2004} \nbut utilized stellar mass to break the R23 degeneracy.\nFor a subsample of 262 local BCDs which have {\\hbox{[O\\,{\\sc iii}]}}$\\lambda$4363 {detected}, we {compared the} \nmetallicities {determined} {using} these two methods {to that} {derived from} the direct ${\\rm T_{e}}$ method {\\citep{Izotov2006b}}.\nThe M08 method {shows a stronger correlation with the Te method than the method used in Henry et al. (2013).}\nWe also derived {the} metallicities for local BCDs {using} N2 method \\citep{pp04}, ${\\rm 12+log(O/H) = 8.9+0.57*log({\\hbox{[N\\,{\\sc ii}]}}/{\\hbox{H$\\alpha$}})}$, which is monotonic and insensitive to dust attenuation.\n{Metallicities derived {using} the} M08 method also show a stronger correlation with {that derived {using} the} N2 method. \nIn total, we consider the M08 method to be more robust than the KK04 calibration with stellar mass for breaking {the} R23 degeneracy.\nTherefore, in this work, we {adopted} the method from \\citet{maiolino2008} to derive the metallicity of BCDs.}\n\n{We {repeated} the metallicity determination process 1000 times\nwhile the {emission-line} fluxes {varied} based on their uncertainties.\nThe median value of the 1000 measurements {was} the final metallicity and the \nmedian of {the} absolute deviation from the final metallicity {was} the error of metallicity.}\nThe obtained measurements {of all the parameters mentioned above} are listed in Table 2.\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Mass-metallicity relation}\nThe MZ {relations} at intermediate and high redshift have been extensively explored. \nHowever, most of the work {has} focused on massive {star-forming} galaxies, which can be reached at {high} redshift. \n{Recently, \\citet{henry2013} {were the first to derive} the low-mass, {intermediate-$z$} MZ relation {based on}\n26 emission-line galaxies at $z \\sim$ 0.6 - 0.7. \nMost of the galaxies in their sample {had a} stellar mass higher than $\\sim 10^{8.4} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$.\nThey obtained metallicities using the R23 calibration from \\citet{kobulnicky2004}.\nBased on the MZ relation, they utilized stellar \nmass to {chose} the appropriate branch of {the} R23 solution. \nThey found {that} the metallicity is {typically}\nlower than that at $z\\sim 0.1$ by about 0.12 dex at a fixed mass. \nHowever, {the dust extinction in their work was estimated} using SED fitting, which may suffer \nlarge uncertainties.}\n\nIn this work, we {aimed} to study the {intermediate-$z$} MZ relation at {the} {lower stellar mass} end {with {a} much larger \nand {more} complete sample}.\n\n{Figure 4} shows the MZ relation of {the} {intermediate-$z$ COSMOS and local SDSS} BCDs .\nThe {gray} dots {represent} the SDSS BCDs.\nThe red {filled} circles are {the} COSMOS BCDs with dust {extinction} corrected {using the}\nBalmer decrement method, while the empty circles {represent the} correction {from} SED fitting.\n{The dashed line is the best-fitting MZ relation {to} {the} local BCDs as:\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n12+{\\rm log(O/H)}=4.55(\\pm0.10)+0.46(\\pm0.01)\\times {\\rm M_*} .\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"12+{\\rm log(O/H)}=4.55(\\pm 0.10)+0.46(\\pm 0.01)\\times{\\rm M_{*}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>12</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">O</mi><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">H</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>4.55</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.10</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>0.46</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.01</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mi><mo>*</mo></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
