Examples are the demonstration of negative index materials and, more recently, significant attention has been devoted to the behaviour of light in a medium with zero dielectric permittivity. We will refer to these materials as Epsilon-Equal-to-Zero (EEZ) materials with the implicit assumption that in all passive materials, the EEZ condition will only be met for the real part of the permittivity, $\\varepsilon '$, (as a result of absorption that will always imply that the imaginary part is greater than zero) and at one single wavelength (due to dispersion). Such EEZ materials may either occur naturally at the plasma frequency or may result from engineering the propagation medium, for example so that light propagates in a waveguide near the cutoff frequency. Another option, investigated here, is to create a metamaterial (MM) made of deeply subwavelength alternating layers of dielectric and metal with thicknesses that are chosen such that $\\varepsilon '$ is zero at a chosen wavelength. \nThe linear properties of EEZ, often referred to as Epsilon-Near-Zero (ENZ) metamaterials  have been investigated in depth with a range of applications for example in novel waveguiding regimes  and for controlling the radiation pattern of electromagnetic sources \\cite{alu1,alu2,eps0_1,eps0_2,eps0_3,eps0_4,eps0_5,eps0_6,eps0_7,eps0_8,eps0_9,eps0_11,eps0_12,eps0_15,eps0_14}.\t\nThe ENZ condition  has also been predicted to have far-reaching consequences in terms of the effective optical nonlinearity of the metamaterial, but with limited experimental evidences \\cite{eps0_13,ciattoni:2010,ciattoni2,ciattoni3,Ciattoni:10,zayats,Rizza_11,Suchowski:2013fa,husakou}. A compelling experimental evidence of the role of ENZ properties affecting the optical nonlinearity is the recent demonstration of efficient third harmonic generation due to the enhancement of the pump electric field longitudinal component in a uniform film of Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) \\cite{ITO}.\\\\\nA different, yet related area of study, is the search for materials that can be optically controlled so as to exhibit a sharp and rapid transition from metallic to dielectric (or vice versa), thus implying a fundamental change in the material properties. Examples that have been investigated and observed in literature are optically induced phase transitions (for example in Vanadium Oxide and other compounds) \\cite{VO2} or sudden increase in conductivity in glass when optically pumped with single cycle pulses, close to the breakdown damage threshold \\cite{Krausz_nature1,Krausz_nature2}. A metal-to-dielectric transition has also been theoretically proposed in metallo-dielectric stacks, obtained by optically pumping close to the EEZ wavelength \\cite{husakou} with relatively fast $\\sim1$ ps response times.\nHere we experimentally investigate the optical behaviour of MMs made of deeply subwavelength alternating layers of fused silica glass and silver with thicknesses that are chosen such that $\\varepsilon '=0$ in the near-infrared region, as shown  in Fig.~\\ref{fig1}. We show that by optically pumping the MM far from the EEZ wavelength, it is possible to induce a marked and rapid (on the same time scale of the 100 fs pump pulse) transition from metallic ($\\varepsilon '<0$) to dielectric ($\\varepsilon '>0$). By changing the layer thickness of the MM we can also control the wavelength at which this transition occurs. Remarkably we find that the metal-dielectric transition occurs linearly as a function of the pump intensity. We show that this fact allows to  describe the optical behaviour in terms of a standard third order nonlinear susceptibility. Our measurement technique provides the full complex amplitude across a wide spectral range centred at the EEZ wavelength.\n\n\n\\section*{Results}\nWe fabricated the metamaterial samples by electron beam deposition of alternating layers of Ag and SiO$_2$ on a thick (1 mm) SiO$_2$ substrate with a total of 10 layers. The Ag thickness in each layer is kept at 5 nm whilst the  SiO$_2$ thickness is the same in each layer and tuned to 80-70 nm in order to provide the ENZ condition around 820-890 nm, in the centre of our laser tuning region. To obtain smooth continuous layers of silver on silica below the standard percolation limit, we seeded the deposition of each metal layer with 0.7 nm of Germanium \\cite{Shalaev_10}. Figures~\\ref{fig1}(a) and (b) show a photograph of one of the samples and an SEM image of the multilayer structure, respectively. More details on the fabrication process are provided in the Methods section.\n\n\\subsection*{Linear response}\nThe linear response (real and imaginary part of $\\varepsilon$, $\\varepsilon '$ and $\\varepsilon ''$, respectively) was measured by a standard reflection/transmission measurement (see Methods for details) and is shown as the dashed lines in Figs.~\\ref{fig1}(c) and (d) for two different samples  with SiO$_2$ thickness equal to 80 nm (referred to as ``sample A'' in the following) and 70 nm (``sample B''), respectively. $\\varepsilon '$ is measured to be zero at 885 nm (sample A) and 820 nm (sample B).\\\\\nUnder the approximation of deeply subwavelength films, light polarised parallel to the film does not interact with each individual layer of the multilayer structure but rather with an effective homogenised medium whose complex dielectric susceptibility is given by $\n\\chi_{\\rm eff}=(l_{\\rm d}\\chi_{\\rm d}+l_{\\rm m}\\chi_{\\rm m})/(l_{\\rm d}+l_{ \\rm m})$\nwhere $\\chi$ may represent either the linear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(1)}$ or also the third order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(3)}$ \\cite{sipe:1992}. $l$ indicates the thickness of the individual layer and the subscripts d and m refer to the dielectric and metal layers, respectively.\\\\\nThe solid lines in Figs.~\\ref{fig1}(c) and (d) show the predictions for a homogenised material and are in excellent agreement with the measured data between 750 nm  and 920 nm, thus indicating that in this wavelength region the metamaterial is indeed behaving as an effectively uniform and homogenised medium.\n\\begin{figure}[hbt!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figure1}\n\\caption{ {\\bf Pictures of the sample and linear characterisation.} (a) Photograph of the metamaterial sample, (b) SEM image of the metamaterial sample showing the alternating layers of metal (Ag, 5 nm)  and dielectric (SiO$_2$, 70 nm) with 35 nm top and bottom layers of SiO$_2$. The laser exciting the material nonlinear response is directed along the surface normal and is polarised parallel to the surface.  (c) The measured metamaterial linear dielectric permittivity (retrieved by fitting the experimental transmission and reflection spectra): real ($\\varepsilon '$, red dashed curve) and imaginary ($\\varepsilon ''$, blue dashed curve) parts.

(d)  Same as in (c) with slightly tuned SiO$_2$ thickness so that the EEZ wavelength is shifted to 820 nm. \\label{fig1}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection*{Nonlinear response}\nWe measured the nonlinear response of the metamaterial by monitoring the changes in reflectivity, $\\Delta R=R-R_{\\rm lin}$, and transmissivity, $\\Delta T=T-T_{\\rm lin}$, in a pump and probe experiment (where $R_{\\rm lin}$ and $T_{\\rm lin}$ are the linear --without the pump-- reflectivity and transmissivity, respectively).\n The pump (with a fixed wavelength of 785 nm, pulse duration 100 fs, horizontally polarised) is at normal incidence on the sample and the probe (wavelength tuned in the 700-1000 nm region, 100 fs pulse duration, 50 Hz repetition rate, vertically polarised) is incident at a small $\\sim1$ deg. angle with respect to the pump. The pump-probe delay was  adjusted to maximise the nonlinear effect i.e. was zero within the precision of the pulse duration. The probe power is always kept extremely low so that alone it does not induce any nonlinear effects whilst the pump power is varied between zero (pump blocked) and $\\sim30$ GW/cm$^2$. \n \nTwo sets of measurements for pump intensities of 20 GW/cm$^2$ and 10 GW/cm$^2$ are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(a) and (b) for samples A and B, respectively. We  note that there is a clear step-like increase in the normalised $\\Delta R/R_{\\rm lin}$ as the probe  is tuned across the EEZ wavelength. We didn't observe any variation in the transmissivity ($\\Delta T=0$) within the noise limits of our measurements (a few percent).\n \\begin{figure}[bt]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figure2}\n\\caption{{\\bf Experimental results: nonlinear (pumped) reflectivity as a function of the probe wavelength.}  Pump and probe reflectivity variation for the two metamaterial samples [sample A (a) and sample B in (b)] around the EEZ wavelength (indicated with a vertical dashed line). The pump wavelength is kept fixed at 785 nm whilst the probe wavelength is varied (horizontal axis). The pump intensity is 20 GW/cm$^2$ and 10 GW/cm$^2$, for sample A and B, respectively. The data show a step-like behaviour in proximity to the EEZ wavelength. \\label{fig2}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\\\\\nAs we will show in the following, different effects contribute to the change in reflectivity $\\Delta R/R_{\\rm lin}$, including the dispersion of the $\\chi^{(3)}$ and the transition through the EEZ wavelength. A more thorough analysis of the variation of the permittivity with the pump intensity and probe wavelength is therefore required to unveil the underlying processes.\nWe thus extend the same method followed to extract the linear permittivity $\\varepsilon$ from $R_{\\rm lin}$ and $T_{\\rm lin}$, to also extract $\\varepsilon$ in the presence of the pump: the values of the reflectivity and transmissivity in the nonlinear (pumped) case allow to retrieve the nonlinear (pumped) value of the permittivity. In particular, here we are interested in the behaviour just above the EEZ wavelength: as can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig1}, here the unpumped $\\varepsilon '$ is negative. In the presence of a positive and sufficiently large increase in $\\varepsilon '$ due to the optical pump we may predict that the permittivity will transition from below to above zero. Figure~\\ref{fig3a} shows $\\varepsilon '$ as a function of pump intensity for sample A  and sample B, measured at 890 nm and 825 nm, respectively (in both cases, 5 nm above the EEZ wavelength). As can be seen, in both cases the permittivity transitions from negative to positive, thus indicating a transition of the medium from metallic to dielectric. The total variation $\\Delta\\varepsilon '\\sim0.05$ is of the same order of the absolute value of the permittivity itself, implying a relatively large bandwidth of $\\sim10$ nm over which the optically-induced metal-dielectric transition occurs for the maximum pump power (limited by material damage). In the inset (a) to Fig.~\\ref{fig3a} we also show the corresponding imaginary parts of the permittivity that also increase with pump intensity. Inset (b) shows $\\varepsilon '$ as a function of the relative pump-probe delay measured on sample A for a pump power of 17 GW/cm$^2$: the rise time is of the order of the 100 fs pump pulse duration (followed by a decay time of a few ps that is typical for Ag). We see that by tuning the delay, it is possibly to tune the precise value of $\\varepsilon '$, crossing from metal to dielectric and back and again.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{figure3}\n\\caption{{\\bf Nonlinear (pumped) behaviour of the permittivity.} Real part of ${\\varepsilon}$ (${\\varepsilon} '$) versus input pump intensity for sample A (blue circles) and B (red squares).

The error bars have been evaluated as standard deviation over 10 samples. \\label{fig3a}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\\\\\nA notable feature of this data is the clear linear dependence of both $\\varepsilon '$ and $\\varepsilon ''$ with pump power (in disagreement for example with the theoretical predictions of Husakou et al.~\\cite{husakou}): the dashed lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig3a} represent linear fits to the data, which are seen to pass through the value measured in the absence of the pump (and reported in Fig.~\\ref{fig1}, as expected). We also note that this linear behaviour was observed over a wide range of wavelengths (700 nm to 1000 nm, data not shown).  This feature is remarkable as it allows us to relate the behaviour of the MM and the transition from metal to dielectric in terms of a standard third order nonlinear susceptibility,  $\\chi^{(3)}$ \\cite{boyd}.

Using the same method we also characterised the linear permittivity of SiO$_2$ and that of a single Ge/Ag bilayer, which were then used to calculate the effective index permittivity of the homogenised stack.\\\\\n\n\\noindent\n{\\bf Nonlinear characterisation}\nThe material polarisation at the probe wavelength is given by \n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nP({\\omega_{\\rm pr}})= {\\varepsilon}_0 \\left[{\\varepsilon}({\\omega_{\\rm pr}},I_p)-1\\right] E({\\omega_{\\rm pr}})\\,,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"P({\\omega_{\\rm pr}})={\\varepsilon}_{0}\\left[{\\varepsilon}({\\omega_{\\rm pr}},I_%&#10;{p})-1\\right]E({\\omega_{\\rm pr}})\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>pr</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b5</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b5</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>pr</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>pr</mi></msub><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07088.tex", "nexttext": "\nbeing $n_p$  the real part of the medium refractive index at the pump frequency.
