In particular they play an important role on the AdS boundary in the context\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence and holography.\nE.g. three-dimensional AdS space  possesses\nan infinite-dimensional, asymptotic  $W$-symmetry \\cite{Brown:1986nw}, which is holographically realized as symmetry group of the two-dimensional conformal field theory that lives on the\nboundary of the AdS space. In four space-time dimensions, the  BMS supertranslations were already introduced in 1962 by Bondi, \nvan der Burg, Metzner and Sachs \\cite{bms} (for more work on asymptotic symmetries in gravity see \\cite{asym}).\nThese infinite-dimensional BMS transformations\ndescribe the  symmetries of asymptotically-flat space-times at future or past \nnull-infinity, denoted by ${\\mathscr I}^+$  and ${\\mathscr I}^-$ respectively. Hence the BMS groups \n$BMS^\\pm$ describe the \nsymmetries on ${\\mathscr I}^+$  and ${\\mathscr I}^-$, but in general not on the interior of four-dimensional space-time. Furthermore, if one considers a gravitational scattering process\n(an S-matrix in Quantum\nField Theory) on asymptotically flat spaces, there is a non-trivial intertwining between $BMS^+$ and $BMS^-$ (see first reference in \\cite{asym}).\n\nHowever holography using black holes is independent of asymptotic boundaries but originates from considerations of the black hole horizon. \nThis suggests that a more general set up should be\npossible, extending the concept of symmetries also to the horizon of black hole.\nRecently it was conjectured \\cite{Strominger:2013jfa} (for other recent work on BMS symmetries, gravitational memory and the relation to soft theorems in scattering\namplitudes see \\cite{strom})\nthat the BMS symmetry will play an important role in resolving the so called black hole information paradox by providing an (infinite-dimensional) hair, i.e.\ncharges \nto the black hole, that carry the information about the collapsing matter before the black hole is formed. Moreover it was argued \\cite{Hawking:2015qqa} that the BMS group can can be extended\nas symmetry group  $BMS^{\\cal H}$ to the horizon ${\\cal H}$ of a Schwarzschild black hole. \nHowever the relation between $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and the standard BMS groups $BMS^\\pm$ is still rather unclear. Also what is the action of $BMS^{\\cal H}$ on the mass of the black hole\nwas so far not yet discussed.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper we will explicitly construct the supertranslations $BMS^{\\cal H}$ on the event horizon ${\\cal H}$ of a Schwarzschild black hole with metric written in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates\\footnote{For additional recent work on infinite (BMS-like) symmetries on black hole horizon see \\cite{bmshor}.} In addition there are still the  standard BMS transformation $BMS^-$ acting on the past null infinity surface ${\\mathscr I}^-$ of the black hole geometry. \nWorking out the relation between $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and  $BMS^-$,\nit is possible\nto entangle  the transformations $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and $BMS^-$ in  a non-trivial way. Namely we will show that the horizon supertranslations $BMS^{\\cal H}$ \ncontain a part that cannot be compensated by $BMS^-$ transformations. This part of supertranslations\non ${\\cal H}$, which can be \nformally denoted by $\\cal A \\equiv BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$, act only on the horizon of the black hole and take the form of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on the black hole event horizon ${\\cal H}$.\nWe will show that these $\\cal A$-supertranslations leave the ADM mass of the black hole invariant. Using this information we can explicitly construct the Bogoliubov/Goldstone-type \nmodes that correspond to the $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$ transformations on the Schwarzschild metric, and show in this way that these modes are classically gapless.\n\n\nAs we shall argue, the transformations $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$\nare those that give raise to the microstates of the black hole that are relevant for the black entropy and eventually also for the solution of the black hole information puzzle.\nHence, the supertranslations $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$ provide a gravitational hair on the black hole horizon.\nNote that, as we will discuss, for infinite radius $r_S$ of the event horizon, the groups $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and  $BMS^-$ become identical to each other; in this limit we are\ndealing just with the BMS transformations of four-dimensional Minkowski space, since for $r_S\\rightarrow\\infty$ approaches the Minkowski metric (see the appendix of this paper).\n\n  In the second part of the paper, we shall address the question of quantum information counting that is encoded in states created by the transformations  $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$.  Classically, these transformations connect the different vacuum states of the black hole into each other and the corresponding classical Goldstone field is exactly gapless. Thus, classically the amount of entropy carried by these modes \n  is {\\it infinite}. This nicely matches the fact originating from the microscopic theory \\cite{Nportrait} that in classical theory \n  $N$ is infinite and so must be the amount of information carried by the black hole hair. \n However, as we shall argue,  in quantum theory the Goldstone field \n of $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$-transformation\n is no longer gapless and contains only a finite number of Bogoliubov modes that can contribute into the entropy.   We shall show that the number of the eligible modes scales as $N$ and thus gives the correct scaling of black hole entropy.  \n \n We thus provide a crucial missing link between the geometric description of the pure gravitational hair of a black hole and its quantum entropy.   \n This result is in full agreement with the idea  of \\cite{Dvali:2015rea} about the possible geometric interpretation of  Bogoliubov modes, but now we have an explicit candidate for it.  \n \n   Finally, we devote a section in explaining the crucial role of quantum criticality in obtaining the correct entropy counting, once we go from classical to quantum regimes.  We explain, why naively dividing the horizon area into Planck-size pixels does not work for understanding the black hole entropy, and why one needs an input from \n   quantum criticality  \\cite{gold,giamischa} for quantifying the amount of information carried by the black hole hair in the quantum world.   \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Supertranslations on event horizon of a Schwarzschild-black hole}\n\n\n\\subsection{The standard BMS transformations on null infinity}\n\nFirst let us review the classical BMS transformations \\cite{bms,strom} in more detail.\nAs usual, in this context  we perform a coordinate transformation to Bondi coordinates by introducing a retarded or advanced time $u$ and spherical coordinates $r,{\\vartheta},{\\varphi}$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nu&=&t\\mp r\\,, \\nonumber\\\\\nr\\, \\cos{\\vartheta}&=&  x_1  \\, , \\nonumber\\\\\nr\\, \\sin{\\vartheta} e^{i{\\varphi}}&=& x_3+ix_2\\, .\n\\end{eqnarray}\nInstead of  ${\\vartheta}$ and ${\\varphi}$ one can also use  complex coordinates $z,\\bar z$ on the (conformal) sphere $S^2$:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 4701, "prevtext": " \n  \n 2) The energy gap for exciting each mode scales as,  \n \n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n \\Delta E = {1 \\over N} {\\hbar \\over r_S};\n \\label{gap} \n \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta E={1\\over N}{\\hbar\\over r_{S}};\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>N</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u210f</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>S</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>;</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03725.tex", "nexttext": "\nIn this coordinate system, future or past\nnull infinity, denoted by ${\\mathscr I}^+$ or by ${\\mathscr I}^-$ respectively, are the two null surfaces at spatial infinity:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17966, "prevtext": "\n \n 3)  The gravitational coupling, evaluated for wave-length $r_S$,  is  $\\alpha = { 1\\over N}$.   \n \n 4) Deviations from thermal spectrum in Hawking radiation are \n of order ${1 \\over N}$.}\\footnote{This property can be proven in very general terms \\cite{nonthermal}.}\n \\\\\n        \n   Correspondingly, the hair-resolution time scales as \n   $t_{hair} \\sim N r_S$ and is of the order of the black hole half life time. \n   Notice that, both in classical as well as in semi-classical limits, we have  $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.

Furthermore, if one considers a gravitational scattering process\n(an S-matrix in Quantum\nField Theory) on asymptotically flat spaces, there is a non-trivial intertwining between $BMS^+$ and $BMS^-$ (see first reference in \\cite{asym}).\n\nHowever holography using black holes is independent of asymptotic boundaries but originates from considerations of the black hole horizon. \nThis suggests that a more general set up should be\npossible, extending the concept of symmetries also to the horizon of black hole.\nRecently it was conjectured \\cite{Strominger:2013jfa} (for other recent work on BMS symmetries, gravitational memory and the relation to soft theorems in scattering\namplitudes see \\cite{strom})\nthat the BMS symmetry will play an important role in resolving the so called black hole information paradox by providing an (infinite-dimensional) hair, i.e.\ncharges \nto the black hole, that carry the information about the collapsing matter before the black hole is formed. Moreover it was argued \\cite{Hawking:2015qqa} that the BMS group can can be extended\nas symmetry group  $BMS^{\\cal H}$ to the horizon ${\\cal H}$ of a Schwarzschild black hole. \nHowever the relation between $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and the standard BMS groups $BMS^\\pm$ is still rather unclear. Also what is the action of $BMS^{\\cal H}$ on the mass of the black hole\nwas so far not yet discussed.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper we will explicitly construct the supertranslations $BMS^{\\cal H}$ on the event horizon ${\\cal H}$ of a Schwarzschild black hole with metric written in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates\\footnote{For additional recent work on infinite (BMS-like) symmetries on black hole horizon see \\cite{bmshor}.} In addition there are still the  standard BMS transformation $BMS^-$ acting on the past null infinity surface ${\\mathscr I}^-$ of the black hole geometry. \nWorking out the relation between $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and  $BMS^-$,\nit is possible\nto entangle  the transformations $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and $BMS^-$ in  a non-trivial way. Namely we will show that the horizon supertranslations $BMS^{\\cal H}$ \ncontain a part that cannot be compensated by $BMS^-$ transformations. This part of supertranslations\non ${\\cal H}$, which can be \nformally denoted by $\\cal A \\equiv BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$, act only on the horizon of the black hole and take the form of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on the black hole event horizon ${\\cal H}$.\nWe will show that these $\\cal A$-supertranslations leave the ADM mass of the black hole invariant. Using this information we can explicitly construct the Bogoliubov/Goldstone-type \nmodes that correspond to the $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$ transformations on the Schwarzschild metric, and show in this way that these modes are classically gapless.\n\n\nAs we shall argue, the transformations $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$\nare those that give raise to the microstates of the black hole that are relevant for the black entropy and eventually also for the solution of the black hole information puzzle.\nHence, the supertranslations $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$ provide a gravitational hair on the black hole horizon.\nNote that, as we will discuss, for infinite radius $r_S$ of the event horizon, the groups $BMS^{\\cal H}$ and  $BMS^-$ become identical to each other; in this limit we are\ndealing just with the BMS transformations of four-dimensional Minkowski space, since for $r_S\\rightarrow\\infty$ approaches the Minkowski metric (see the appendix of this paper).\n\n  In the second part of the paper, we shall address the question of quantum information counting that is encoded in states created by the transformations  $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$.  Classically, these transformations connect the different vacuum states of the black hole into each other and the corresponding classical Goldstone field is exactly gapless. Thus, classically the amount of entropy carried by these modes \n  is {\\it infinite}. This nicely matches the fact originating from the microscopic theory \\cite{Nportrait} that in classical theory \n  $N$ is infinite and so must be the amount of information carried by the black hole hair. \n However, as we shall argue,  in quantum theory the Goldstone field \n of $BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$-transformation\n is no longer gapless and contains only a finite number of Bogoliubov modes that can contribute into the entropy.   We shall show that the number of the eligible modes scales as $N$ and thus gives the correct scaling of black hole entropy.  \n \n We thus provide a crucial missing link between the geometric description of the pure gravitational hair of a black hole and its quantum entropy.   \n This result is in full agreement with the idea  of \\cite{Dvali:2015rea} about the possible geometric interpretation of  Bogoliubov modes, but now we have an explicit candidate for it.  \n \n   Finally, we devote a section in explaining the crucial role of quantum criticality in obtaining the correct entropy counting, once we go from classical to quantum regimes.  We explain, why naively dividing the horizon area into Planck-size pixels does not work for understanding the black hole entropy, and why one needs an input from \n   quantum criticality  \\cite{gold,giamischa} for quantifying the amount of information carried by the black hole hair in the quantum world.   \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Supertranslations

In this note, we wish to identify the right supertranslation group, responsible \nfor black hole information and show that the corresponding Goldstone modes are indeed gapless and have the right properties to match the critical Bogoliubov\nmodes of quantum theory.   \n\n We show that existence of these classically-gapless modes is intrinsically linked with  the existence of the event horizon (and the associated supertranslation group). \n  We hence establish the mapping between the existence of the horizon in the classical description and an underlying quantum critical state, as it was explained in the introduction.    \n \n Although the reasoning is extendable to general horizons, for concreteness and simplicity, we shall consider the case of an eternal Schwarzschild black hole. \n\nConsider the Schwarzschild-metric in (infalling) Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates $(v,r,{\\vartheta},{\\varphi})$ given by the coordinate-transformation\n\n", "index": 19, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nv= t + r^* \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"v=t+r^{*}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03725.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis choice of Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates covers the exterior and the future-interior of a Schwarzschild black hole and the metric gets the form\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 25176, "prevtext": "\nwith \n\n", "index": 21, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ndr^* = (1-\\frac{r_S}{r})^{-1} dr \\,.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E11.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"dr^{*}=(1-\\frac{r_{S}}{r})^{-1}dr\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>S</mi></msub><mi>r</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>r</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03725.tex", "nexttext": " \n\nOn the event horizon $\\cal H$ with  $r=r_S$  we have a nullvector $n^\\mu=(1,0,0,0)$ with $g_{\\mu \\nu}n^{\\mu}n^{\\nu}=0.$ We define the group of supertranslations on the horizon ${\\cal H}$ by its Lie-Algebra  in analogy with the way the group of supertranslations is defined on null-infinity (see the definition in \\cite{Ashtekar:2014zsa}).

independent function $g=g({\\vartheta}, {\\varphi})$.\n\n\n \n Let us remark that taking the limit $r_S \\to \\infty$ we are not led to consider the standard BMS transformations on ${\\mathscr I}^+$. \n\n \n\nSo for the black hole metric, we are still considering two {\\it a priori} independent supertranslations, namely,\n$BMS^{\\cal H}$ on the horizon and $BMS^-$ on past null infinity ${\\mathscr I}^-$.\nHence instead of the standard supertranslations $BMS^+$ we are dealing in case of the black hole with  $BMS^{\\cal H}$, whereas the group $BMS^-$ still provides\nthe asymptotic symmetries of the black hole at ${\\mathscr I}^-$.\n In other words, the dynamics of black hole formation is  associated with the relation between the two BMS groups we are dealing with, namely $BMS^-$, describing the collapsing body before black hole formation,  and $BMS^{\\cal H}$ associated with the horizon of the black hole.\n \n\n\n\\section{Bogoliubov-modes as classical black hole hair}\n\nAssociated to the supertranslations \\eqref{Supertranslationen} we can calculate the Bogoliubov-modes $\\delta_\\zeta g_{\\mu \\nu}$. \nNote that any representative of an equivalence class in the Lie algebra of supertranslations, i.e., any vector field satisfying the boundary conditions \\eqref{RB}, \\eqref{Randbedingungen}, would give rise to solutions $\\delta_\\zeta g_{\\mu \\nu}$ of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. However, for an observer in a concrete coordinate system we have to specify the additional coordinate conditions (i.e. fix the gauge-freedom). Bogoliubov modes which do not fulfill the coordinate conditions (called ghosts) are not the observable excitations for an observer in this particular coordinate system.

We shall call these additional Bogoliubov-modes \\eqref{microstates} and \\eqref{quotient}, which are due to the group $\\cal A$, as $\\cal A$-modes. Since the BMS-Bogoliubov modes, i.e., the modes due to BMS-supertranslations at null infinity $\\mathscr I^-,$ are physical, they provide, already at the classical level, a hair to the black hole. In order to determine the point in phase space corresponding to the black hole state, the function $g$ in \\eqref{BMS-Bogoliubov} has to be specified. However, this BMS-degeneracy is present for all isolated systems. Therefore, it is not to expect that these BMS-Bogoliubov modes contribute to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. However, there are additional physical excitations due to the $\\cal A$-modes. It is highly expected that they contribute to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and should be identified with the black hole micro-states, as the presence of $\\cal A$ is intrinsically due to the presence of the event horizon. In the next section, we will show explicitly that the $\\cal A$-modes are classically-gapless, i.e., they do not change the value of the ADM-mass.\\footnote{That the BMS-Bogoliubov-modes are gapless is well-known and follows from the fact that \\eqref{BMS-Bogoliubov} \\newline\ndecays as $O(\\frac{1}{r})$ in cartesian-coordinates \\cite{Arnowitt:1962hi}.} The group $\\cal A$ provides additional hair to the back hole. One has to specify (independently of $g$) an additional function $f$ in \\eqref{microstates} in order to determine the exact position of the black hole state in phase space. Therefore, we have two degeneracies providing classical black hole hair, which consistently collapse to ordinary BMS-degeneracy in the limit $r_S \\to \\infty$ in which the group $\\cal A$ disappears. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Gaplessness of $\\cal A$-modes - Quantum Criticality}\n\nIn order to see that the Bogoliubov-excitations \\eqref{microstates} are gapless, we translate them via $t=v-r^*$ to Schwarzschild coordinates $(t,r,{\\vartheta},{\\varphi})$, which yields\n\\begin{eqnarray}\ng_{\\mu \\nu} + \\delta_{\\chi_f} g_{\\mu \\nu}\n={\\tiny \\begin{pmatrix}\n-(1-\\frac{r_S}{r}) & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & (1-\\frac{r_S}{r})^{-1} & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & r^2 -2r^2 \\frac{1}{r_S} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial {\\vartheta}^2} & -2r^2 \\frac{1}{r_S} (\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial {\\vartheta} \\partial {\\varphi}}-\\cot {\\vartheta} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial {\\varphi}})\\\\\n0 & 0 & * & r^2 \\sin^2 {\\vartheta} -2r^2 \\frac{1}{r_S} (\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial  {\\varphi}^2} + \\sin {\\vartheta} \\cos {\\vartheta} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial {\\vartheta}})\n\\end{pmatrix}}\n.\n\\label{microstates2}\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n\nNext we compute the ADM-mass (in units where $G_N=1$) via a version of the Brown-York formula due to Brewin \\cite{Brewin:2006qe}\n \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "  \n\n           \n\\subsection{Microstates of Schwarzschild black hole}\n\nComparing the Bogoliubov-excitations due to supertranslations on the event horizon \\eqref{Supertranslationen} with the excitations due to ordinary BMS-supertranslations \\eqref{BMS}, we see that the horizon supertranslations contain a part which cannot be compensated by standard BMS-supertranslations.

Since the BMS-Bogoliubov modes, i.e., the modes due to BMS-supertranslations at null infinity $\\mathscr I^-,$ are physical, they provide, already at the classical level, a hair to the black hole. In order to determine the point in phase space corresponding to the black hole state, the function $g$ in \\eqref{BMS-Bogoliubov} has to be specified. However, this BMS-degeneracy is present for all isolated systems. Therefore, it is not to expect that these BMS-Bogoliubov modes contribute to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. However, there are additional physical excitations due to the $\\cal A$-modes. It is highly expected that they contribute to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and should be identified with the black hole micro-states, as the presence of $\\cal A$ is intrinsically due to the presence of the event horizon. In the next section, we will show explicitly that the $\\cal A$-modes are classically-gapless, i.e., they do not change the value of the ADM-mass.\\footnote{That the BMS-Bogoliubov-modes are gapless is well-known and follows from the fact that \\eqref{BMS-Bogoliubov} \\newline\ndecays as $O(\\frac{1}{r})$ in cartesian-coordinates \\cite{Arnowitt:1962hi}.} The group $\\cal A$ provides additional hair to the back hole. One has to specify (independently of $g$) an additional function $f$ in \\eqref{microstates} in order to determine the exact position of the black hole state in phase space. Therefore, we have two degeneracies providing classical black hole hair, which consistently collapse to ordinary BMS-degeneracy in the limit $r_S \\to \\infty$ in which the group $\\cal A$ disappears. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Gaplessness of $\\cal A$-modes - Quantum Criticality}\n\nIn order to see that the Bogoliubov-excitations \\eqref{microstates} are gapless, we translate them via $t=v-r^*$ to Schwarzschild coordinates $(t,r,{\\vartheta},{\\varphi})$, which yields\n\\begin{eqnarray}\ng_{\\mu \\nu} + \\delta_{\\chi_f} g_{\\mu \\nu}\n={\\tiny \\begin{pmatrix}\n-(1-\\frac{r_S}{r}) & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & (1-\\frac{r_S}{r})^{-1} & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & r^2 -2r^2 \\frac{1}{r_S} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial {\\vartheta}^2} & -2r^2 \\frac{1}{r_S} (\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial {\\vartheta} \\partial {\\varphi}}-\\cot {\\vartheta} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial {\\varphi}})\\\\\n0 & 0 & * & r^2 \\sin^2 {\\vartheta} -2r^2 \\frac{1}{r_S} (\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial  {\\varphi}^2} + \\sin {\\vartheta} \\cos {\\vartheta} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial {\\vartheta}})\n\\end{pmatrix}}\n.\n\\label{microstates2}\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n\nNext we compute the ADM-mass (in units where $G_N=1$) via a version of the Brown-York formula due to Brewin \\cite{Brewin:2006qe}\n \n", "index": 45, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nM_{ADM} = \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\lim_{S \\to i^0} (\\frac{dA}{ds})_+ - (\\frac{dA}{ds})_-,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E28.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"M_{ADM}=\\frac{1}{8\\pi}\\lim_{S\\to i^{0}}(\\frac{dA}{ds})_{+}-(\\frac{dA}{ds})_{-},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>8</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo movablelimits=\"false\">lim</mo><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>\u2192</mo><msup><mi>i</mi><mn>0</mn></msup></mrow></munder><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03725.tex", "nexttext": "  \n Already from the form of $\\chi^\\mu$ it is clear that one can do a reparametrization in $({\\vartheta}, {\\varphi})$ such that one obtains the line element of an Euclidean $S^2.$ \n One has therefore\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\nwhere $S$ is the sphere $t=const., r=const.$ and $r$ is taken to infinity.

"nexttext": "\n\nTherefore, for every Bogoliubov-excitation \\eqref{microstates} given by a function $f=f({\\vartheta}, {\\varphi})$ the ADM-mass is equal to the Schwarzschild-mass and therefore these excitations are gapless. It might look strange that the Bogoliubov excitations look as angular reparametrizations. However, the important point is that precisely those angular reparametrizations which are of the form given by $\\chi^\\mu$ are the physical Bogoliubov excitations. Although,  arbitrary angular reparametrizations solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, they are in general unobservable. Indeed, they also solve the coordinate condition we have imposed. But, since in our coordinate conditions we have fixed a time-component of the metric, one of our coordinate conditions fixes only a Lagrange-parameter of the ADM-formulation of general relativity. This Lagrange-parameter restricts one of the other parameters, but does not help in getting rid of one degree of freedom. However, the argument can be repaired by using coordinate conditions which fix four degrees of freedom, in such a way  that the remaining gauge freedom is really due to physical excitation of the canonical variables. One then carries out the same argument (with more involved  equations), transforms back to our coordinate conditions and arrives  to the same result that precisely the Bogoliubov excitations given above correspond to the physical gapless excitations. The presence of the physical gapless angular reparametrizations is due to the presence of the black hole event horizon. \n\nThus, we have shown that the $\\cal A$-modes are gapless. The presence of these additional gapless excitations is a highly non-trivial phenomenon and \nis the classical sign of  the underlying quantum criticality of the Schwarzschild geometry. \n This phenomenon has several important consequences. In particular \n it is the key to the information storage capacity of the black hole and respectively   \nto the existence of black hole hair and entropy.  We shall quantify some of  these properties in the next section. \n \n  \n\n\n\\section{Information Resolution and Entropy Counting} \n\n  We have identified the black hole hair carried by the Bogoliubov excitation \\eqref{microstates} given by a function $f=f({\\vartheta}, {\\varphi})$. We have shown that for this \n form of excitations the ADM-mass is equal to the Schwarzschild-mass and therefore these excitations are classically-gapless.\n \n  We now need to understand how much information can be encoded in these excitations.  Notice, that up until now, our analysis was purely classical. \n  That is, we have been working with finite $M$ and $G_N$, but zero \n  $\\hbar$.  This is equivalent to saying that we were working with \n  $L_P = 0$ and thus, $N = \\infty$.   The results obtained in this limit pass the  first consistency check that we are on the right track of understanding the origin of black hole entropy, \n since as we saw, in this limit an {\\it arbitrary} \n  deformation of the form $f=f({\\vartheta}, {\\varphi})$ is exactly gapless.

Since $f$ is an arbitrary continuous function of spherical coordinates, we can encode an { \\it infinite}  amount of information in it at {\\it zero}  energy cost.  Indeed, in classical theory we can encode a message by giving different values to $f$ for set of coordinates, say, ${\\vartheta}_1,{\\varphi}_1$ and \n ${\\vartheta}_2,{\\varphi}_2$ that can be {\\it arbitrarily} close. This is because in classical theory the\n arbitrarily small coordinate differences  (i.e., $ \\Delta {\\vartheta} = {\\vartheta}_2 - {\\vartheta}-1, ~~\n \\Delta{\\varphi} = {\\varphi}_2-{\\varphi}_1$) are resolvable at zero energy cost.  \n This is why the ground-state of any classical system with a  gapless field $f({\\vartheta},{\\varphi})$  has infinite entropy, from the information point of view. \n\n In quantum theory, there is no longer a free lunch, because the coordinate-resolution costs finite energy. The amount of entropy carried by the same system, once $\\hbar$ is set to be non-zero,  crucially depends on the energy-cost of the coordinate-resolution.   \nThis is why, {\\it a priory} it is not obvious what shall remain out of the infinite classical entropy in the quantum world. \n\n   Without having a microscopic quantum theory that could tells us what is the\n   energy-cost of coordinate-resolution, we can only make some guesses.  \nFor example, we can take a naive root and put a Planck-scale resolution cutoff on the \ncoordinate-separation, demanding $r_S\\Delta {\\vartheta} > L_P, ~~r_S\\Delta {\\varphi} > L_P$. \nThat is, we decide to use in information-count only the values of the function $f$ in the set    \nof points that are separated by distance of Planck length or larger.  This way of entropy-counting is equivalent \nto dividing the are of the sphere in Planck-area pixels, each housing a single quantum degree of freedom (i.e., a qubit). Since the total number of pixels is \n$N = R^2/L_P^2$, it is obvious that the scaling of \nentropy obtained in this way shall match the Bekenstein entropy.   \n This is essentially the approach originally introduced by 't Hooft \\cite{thooft} and \n also adopted recently  in \\cite{Hawking:2016msc}.   \n \n  The problem, however, is that such a method, despite being an interesting\n prescription,  cannot be considered, without an additional microscopic input,  \n  to be an explanation of entropy scaling, because of the reason that we shall now explain. \n \n  In a generic quantum system, housing a degree of freedom (say a two-level quantum system) in a Planck-size pixel would cost the energy gap \n  $\\Delta E \\sim {\\hbar \\over L_P}$.

The information stored in these \n states is a manifestation of the black hole hair.  From the microscopic quantum theory the existence of such a hair was concluded some time ago \\cite{Nportrait, gold}, but \n its precise geometric description has not been found so far. \n \n In \\cite{Dvali:2015rea}, using the view of Minkowski space as of infinite-mass limit of a black hole, this symmetry was identified with BMS symmetry of Minkowski space.  Minkowski space was described as a coherent state with infinite occupation number of infinite-wavelength gravitons. The symmetry that  connects the inequivalent Minkowski vacua changes the occupation number of these soft   \ngravitons in the coherent state. These gravitons play the role of Goldstone bosons\nthat carry infinite entropy of Minkowski space.    \n\n \n   In this paper, we have suggested that the right candidate for such a  symmetry\n  for a finite-size black hole is the transformation corresponding to the quotient  $\\cal A \\equiv BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$. \n Geometrically, we have identified the supertranslations on the black hole horizon as being  area-preserving transformations on the two-sphere.  \n   We have performed various consistency checks showing that this symmetry indeed passes all the tests for describing the geometric limit of an underlying quantum critical degeneracy of black hole micro-states. \n   \n   In particular, we showed that the variations of the black hole metric, $\\delta_{\\chi} g_{\\mu \\nu}$, induced by $\\cal A$, are classically gapless, as they do not change \n   the ADM mass of the metric.  Classically, these gapless excitations can be interpreted as the Goldstone field (parameterized by an arbitrary function $f({\\vartheta},{\\varphi})$) that connects the degenerate black hole ground-states. In the quantum language, these excitations correspond to the Bogoliubov excitations that give rise to the black hole micro-states. \n   In short, we have identified some clear hints for the quantum criticality of the Schwarzschild-geometry.\n   \n    In the classical limit, the hair and the entropy carried by these gapless modes is infinite and information cannot be resolved during any finite time. \n     Thus, for the information-recovery the quantum effects are crucial.  \n       \n  We have then showed, confirming the suggestion of the previous work \\cite{Dvali:2015rea},  that in quantum theory, the gap is necessarily generated due to ${1 \\over N}$-effects.  Simultaneously, the number of independent modes that contribute into the entropy counting becomes finite and scales as $N$.  This matches the black hole entropy scaling.    \n   \nWe have argued that\nin gravity boundary null-surfaces are equipped with data that qualify as classical ground-states. In quantum picture these ground-states can be described as  coherent states composed out of soft background modes and are related by the action of the asymptotic symmetry groups. \nOnce the non-zero interaction among the background quanta is taken into the account, the degeneracy is expected to be lifted and the majority of the ground-states becomes unstable.  This will manifest in radiation coming from the null boundary in a perfectly unitary form.\n  Of course, as argued in \\cite{Dvali:2015rea}, this effect is absent for Minkowski space, since the constituent quanta have infinite wave-lengths, and correspondingly,  they have vanishing quantum gravitational coupling. \\\\\n  \n   \n   Finally, let us make a comment that should help the reader to catch the essence of \n   the transformation $\\cal A$ and the key difference of our result \n   from the recent analysis in \\cite{Hawking:2016msc}.  \n   For this note that the analog of $\\cal A$ in case of $U(1)$-gauge theory would be trivial. In this case one can easily observe that any large gauge transformation on $\\cal H$ can be compensated by the corresponding one on $\\mathscr I^-$, leading to a trivial $\\cal A$, i.e.,  equal to the identity. The obvious reason for this is that in the gauge case, contrary to what we have shown is happening in the case of gravity, the large gauge transformations have no explicit dependence on the geometrical data defining the horizon. In other words, in the gauge case the Goldstone bosons associated with large gauge transformations are always $S$-matrix soft photons and the only possibility to use them as some form of horizon hair is by implementing (or implanting in the sense of \\cite{Hawking:2016msc}) soft photons on the horizon. This is due to the fact that for the case of electro-magnetic large gauge transformation $\\cal A$ is trivial.  \n   \nFor gravity and its BMS transformations the situation is dramatically different in two important senses. First, the quotient between the transformations on $\\mathscr I^-$ and $\\cal H$ is already non-trivial on the basis of the geometry and secondly this quotient defines physical transformations. Note again the important difference with the gauge case where, if we use two different  gauge shift functions  (denoted in \\cite{Hawking:2016msc} by \n$\\epsilon$) on $\\cal H$ and $\\mathscr I^-$, the difference becomes a {\\it gauge redundancy}. \n\nAs we have lengthly discussed along the paper, the non-triviality of $\\cal A$ in the case of gravity is what allows us to identify the purely-gravitational candidates to account for the black hole entropy, or equivalently, the purely-gravitational hair. A hair that is soft, but relative not to a notion of $S$-matrix softness, but to the intrinsic notion of softness (existence of gapless modes) determined by the black hole criticality.  In this sense, the $\\cal A$-Goldstones  (generated by the  vector $\\chi_{\\mu}$) can be viewed as the St\\\"uckelberg fields \\cite{stuckelberg}  that manifest physicality of this transformation. \nNote that in the case of charged black holes the explicit dependence of $\\cal A$ on the charge (or charges) of the black hole appears through the geometric dependence of $\\cal A$ on the gravitational radius.\n\nA potentially-important general lesson we can extract from our findings is that what characterizes the ability of a null-surface $\\cal H$ to work as holographic screen, is the ``rank'' of the corresponding $\\cal A(\\cal H)$. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank Ioannis Bakas and Alexander Gu\\ss mann for many discussions.

First of all, the UV/IR non-Wilsonian structure of gravity leads us to a gravitational dressing by $N$ soft quanta. The suppression factor is however compensated by the difference between the asymptotic group $BMS^-$ and the  $BMS^{\\cal H}$. From the microscopic point of view defined by the $N$-portrait this {\\it enhancement} of asymptotic symmetries simply reflects the quantum criticality of the many body graviton system.\n\nOf course, the previous discussion simply intends to grasp the underlying structure. The key point is how the integral over $\\cal A$ precisely compensates the suppression factor $e^{-N}$, or in other words, how do we get the right black hole entropy.  This was explained above, by showing that at finite-$N$  the number of relevant Bogoliubov modes contributing into the entropy scales precisely as $N$. This fact shall ensure that \nfor finite $N$ the integral over  $\\cal A$ gets reduced to a discrete sum over \n$\\sim 2^N$  final micro-states.  This provides the needed compensation for the suppression factor $e^{-N}$. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\n The goal of this paper was to explicitly identify a candidate symmetry that in the geometric description can account for the existence of the degenerated black hole (micro)states, which give rise to  black hole entropy.  The information stored in these \n states is a manifestation of the black hole hair.  From the microscopic quantum theory the existence of such a hair was concluded some time ago \\cite{Nportrait, gold}, but \n its precise geometric description has not been found so far. \n \n In \\cite{Dvali:2015rea}, using the view of Minkowski space as of infinite-mass limit of a black hole, this symmetry was identified with BMS symmetry of Minkowski space.  Minkowski space was described as a coherent state with infinite occupation number of infinite-wavelength gravitons. The symmetry that  connects the inequivalent Minkowski vacua changes the occupation number of these soft   \ngravitons in the coherent state. These gravitons play the role of Goldstone bosons\nthat carry infinite entropy of Minkowski space.    \n\n \n   In this paper, we have suggested that the right candidate for such a  symmetry\n  for a finite-size black hole is the transformation corresponding to the quotient  $\\cal A \\equiv BMS^{\\cal H}/BMS^-$. \n Geometrically, we have identified the supertranslations on the black hole horizon as being  area-preserving transformations on the two-sphere.  \n   We have performed various consistency checks showing that this symmetry indeed passes all the tests for describing the geometric limit of an underlying quantum critical degeneracy of black hole micro-states. \n   \n   In particular, we showed that the variations of the black hole metric, $\\delta_{\\chi} g_{\\mu \\nu}$, induced by $\\cal A$, are classically gapless, as they do not change \n   the ADM mass of the metric.  Classically, these gapless excitations can be interpreted as the Goldstone field (parameterized by an arbitrary function $f({\\vartheta},{\\varphi})$) that connects the degenerate black hole ground-states. In the quantum language, these excitations correspond to the Bogoliubov excitations that give rise to the black hole micro-states. \n   In short, we have identified some clear hints for the quantum criticality of the Schwarzschild-geometry.\n   \n    In the classical limit, the hair and the entropy carried by these gapless modes is infinite and information cannot be resolved during any finite time. \n     Thus, for the information-recovery the quantum effects are crucial.  \n       \n  We have then showed, confirming the suggestion of the previous work \\cite{Dvali:2015rea},  that in quantum theory, the gap is necessarily generated due to ${1 \\over N}$-effects.  Simultaneously, the number of independent modes that contribute into the entropy counting becomes finite and scales as $N$.  This matches the black hole entropy scaling.    \n   \nWe have argued that\nin gravity boundary null-surfaces are equipped with data that qualify as classical ground-states. In quantum picture these ground-states can be described as  coherent states composed out of soft background modes and are related by the action of the asymptotic symmetry groups. \nOnce the non-zero interaction among the background quanta is taken into the account, the degeneracy is expected to be lifted and the majority of the ground-states becomes unstable.  This will manifest in radiation coming from the null boundary in a perfectly unitary form.\n  Of course, as argued in \\cite{Dvali:2015rea}, this effect is absent for Minkowski space, since the constituent quanta have infinite wave-lengths, and correspondingly,  they have vanishing quantum gravitational coupling. \\\\\n  \n   \n   Finally, let us make a comment that should help the reader to catch the essence of \n   the transformation $\\cal A$ and the key difference of our result \n   from the recent analysis in \\cite{Hawking:2016msc}.  \n   For this note that the analog of $\\cal A$ in case of $U(1)$-gauge theory would be trivial. In this case one can easily observe that any large gauge transformation on $\\cal H$ can be compensated by the corresponding one on $\\mathscr I^-$, leading to a trivial $\\cal A$, i.e.,  equal to the identity. The obvious reason for this is that in the gauge case, contrary to what we have shown is happening in the case of gravity, the large gauge transformations have no explicit dependence on the geometrical data defining the horizon. In other words, in the gauge case the Goldstone bosons associated with large gauge transformations are always $S$-matrix soft photons and the only possibility to use them as some form of horizon hair is by implementing (or implanting in the sense of \\cite{Hawking:2016msc}) soft photons on the horizon. This is due to the fact that for the case of electro-magnetic large gauge transformation $\\cal A$ is trivial.  \n   \nFor gravity and its BMS transformations the situation is dramatically different in two important senses. First, the quotient between the transformations on $\\mathscr I^-$ and $\\cal H$ is already non-trivial on the basis of the geometry and secondly this quotient defines physical transformations. Note again the important difference with the gauge case where, if we use two different  gauge shift functions  (denoted in \\cite{Hawking:2016msc} by \n$\\epsilon$) on $\\cal H$ and $\\mathscr I^-$, the difference becomes a {\\it gauge redundancy}. \n\nAs we have lengthly discussed along the paper, the non-triviality of $\\cal A$ in the case of gravity is what allows us to identify the purely-gravitational candidates to account for the black hole entropy, or equivalently, the purely-gravitational hair. A hair that is soft, but relative not to a notion of $S$-matrix softness, but to the intrinsic notion of softness (existence of gapless modes) determined by the black hole criticality.  In this sense, the $\\cal A$-Goldstones  (generated by the  vector $\\chi_{\\mu}$) can be viewed as the St\\\"uckelberg fields \\cite{stuckelberg}  that manifest physicality of this transformation. \nNote that in the case of charged black holes the explicit dependence of $\\cal A$ on the charge (or charges) of the black hole appears through the geometric dependence of $\\cal A$ on the gravitational radius.\n\nA potentially-important general lesson we can extract from our findings is that what characterizes the ability of a null-surface $\\cal H$ to work as holographic screen, is the ``rank'' of the corresponding $\\cal A(\\cal H)$. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank Ioannis Bakas and Alexander Gu\\ss mann for many discussions.

This conformal theory should be closely related to the bound states of the $N$-gravitons at the quantum critical point, which is also expected to be described by sort of a  conformal theory of gapless modes.\n\t\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\n\\bibitem{Hawking} \n S.~W.~Hawking,\n  ``Black hole explosions,''\n  Nature {\\bf 248} (1974) 30.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n S.~W.~Hawking,\n  ``Particle Creation by Black Holes,''\n  Commun.\\ Math.\\ Phys.\\  {\\bf 43} (1975) 199\n   [Commun.\\ Math.\\ Phys.\\  {\\bf 46} (1976) 206].\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\\bibitem{Nportrait}\n  G.~Dvali and C.~Gomez,\n  ``Black Hole's Quantum N-Portrait,''\n  Fortsch.\\ Phys.\\  {\\bf 61} (2013) 742\n  [arXiv:1112.3359 [hep-th]];  \n  ``Black Hole's 1/N Hair,''\n  Phys.\\ Lett.\\ B {\\bf 719} (2013) 419\n    [arXiv:1203.6575 [hep-th]].\n     ``Quantum Compositeness of Gravity: Black Holes, AdS and Inflation,''\n  JCAP {\\bf 1401} (2014) 023\n  [arXiv:1312.4795 [hep-th]]; \n  ``Black Hole Macro-Quantumness,''\n  arXiv:1212.0765 [hep-th]\n  \n  \n   G.~Dvali, C.~Gomez and D.~L\\\"ust,\n  ``Black Hole Quantum Mechanics in the Presence of Species,''\n  Fortsch.\\ Phys.\\  {\\bf 61} (2013) 768\n    [arXiv:1206.2365 [hep-th]].\n    \n    F.~K\\\"uhnel, M.~Sandstad, ``Baryon number conservation in Bose-Einstein condensate black holes\",  arXiv:1506.08823 [gr-qc]. \n  \n   \n    \\bibitem{gold}\n  G.~Dvali and C.~Gomez,\n  ``Black Holes as Critical Point of Quantum Phase Transition,''\n  Eur.\\ Phys.\\ J.\\ C {\\bf 74}, 2752 (2014)\n    [arXiv:1207.4059 [hep-th]]; \n    \n    \n    \\bibitem{Bent}\n  J.~D.~Bekenstein,\n  ``Black holes and entropy,''\n  Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 7}, 2333 (1973).\n  \n  \\bibitem{giamischa} \n\tSee last reference in \\cite{gold} \n\n\n  \n  \nD.~Flassig, A.~Pritzel and N.~Wintergerst,\n``Black Holes and Quantumness on Macroscopic Scales,''\n  Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 87}, 084007 (2013)\n  [arXiv:1212.3344].\n  \n  \nG.~Dvali, D.~Flassig, C.~Gomez, A.~Pritzel and N.~Wintergerst,\n``Scrambling in the Black Hole Portrait,''\n  Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 88}, no. 12, 124041 (2013)\n  [arXiv:1307.3458 [hep-th]].\n\n  \n\n  G.~Dvali, A.~Franca, C.~Gomez and N.~Wintergerst,\n  ``Nambu-Goldstone Effective Theory of Information at Quantum Criticality,''\n  Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 92} (2015) 12,  125002, [arXiv:1507.02948 [hep-th]].\n \t\nG.~Dvali,  M.~ Panchenko, ``Black Hole Type Quantum Computing in Critical Bose-Einstein Systems'', arXiv:1507.08952 [hep-th];  ``Black Hole Based Quantum Computing in Labs and in the Sky'', arXiv:1601.01329 [hep-th].\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\\bibitem{nonthermal}\t\nG.~Dvali, ``Non-Thermal Corrections to Hawking Radiation Versus the Information Paradox'',  arXiv:1509.04645 [hep-th].\n\n\n\n\\bibitem{Dvali:2015rea}\n  G.~Dvali, C.~Gomez and D.~L\\\"ust,\n  ``Classical Limit of Black Hole Quantum N-Portrait and BMS Symmetry,''\n  doi:10.1016/j.physletb.2015.11.073\n  arXiv:1509.02114 [hep-th].\n\n\n\n\n      \\bibitem{bms} H.
