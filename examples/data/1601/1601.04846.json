The continuous background is due to inelastic\nexchange scattering of Bogoliubov quasiparticles off the impurity and\nit is thermally activated since it requires a finite thermal\npopulation of quasiparticles above the gap. In the singlet regime for\nstrong hybridization (charge-fluctuation regime) we detect the\npresence of an additional sub-gap structure just below the gap edges\nwith thermally activated behavior, but with an activation energy equal\nto the Shiba state excitation energy. These peaks can be tentatively\ninterpreted as Shiba bound states arising from the scattering of\nquasiparticles off the thermally excited sub-gap doublet Shiba states,\ni.e., as high-order Shiba states.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{72.15.Qm, 75.20.Hr}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nA magnetic impurity in a superconducting host induces localized bound\nstates inside the spectral gap, known in different communities as\neither Shiba, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov, or Andreev bound states\n\\cite{shiba1968,shiba1973,satori1992,balatsky2006,yazdani1997,Deacon:2010jn,pillet2010,franke2011,rodero2011}.\nAt zero temperature, Shiba states manifest as pairs of $\\delta$-peak\nresonances in the impurity spectral function $A(\\omega)$ positioned\nsymmetrically at positive and negative frequency corresponding to the\ntransitions from the many-particle ground state to the {\\sl same}\nmany-particle excited state by either adding a probing electron to the\nsystem $(\\omega>0)$ or removing it $(\\omega<0)$. The intrinsic\ntemperature dependence of the spectral function depends on the\nimpurity dynamics. When the impurity behaves as a classical object,\ni.e., a local magnetic field which is perfectly {\\sl static} on the\ntime-scale of the experiment (``adiabatic limit'' with no dynamics of\nthe internal degrees of freedom of the impurity), the corresponding\n{\\sl classical} impurity model is a quadratic non-interacting\nHamiltonian, hence the spectral function is not temperature dependent\nat all. This problem can be discussed in terms of single-particle\nlevels and their occupancy. When the impurity behaves, however, as a\nquantum object, i.e., a {\\sl fluctuating} local moment as described by\nthe Kondo or Anderson {\\sl quantum} impurity models, there will be\nnon-trivial intrinsic temperature dependence due to electron-electron\ninteractions (inelastic exchange scattering of thermally excited\nBogoliubov quasiparticles off the impurity spin). This problem is\nbetter addressed from the perspective of many-particle eigenstates.\nSince the eigenvalue spectrum of the Hamiltonian operator includes\nboth discrete Shiba states below the gap and a continuum part above\nthe gap, it is expected that there will be both $\\delta$-peaks and a\ncontinuous background coexisting inside the gap at any finite\ntemperature, providing a further realisation of the ``bound state in\nthe continuum'' paradigm.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the Andreev spectra was studied\nexperimentally in carbon nanotube quantum dots \\cite{Kumar:2014cq}.\nStrong temperature effects found in the measured differential\nconductance could be accounted for reasonably well using the tunneling\nformalism, however the intrinsic temperature dependence of the\nimpurity spectral function was not discussed. Another experimental\nrealization of impurity models are magnetic adatoms on superconducting\nsurfaces. In Ref.~\\onlinecite{ruby2015} the measured differential\nconductance was discussed in terms of a phenomenological impurity\nmodel based on a classical impurity. There is, however, a lack of\ntheoretical works on the temperature dependence of spectra of quantum\nimpurity models to provide an alternative framework from the\ninterpretation of measured spectra.\n\nIn this work we study the sub-gap spectral features in the\nsingle-impurity Anderson model with a superconducting bath described\nby the $s$-wave BCS mean-field Hamiltonian. After introducing the\nmodel and methods in Sec.~\\ref{sec2}, we first consider the model by\nfixing the gap parameter $\\Delta$ to its zero-temperature value and\nincreasing the temperature $T$ in Sec.~\\ref{sec3}. This simplified\ncalculation uncovers how the spectral weight is transferred from the\nShiba $\\delta$-peak to the continuum. In this section we also study\nthe hybridization dependence and the differences between the singlet\n(screened impurity) and doublet (unscreened impurity) regimes. In\nSec.~\\ref{sec4} we perform a full calculation with the temperature\ndependent gap of a BCS superconductor; in this case the Shiba peak\nbroadening is accompanied by peak shifts. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of the experimental relevance of the results.\n\n\n\\section{Model and method}\n\\label{sec2}\n\n\n\nWe consider the Hamiltonian $H = H_\\mathrm{BCS} + H_\\mathrm{imp} +\nH_\\mathrm{c}$:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\nH_\\mathrm{BCS} &= \\sum_{k\\sigma} \\epsilon_k c^\\dag_{k\\sigma} c_{k\\sigma}\n- \\Delta \\sum_k \\left( c^\\dag_{k\\uparrow} c^\\dag_{k\\downarrow} + \\text{H.c.}\n\\right), \\\\\nH_\\mathrm{imp} &= \\epsilon_d \\sum_\\sigma n_\\sigma + U n_\\uparrow\nn_\\downarrow, \\\\\nH_\\mathrm{c} &= \\sum_{k\\sigma} V_k \\left( c^\\dag_{k\\sigma} d_\\sigma +\n\\text{H.c.} \\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\split H_{\\mathrm{BCS}}&amp;=\\sum_{k\\sigma}\\epsilon_{k}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}c_{k%&#10;\\sigma}-\\Delta\\sum_{k}\\left(c^{\\dagger}_{k\\uparrow}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\downarrow}+%&#10;\\text{H.c.}\\right),\\\\&#10;H_{\\mathrm{imp}}&amp;=\\epsilon_{d}\\sum_{\\sigma}n_{\\sigma}+Un_{\\uparrow}n_{%&#10;\\downarrow},\\\\&#10;H_{\\mathrm{c}}&amp;=\\sum_{k\\sigma}V_{k}\\left(c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}d_{\\sigma}+\\text%&#10;{H.c.}\\right).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>{split}</mtext></merror><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>BCS</mi></msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;</mi><mo>=</mo><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></munder><msub><mi>\u03f5</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><msubsup><mi>c</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow><mo>\u2020</mo></msubsup><msub><mi>c</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>k</mi></munder><mrow><mo>(</mo><msubsup><mi>c</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2191</mo><mi/></mrow><mo>\u2020</mo></msubsup><msubsup><mi>c</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2193</mo><mi/></mrow><mo>\u2020</mo></msubsup><mo>+</mo><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\text</mtext></merror><mi>H</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>.</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>imp</mi></msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>\u03f5</mi><mi>d</mi></msub><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></munder><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>\u03c3</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>U</mi><msub><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2191</mo></msub><msub><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2193</mo></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi></msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;</mi><mo>=</mo><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></munder><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><msubsup><mi>c</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow><mo>\u2020</mo></msubsup><msub><mi>d</mi><mi>\u03c3</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\text</mtext></merror><mi>H</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>.</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04846.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig1.pdf}\n\n\\caption{(Color online) Schematic diagram of the many-particle\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian, partitioned into the even and odd\nfermion-parity sectors (i.e., parity of the total electron number).\nThis diagram corresponds to the case where the ground state has odd\nparity (spin-doublet). $D_o$ and $D_e$ are the odd-parity\n(spin-doublet) ${| {D} \\rangle}$ and the even-parity (spin-singlet) ${| {S} \\rangle}$\ndiscrete eigenstates.

Varying $\\Lambda$, Wilson chain\nlength, the discretization scheme, the algorithm for computing the\nspectral function (naive Lehmann-decomposition approach,\ncomplete-Fock-space, full-density-matrix), and the number of states\nkept in the truncation, it was found that this feature persists. It is\nthus either a generic artifact of the method for finite $T$ and\n$\\Delta$ that cannot be eliminated by any parameter choice, or a\nreal spectral feature of the Anderson impurity model with\nsuperconducting baths. Presently, there is no other theoretical method\nto reliably confirm the presence of this peak. However, the spectral\nweight appears sufficiently large that it could be detected\nexperimentally, despite its vicinity to the gap edge.\n\nIt should be emphasized that there are no discrete sub-gap\nmulti-particle states with the energy corresponding to this peak.\nInstead, its origin is associated with quasiparticle scattering on the\n{\\sl thermally} excited doublet Shiba state ${| {D} \\rangle}$ (for large\n$\\Gamma$, the ground state is namely ${| {S} \\rangle}$), generating new bound\nstates of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. In fact, it can be argued that\nthe physical mechanism is essentially the same as for the conventional\nShiba states: by thermal occupation of the doublet excited states at\nfinite temperatures the impurity partially ``remagnetizes'', and its\nmagnetic moment couples to the superconducting bath via an effective\nexchange coupling constant proportional to $J_K w_D$, where $J_K\n\\propto \\Gamma/U$ and $w_D = e^{-\\epsilon/T}/Z(T)$ is the average\npopulation in the doublet state. This generates a bound state located\njust below the gap edge because the effective coupling is weak. This\npicture is certainly oversimplified and fails to explain, for example,\nthe relatively constant position of the peak as a function of\ntemperature. Nevertheless, it is interesting that such ``high-order\nShiba states'' can be generated at finite temperatures.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig10.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig11.pdf}\n\n\\caption{(Color online) Weight and position of the ``high-order\nShiba peak'' below the gap edge.}\n\n\\label{ww}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig.~\\ref{ww} shows the $\\Gamma$-dependence of the weight and position\nof the additional peak.

The temperature dependence of key quantities is shown in\nFig.~\\ref{k}. The reduction of $\\Delta$ with increasing $T$ drives the\nsystem toward the singlet regime. The doublet-singlet transition\noccurs, however, just before the critical point (indicated by the\narrow in the figure). Although occurring at a finite temperature, such\nfirst-order boundary transition corresponds to a change of the ground\nstate of the impurity+bath system by the variation of an ``external''\nparameter, thus it may still be considered as a quantum phase\ntransition of the impurity subsystem (formed by the impurity itself\nand the subset of host states which hybridize with the impurity), even\nthough it is actually driven by thermal fluctuations in the\nsuperconducting host which drive down the gap function $\\Delta(T)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec5}\n\nBased on general considerations of an interacting impurity system, and\nconfirmed by numerical calculations, Shiba states at finite\ntemperature lose spectral weight to a continuous sub-gap background\ncentered at the same position. This immediately leads to a question of\nprinciple about the proper definition of the intrinsic lifetime of a\nShiba state. A discrete excited many-particle state isolated from the\ncontinuum could be expected to not decay at all. This is clearly the\ncase in the absence of quasiparticles. In an open system at finite\ntemperature, i.e., in contact with a heat and particle reservoar, a\nquasiparticle in the superconductor can be generated through a thermal\nfluctuation and can interact with the impurity spin, giving rise to a\ncontinuum background. The excited Shiba state can release its\nexcitation energy to the quasiparticle and decay to the Shiba ground\nstate, resulting in a finite lifetime. \n\nThe model system studied here is admittedly simplistic. In relastic\nsystems, in particular when there are tunneling path-ways to a normal\nmetal (such as a normal-state tip of a scanning tunneling microscope),\nthe $\\delta$-peak will strictly speaking no longer exist. Similarly,\n(direct or indirect) coupling to the acoustic phonons of the host will\nbroaden the $\\delta$-peak. If such couplings are small, however, it\nmay still be expected that the impurity spectral function will be\nmultimodal with non-trivial temperature dependence.\n\nLet us now consider the example of Mn adatoms on Pb(111) studied in\nRef.~\\onlinecite{ruby2015}. Pb has $T_c=\\unit[7.2]{K}$ or $\\Delta_0\n\\approx \\unit[1.1]{meV}$. The experimental temperatures were\n$\\unit[1.2]{K}$ and $\\unit[4.8]{K}$. Taking into account the reduction\nof $\\Delta$ in the BCS theory, these correspond to $k_B T/\\Delta$ of\n$0.12$ and $0.41$, respectively. The lower temperature is thus in the\nlow-$T$ limit, while at the second one the finite-temperature effects\nare expected to be sizable. In experiments, at the lower temperature\nthe measured linewidth was resolution limited and had to be estimated\nindirectly through current saturation plateaus. At the higher\ntemperature, the width could be extracted from the peak width in the\nweak-coupling regime, giving $\\Gamma \\approx \\unit[0.2]{meV}$. Thus\n$\\Gamma/\\Delta_0 \\approx 0.2$. Even without discussing how to properly\nquantify the intrinsic lifetime in NRG calculations (lower bound is\nthe HWHM of the continuum peak, $\\sim 0.01\\Delta$, upper bound is the\nstandard deviation of the continuum, $\\sim 0.1\\Delta$), it is possible\nto conclude that the order of magnitude is roughly correct. It should\nbe noted that there are further relaxation mechanisms (such as\nfermion-parity-conservig transitions assisted by phonons and photons)\nnot included in our model, which are likely to be comparable to the\n``intrinsic'' broadening due to electron-electron interactions, but\nthe intrinsic mechanism is certainly not negligible.\n\nThis work opens up a number of interesting issues for further study.\nOne could study how the intrinsic temperature dependence of the\nspectral function is reflected in the transport properties. This is\nrelevant for scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies of single\nimpurities and adaton chains, such as those expected to host Majorana\nend modes. Another question is how the results are modified if the BCS\nmean-field Hamiltonian is replaced by a proper interacting model with\nelectron-electron attraction terms. Finally, we need better\ntheoretical understanding of the ``high-order Shiba states'' and their\nrelation to the charge fluctuations.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nI acknowledge discussions with Toma\\v{z} Rejec and Jernej Mravlje,\nand the support of the\nSlovenian Research Agency (ARRS) under Program No. P1-0044.\n\\end{acknowledgments}\n\n\n\n\\bibliography{paper}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 34731, "prevtext": "\n\nwhere $\\epsilon=0.637\\Delta$ for the chosen value $\\Gamma/U=0.3$. This\npeak dominates the continuum background for small $T$, because its\nactivation energy $\\epsilon$ is lower than that ($\\Delta$) of the\ncontinuous background centered around the Shiba peak. The dominance of\nthe extra peak in the $T\\to0$ limit explains the strikingly peculiar\nlow-$T$ behavior of $\\omega_c(T)$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig4a}. Extensive\ntesting has been performed to assess if this feature could merely be a\nnumerical artifact of the NRG method. Varying $\\Lambda$, Wilson chain\nlength, the discretization scheme, the algorithm for computing the\nspectral function (naive Lehmann-decomposition approach,\ncomplete-Fock-space, full-density-matrix), and the number of states\nkept in the truncation, it was found that this feature persists. It is\nthus either a generic artifact of the method for finite $T$ and\n$\\Delta$ that cannot be eliminated by any parameter choice, or a\nreal spectral feature of the Anderson impurity model with\nsuperconducting baths. Presently, there is no other theoretical method\nto reliably confirm the presence of this peak. However, the spectral\nweight appears sufficiently large that it could be detected\nexperimentally, despite its vicinity to the gap edge.\n\nIt should be emphasized that there are no discrete sub-gap\nmulti-particle states with the energy corresponding to this peak.\nInstead, its origin is associated with quasiparticle scattering on the\n{\\sl thermally} excited doublet Shiba state ${| {D} \\rangle}$ (for large\n$\\Gamma$, the ground state is namely ${| {S} \\rangle}$), generating new bound\nstates of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. In fact, it can be argued that\nthe physical mechanism is essentially the same as for the conventional\nShiba states: by thermal occupation of the doublet excited states at\nfinite temperatures the impurity partially ``remagnetizes'', and its\nmagnetic moment couples to the superconducting bath via an effective\nexchange coupling constant proportional to $J_K w_D$, where $J_K\n\\propto \\Gamma/U$ and $w_D = e^{-\\epsilon/T}/Z(T)$ is the average\npopulation in the doublet state. This generates a bound state located\njust below the gap edge because the effective coupling is weak. This\npicture is certainly oversimplified and fails to explain, for example,\nthe relatively constant position of the peak as a function of\ntemperature. Nevertheless, it is interesting that such ``high-order\nShiba states'' can be generated at finite temperatures.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig10.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig11.pdf}\n\n\\caption{(Color online) Weight and position of the ``high-order\nShiba peak'' below the gap edge.}\n\n\\label{ww}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig.~\\ref{ww} shows the $\\Gamma$-dependence of the weight and position\nof the additional peak. The threshold for the existence of the peak\nis related to $\\Gamma^*$, thus the peak is intimately related to\nentering the charge-fluctuation regime. Close to the threshold, its\n$T=0$ position is at the gap-edge, while for larger $\\Gamma$ it starts\nat a finite binding energy below the edge. \n\n\n\\section{Results: BCS $\\Delta(T)$}\n\\label{sec4}\n\nWe now consider a realistic case where the gap $\\Delta$ is temperature\ndependent and tends to zero as the critical temperature $T_c$ is\napproached.
