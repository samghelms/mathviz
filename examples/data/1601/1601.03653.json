It is the random counting measure with atoms at\nthe points of the foil of the origin. \nThe distribution of the point foil \nunder the Palm probability of the point process\nis left invariant by all bijective shifts preserving the foliation.\nA point foil is not always {\\em markable}, i.e., is not always\na stationary point process under its Palm distribution. \n\nThe main mathematical result of the paper is the classification \nof point-shifts based on the cardinalities of their foils and\nconnected components (Theorem \\ref{cardinality.components})\nand on whether their point foils are markable or not.\n\nThe literature on point-shifts\nstarts with the seminal paper by\nJ. Mecke \\cite{Me75}. The fundamental result of \\cite{Me75} is\nthe {\\em point stationarity theorem}, which states that all bijective\npoint-shifts preserve the Palm distribution of all simple and\nstationary point processes.\nThe notion of {\\em point-map} was introduced by\nH. Thorisson (see \\cite{Th00} and the references therein) and\nfurther studied by M. Heveling and G. Last \\cite{HeLa05}.\nThe dynamical system analysis of point-shifts which is pursued \nin the present paper was proposed in \\cite{BaHaM}.   \nThe last paper is focused on long term properties of iterates of\npoint-shifts. It introduces the notion of {\\em point-map probability},\nwhich provides an extension of Mecke's point stationarity theorem.\nIn contrast, the present paper is focused on the stable manifold\nof a point-shift, as already mentioned.\nIt is centered on the definition of this object and \non the study of\nboth qualitative and quantitative properties of its distribution.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. \nSection \\ref{sec:difo} defines the setting for discrete foliations\nand Section \\ref{sec:ppps} that for point processes and point-shifts.\nSection \\ref{sec:psfo} combines the two frameworks and defines\nthe discrete foliation of a point process by a point-shift.\nSection \\ref{sec:cacl} gives the classification.\nSection \\ref{sec:pppm}\nintroduces the stable group of this foliation, and shows\nthe existence of measure preserving dynamics on the foliation. It also \ndefines the foil point process.\nFinally, Section \\ref{sec:quant} gathers the quantitative\nproperties of foliations.\n\n\n\\section{Discrete Foliations}\n\\label{sec:difo}\n\n\\subsection{Foils and Connected Components}\nThe notion of discrete foliation can be defined for any\nfunction on any set. Since the present paper is focused on stochastic objects,\nonly measurable functions on measurable spaces will be considered. \n\nAssume $(X,{\\cal F})$ is a measurable space where all\nsingletons are measurable;\ni.e., for all $x\\in X$ one has $\\{x\\}\\in{\\cal F}$\nand let ${g}$ be a measurable map (or dynamics) on $X$\\footnote{  \nWhen $X$ is a topological space\nand ${g}$ is continuous, ${g}$ defines a topological dynamical\nsystem; when $X$ is equipped with a probability\nmeasure which is preserved by ${g}$, the latter defines a measure\npreserving dynamical system.}.\nLet ${\\sim_{{g}}}$ be the binary relation on the elements of $X$ defined by \n\\begin {equation*} {x{\\sim_{{g}}} y\\Leftrightarrow \\exists n\\in \\mathbb N;{g}^n(x) = {g}^n(y).} \\end {equation*}\nIt is immediate that ${\\sim_{{g}}}$ is an equivalence relation. \n\\begin{defi}\\label{foliation}\nThe partition of $X$ generated by the equivalence\nclasses of ${\\sim_{{g}}}$ will be called the \\emph{${g}$-foliation of $X$}.\nDenote it by ${\\cal L}^{(}_{{g}}X)$ or ${\\cal L}^{X}_{[}]{g}$.\nEach equivalence class is called a \\emph{foil}.\nThe equivalence class of $x\\in X$\nis denoted by ${L^{(}_{{g}}}x)$.\n\\end{defi}\n\n\\begin{rem}\nIn the terminology of geometry, foils are called leaves.\nBut since the paper uses graphs which are mostly trees,\nto avoid confusion with tree leaves,\nthe word foil will be used here. \n\\end{rem}\n\n\nOne can also see ${L^{(}_{{g}}}x)$ as the limit of the increasing\nsets ${L^{n}_{[}}] {g}(x)$, where \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "$${L^{n}_{[}}]{g} (x) := \\{y\\in X; {g}^n(y) = {g}^n(x)\\}.$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{L^{n}_{[}}]{g}(x):=\\{y\\in X;{g}^{n}(y)={g}^{n}(x)\\}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>L</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>n</mi></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>:=</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>;</mo><msup><mi>g</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>g</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03653.tex", "nexttext": "\nand therefore on ${{\\mathbb R}^d}$ as $ \\theta_t x = x-t$.\n\nLet ${\\mathbf N}^0$ be the subspace of ${\\mathbf N}$ of counting measures\nwith an atom at the origin.\n\nA $\\emph{(random) point process}$ is  a\ncouple ${(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})}$ where ${\\mathbb P}$ is a probability measure on a\nmeasurable space $({\\Omega},{\\cal F})$ and $\\Phi$ is a measurable mapping\nfrom $({\\Omega},{\\cal F})$ to $({\\mathbf N},{\\cal N})$.

The latter are defined as follows: it is well known that\nthe $d$ dimensional lattice ${\\Bbb Z}^d$ can be transformed into a\nstationary point process in ${\\mathbb R}^d$ by a uniform\nrandom shift of the origin in the $d$ unit cube.\nThe \\emph{Bernoulli grid}\nof ${\\mathbb R}^d$ is obtained in the same way when\nkeeping or discarding each of the lattice points \nindependently with probability $p$.\nThe result is again a stationary point process whose distribution will \nbe denoted by ${\\cal P}_p$.\n\\subsubsection{Strip  {Point-Shift}{}}\n\\label{ssStrip}\nThe Strip {Point-Shift}{} was introduced by Ferrari,\nLandim and Thorisson \\cite{FeLaTh04}. \nFor all points $x=(x_1,x_2)$ in the plane, let $St(x)$ denote the \nhalf strip $(x_1,\\infty)\\times [x_2-1/2,x_2+1/2]$. Then $S(x)$ is the\nleft most point of $St(x)$. It is easy to verify that $S$ is\nflow-adapted. Denote its {point-map}{} by $s$. \n\n\nThe strip {point-shift}{} is not well-defined when there are more than one\nleft most point in $St(x)$, nor when the\npoint process has no point (other than $x$) in $St(x)$.\nNote that such ambiguities\ncan always be removed, and some refined version\nof the strip {point-shift}{} can always be defined\nby fixing, in some flow-adapted manner, \nthe choice of the image and by choosing $f_\\phi(x)=x$\nin the case of non-existence. By doing so one gets a refined\n{point-shift}{} defined for all $(\\phi,x)$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Mutual Nearest Neighbor {Point-Shift}{}}\n\\label{ssMnn}\nTwo points $x$ and $y$ in $\\phi$ are mutual nearest neighbors \nif $\\phi(B^o(x,||x-y||))=\\phi(B^o(y,||x-y||))=1$ and\n$\\phi(B(x,||x-y||))=\\phi(B(y,||x-y||))=2$,\nwhere $B^o(z,r)$ (resp. $B(z,r)$) denotes the open\n(resp. closed) ball of center $z$ and radius $r$.\nThe Mutual Nearest Neighbor {Point-Shift}{} $N$\nis the involution which\nmaps $x$ to $y$ when these two points are mutual nearest neighbors\nand maps $z$ to itself if $z$ has no mutual nearest neighbor.\nThis {point-shift}{} is bijective. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Next Row {Point-Shift}{} on the Bernoulli Grid }\n\\label{ssGrid}\n\nThe \\emph{Next Row} {point-shift}{},\nwhich will be denoted by $R$, is defined on the $d$-dimensional \nBernoulli grid as follows:\n\\begin {equation*} {R_\\phi(x_1,\\ldots, x_d) = (x_1+1, x^\\prime_2, x_3,\\ldots, x_d),} \\end {equation*}\nwhere \n\\begin {equation*} {x^\\prime_2 = \\min \\{y\\geq x_2; (x_1+1,y, x_3,\\ldots, x_d)\\in\\phi\\}).} \\end {equation*}\nIt is easy to verify that if $d\\geq 2$ and $p>0$, $R$ is a.s. well-defined. \n\n\\subsubsection{Condenser {Point-Shift}{}s}\n\\label{ssCEPM}\nAssume each point $x\\in\\phi$ is marked with \n\\begin {equation*} {m_c(x)=\\#(\\phi\\cap B(x,1)).} \\end {equation*}\nNote that $m_c(x)$ \nis always positive. The \n\\emph{condenser {point-shift}} \nacts on  marked \npoint process as follows: it goes from each point $x\\in\\phi$\nto the closest point $y$ with a larger first coordinate such that\n$m_c(y)= m_c(x) + 1$.\nIt is easy to verify that the condenser \n{point-shift}{} is flow-adapted and almost surely well-defined\non the homogeneous Poisson point process.    \n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{On Finite Subsets of Point Process Supports}\nThis subsection contains some of the key\ntechnical results to be used in the proofs below.\nBelow, a counting measure will often be\nidentified with its support, namely with a discrete subset of\n${{\\mathbb R}^d}$.\n\\begin{lem}\\label{counting.given.point}\nLet ${\\cal X}\\subset {\\mathbf N}({{\\mathbb R}^d})$ be a family of discrete subsets of\n${{\\mathbb R}^d}$ such that, for all $t\\in{{\\mathbb R}^d}$ and $X\\in\\cal X$,\none has $\\theta_tX\\in\\cal X$. Assume $\\pi:{\\cal X}\\to \n{\\mathbf N}({{\\mathbb R}^d})$ is a measurable finite and non-empty\n\\emph{flow-adapted inclusion}, i.e., for all $t\\in{{\\mathbb R}^d}$ and all $X\\in\\cal X$,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n0<{|{{\\pi(X)}}|}<\\infty && \\text{(finite and non-empty),} \\\\\n\\pi(\\theta_t X)=\\theta_t\\pi(X) && \\text{(flow-adapted),}\\\\\n\\pi(X)\\subset X && \\text{(inclusion).}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nThen, there exists a flow-adapted numbering of the points of the elements\nof $\\cal X$.  \n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nFor all $X\\in\\cal X$ one can choose a point $y_1$ of\n$\\pi(X)$ in a flow-adapted manner;\ne.g. the least point in lexicographic order of ${\\mathbb R}^d$.\nThen considering $y_1$ as the first point,\none can number the other points of $X$ according to\ntheir distance to $y_1$ in an increasing order;\nif there are several points equidistant to $y$,\none can sort them in increasing lexicographic order.\nNote that the fact that $X$ is discrete implies\nthere are at most finitely many points in $B_r(y)$\nfor all given $y$ and hence the above numbering is well-defined. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{no.finite.invariant.collection}\nLet $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$ be a stationary point process and $n=n(\\Phi)$ be\na measurable flow-adapted random variable taking\nits values in $\\overline{\\Bbb N}= \\Bbb N\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$. \nLet $\\Psi=\\{\\Psi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a flow-adapted\ncollection of infinite, pairwise disjoint measurable\nsubsets of $\\Phi$.

Denote this\ncollection by $\\Psi=\\{\\Psi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $n$ may be infinity.\nCorollary~\\ref{monotone.cardinal.foils} implies that each $\\Psi_i$\nshould have a largest finite foil, say $\\Xi_i$,\nwhere the order is that based on seniority (Definition~\\ref{foils.order}).\nTherefore, $\\Psi=\\{\\Psi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\\Xi=\\{\\Xi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$\nsatisfy the assumptions of Theorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}\nand this is hence a contradiction.\nSo, {almost surely}, there is no connected component with both \nfinite and infinite foils, which proves that each\nacyclic component is either of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$ or ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$.   \n\nLet $C$ be a connected component of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\nAlmost surely, $C$ cannot \nhave a smallest foil. Otherwise the latter\nwould again be a finite flow-adapted subset of\nthe infinite connected component $C$, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\nThis proves the second assertion on the foils of $C$ in this case.\nNow let $L_0$ be an arbitrary foil of $C$ and,\nfor all integers $i$,\nlet $L_i$ be the foil ${F}_\\phi^i(L_0)$. \nSince $L_0$ is finite, there exists a least\nnon-negative integer $n$\nsuch that ${F}^n(L_0)$ is a single point.  Let\n\\begin {equation*} {C_0:=\\{{F}_\\phi^m(L_0),\\ -\\infty<m<n\\},} \\end {equation*}\nThe graph $G^{F}(C_0)$ is infinite, connected \nand all its vertices are of finite degree.\nIt hence follows from K\\\"onig's infinity lemma \\cite{Ko90}\nthat $G^{F}(C_0)$ has an infinite path $\\{x_i\\}_{i\\leq 0}$.\nFor $i>0$, define $x_i:={F}_\\phi^i(x_0)$. \nThen $(x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}$ is a bi-infinite path.\nClearly $(x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}\\subset {F}_\\phi^\\infty(C)$.\nSince all edges of $G^{F}(C)$ are from a foil $L$ to the foil $L_+$,\n$(x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}$ has exactly one vertex in each foil.\nFinally for each point $y$ in an arbitrary foil $L(x_i)$,\nthere exists $m>0$ such that ${F}_\\phi^m(y)={F}_\\phi^m(x_i)=x_{i+m}$\nand hence ${F}^\\infty(C)\\subset (x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}$,\nwhich completes the proof of the properties of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\n \nConsider now $C$ of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ and assume that ${F_\\phi}^\\infty(C)$ is not empty.\nIf $x$ is a primeval element of $C$, then $G^{F}(D(x))$ is an infinite connected\ngraph with vertices of finite degree and hence it possesses\nan infinite path, which in turn gives a bi-infinite path using the\nsame construction as what was described above for the Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\nHence, in order to prove that\n${F_\\phi}^\\infty(C)$ is empty, it is sufficient to\nshow that $C$ has no bi-infinite path. \nIf $C$ has finitely many bi-infinite paths, then the intersections\nof these bi-infinite paths with each foil of $C$ give a collection\nof finite subsets of infinite sets, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\nConsider now the case where $C$ has infinitely-many bi-infinite paths.\nSince $C$ is connected, each two bi-infinite paths should intersect\nat some point. Let $J=J(C)$ be the set of all points $x\\in C$ \nsuch that at least two bi-infinite paths join at $x$.\nIt is now shown that, {almost surely},\nthe intersection of a bi-infinite path and $J$ has neither a first\nnor a last point for the order induced by ${F}$.\nIf it has a first (resp. last) point, then the part of the\npath before the first (resp. after the last) point\nis an infinite flow-adapted set with \na finite flow-adapted subset, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\nTherefore, for each point $x\\in J$, there is a smallest\npositive integer $n(J,x)$ such that ${F_\\phi}^{n(J,x)}\\in J$.  \nNow define a point-shift $h$ on the whole point process as follows\n\\begin {equation*} { h(x)= \\begin{cases} {F_\\phi}^{n(J,x)} & x\\in J(C)\\\\ x & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} } \\end {equation*}\nSince the intersection of any bi-infinite path with $J$\ndoes not have a first point, $h$ is {almost surely}{} surjective.\nBut from the very definition of $J$, all points of \nthis set have at least two pre-images, which contradicts\nCorollary~\\ref{surjective.injective}. Hence the situation\nwith infinitely-many bi-infinite paths is not possible either, which\nconcludes the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn graph theoretic terms,\none can summarize the results discussed in the last\nproof as follows:\n\\begin{cor}\n\\label{cor-1-2}\nA Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ component has one (positive) end.\nA Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$ component has two ends (a positive and a negative one).    \n\\end{cor}\n\nTheorem~\\ref{cardinality.components} also has the following corollary:\n\n\\begin{cor}\nFor all stationary point processes $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$, for all\npoint-shifts ${F}$, there exist three stationary point processes\n$(\\Phi_{{\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}},{\\mathbb P})$, $(\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}},{\\mathbb P})$ and $(\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}},{\\mathbb P})$ \n(which may be empty with positive probability),\nall defined on the same probability space, and such that\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 23240, "prevtext": "\nand therefore on ${{\\mathbb R}^d}$ as $ \\theta_t x = x-t$.\n\nLet ${\\mathbf N}^0$ be the subspace of ${\\mathbf N}$ of counting measures\nwith an atom at the origin.\n\nA $\\emph{(random) point process}$ is  a\ncouple ${(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})}$ where ${\\mathbb P}$ is a probability measure on a\nmeasurable space $({\\Omega},{\\cal F})$ and $\\Phi$ is a measurable mapping\nfrom $({\\Omega},{\\cal F})$ to $({\\mathbf N},{\\cal N})$.

The latter are defined as follows: it is well known that\nthe $d$ dimensional lattice ${\\Bbb Z}^d$ can be transformed into a\nstationary point process in ${\\mathbb R}^d$ by a uniform\nrandom shift of the origin in the $d$ unit cube.\nThe \\emph{Bernoulli grid}\nof ${\\mathbb R}^d$ is obtained in the same way when\nkeeping or discarding each of the lattice points \nindependently with probability $p$.\nThe result is again a stationary point process whose distribution will \nbe denoted by ${\\cal P}_p$.\n\\subsubsection{Strip  {Point-Shift}{}}\n\\label{ssStrip}\nThe Strip {Point-Shift}{} was introduced by Ferrari,\nLandim and Thorisson \\cite{FeLaTh04}. \nFor all points $x=(x_1,x_2)$ in the plane, let $St(x)$ denote the \nhalf strip $(x_1,\\infty)\\times [x_2-1/2,x_2+1/2]$. Then $S(x)$ is the\nleft most point of $St(x)$. It is easy to verify that $S$ is\nflow-adapted. Denote its {point-map}{} by $s$. \n\n\nThe strip {point-shift}{} is not well-defined when there are more than one\nleft most point in $St(x)$, nor when the\npoint process has no point (other than $x$) in $St(x)$.\nNote that such ambiguities\ncan always be removed, and some refined version\nof the strip {point-shift}{} can always be defined\nby fixing, in some flow-adapted manner, \nthe choice of the image and by choosing $f_\\phi(x)=x$\nin the case of non-existence. By doing so one gets a refined\n{point-shift}{} defined for all $(\\phi,x)$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Mutual Nearest Neighbor {Point-Shift}{}}\n\\label{ssMnn}\nTwo points $x$ and $y$ in $\\phi$ are mutual nearest neighbors \nif $\\phi(B^o(x,||x-y||))=\\phi(B^o(y,||x-y||))=1$ and\n$\\phi(B(x,||x-y||))=\\phi(B(y,||x-y||))=2$,\nwhere $B^o(z,r)$ (resp. $B(z,r)$) denotes the open\n(resp. closed) ball of center $z$ and radius $r$.\nThe Mutual Nearest Neighbor {Point-Shift}{} $N$\nis the involution which\nmaps $x$ to $y$ when these two points are mutual nearest neighbors\nand maps $z$ to itself if $z$ has no mutual nearest neighbor.\nThis {point-shift}{} is bijective. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Next Row {Point-Shift}{} on the Bernoulli Grid }\n\\label{ssGrid}\n\nThe \\emph{Next Row} {point-shift}{},\nwhich will be denoted by $R$, is defined on the $d$-dimensional \nBernoulli grid as follows:\n\\begin {equation*} {R_\\phi(x_1,\\ldots, x_d) = (x_1+1, x^\\prime_2, x_3,\\ldots, x_d),} \\end {equation*}\nwhere \n\\begin {equation*} {x^\\prime_2 = \\min \\{y\\geq x_2; (x_1+1,y, x_3,\\ldots, x_d)\\in\\phi\\}).} \\end {equation*}\nIt is easy to verify that if $d\\geq 2$ and $p>0$, $R$ is a.s. well-defined. \n\n\\subsubsection{Condenser {Point-Shift}{}s}\n\\label{ssCEPM}\nAssume each point $x\\in\\phi$ is marked with \n\\begin {equation*} {m_c(x)=\\#(\\phi\\cap B(x,1)).} \\end {equation*}\nNote that $m_c(x)$ \nis always positive. The \n\\emph{condenser {point-shift}} \nacts on  marked \npoint process as follows: it goes from each point $x\\in\\phi$\nto the closest point $y$ with a larger first coordinate such that\n$m_c(y)= m_c(x) + 1$.\nIt is easy to verify that the condenser \n{point-shift}{} is flow-adapted and almost surely well-defined\non the homogeneous Poisson point process.    \n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{On Finite Subsets of Point Process Supports}\nThis subsection contains some of the key\ntechnical results to be used in the proofs below.\nBelow, a counting measure will often be\nidentified with its support, namely with a discrete subset of\n${{\\mathbb R}^d}$.\n\\begin{lem}\\label{counting.given.point}\nLet ${\\cal X}\\subset {\\mathbf N}({{\\mathbb R}^d})$ be a family of discrete subsets of\n${{\\mathbb R}^d}$ such that, for all $t\\in{{\\mathbb R}^d}$ and $X\\in\\cal X$,\none has $\\theta_tX\\in\\cal X$.

It follows that there is a countable\ncollection of connected components. Each of them\nis of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$, and hence not markable. The foil\nof a point is the singleton containing this point.\nThe set of descendants of a point $x$ consists of those points \non the same horizontal line which are located on left side of $x$. \nEach connected component has two ends. Its foliation has\nthe same order as ${\\Bbb Z}$ but is not markable.\n\nAnother example of this class is\nleverages the Strip {point-shift}{} on a stationary Poisson point process \n$(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$ of ${\\mathbb R}^2$ and ${\\mathbb R}^3$. This  {point-shift}{}\nhas a single connected component \\cite{FeLaTh04}. The RLS ordering\n(see the proof of Proposition~\\ref{existence.f.orthogonal})\nhence defines a total order on $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$, which\nis equivalent to that of ${\\Bbb Z}$. This allows one to\ndefine the RLS {Point-Shift}\\ ${F}_{\\mbox{\\small{rls}}}$ which associates to\n$x\\in \\Phi$ the unique point $y\\in \\Phi$ such that $x$\ncomes next to $y$ in this total order. This {point-shift}{} is clearly bijective.\nHence the foil of $x$ is $\\{x\\}$. The unique connected component\nof this {point-shift}{} is thus\nof class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\nThe unique connected \ncomponent has two ends. Its foliation has the same order as ${\\Bbb Z}$.\nIt is not markable.\n\nNote that these two examples are bijective {point-shift} s. But there are cases \nof type $\\cal I/I$ which are not bijective.  \n\n\\subsubsection{Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$}\n\nHere are three examples illustrating that this class of {point-shift}{}s\ncan have either markable or non markable foliations.\n\n\\begin{prop}\nThe Next Row {point-shift}{} on the 2-dimensional Bernoulli grid \nwith $0<p<1$, has a single connected component of type \n$\\cal I/I$. Foils of this connected component are not markable.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThere is a single connected component and each foil consists\nof all points of the point process on a vertical line\n(Figure~\\ref{next.row.foils}). \nTherefore all foils are infinite and the connected component is of type \n$\\cal I/I$. If foils of this connected component were markable, \nthe partition of the point process into horizontal lines would form\na collection of infinite disjoint subsets of the Bernoulli grid.\nThe intersection of these subsets \nwith a some fixed foil is a finite non-empty inclusion, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{prop}\nThe Condenser {point-shift}{} on the Poisson point process in ${\\mathbb R}$ has \na single $\\cal I/I$ connected component and the foliation is markable. \n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nIt is easy to see that if $\\lambda_n$ is the intensity \nof points with the mark $m_c$ equal to $n$, where \n$m_c$ is defined in Example~\\ref{ssCEPM}, then $\\lambda_n$ tends \nto zero as $n$ tends to $\\infty$. Using this, one can conclude \nthat the condenser {point-shift}{} has a single connected component. \nEach foil consists of all points with the same mark $m_c$.\nThe foliation has the order of $\\mathbb N$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nHere are further examples of this class.\nThe authors in \\cite{FeLaTh04} prove that  the Strip {point-shift}{} $S$\non the Poisson point process in ${\\mathbb R}^2$, \nhas a single connected component which is one ended.\nTherefore this connected component evaporates under the action of ${f_{s}}$ \nand is of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$.\nOn a Poisson point process,\nthe expander point-shift also has a single connected component\nwhich evaporate under the action of the {point-shift}{}.\nThis component is of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$.\n\n\\section{Partition Preserving Point-Maps}\n\\label{sec:pppm}\n\nIt is well-known that all bijective {point-shift} s preserve\nthe Palm probability of stationary point processes\nand that this property characterizes the Palm probabilities\nof stationary point processes \\cite{Me75}.\n\nThis section features\na fixed {point-shift}{} ${F}$ and considers the class \nof bijective {point-shift} s which preserve the two partitions\n${\\cal C}^{=}_{{{F}}} {\\cal C}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{{F}_{\\Phi}}$ and\n${\\cal L}^{=}_{{F}} {\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{{F}_{\\Phi}}$\nof a stationary point process $\\Phi$. \n\n\\subsection {Bijective {Point-Shift} s Preserving Components}\nLet $\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{}}^{F}:=\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{{F}}}(\\Phi)$ be the \n${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group as defined in Definition~\\ref{stable.group}.\nAs mentioned in Definition~\\ref{stable.group}, $\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{}}^{F}$\nis a subgroup\nof the symmetric group on the support\nof $\\Phi$.\n\n\\begin{prop}\n\\label{existence.f.orthogonalC}\nFor each {point-shift}{} ${F}$ and each stationary point process $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$,\nthere exists a ${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-dense element (see Definition~\\ref{stable.group}) of the\n${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group; i.e., there exists $H\\in\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{}}^{F}$ such that \nfor all $x\\in \\Phi$,\n\\begin {equation*} {\\{{H}^i(x);i\\in{\\Bbb Z}\\}={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x).} \\end {equation*}\nThere is no uniqueness in general.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThe construction of $H$ is different for each of the three classes\nof components identified in Theorem \\ref{cardinality.components}.\nIn each case, the first step is the construction of a total order on the\npoints of $C$ which is flow-adapted and the second one\nis the definition of a dense and bijective {point-shift}{}\npreserving $C$.\n\nIf $C={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x)$ is of ${\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}$ class, then\nit is easy to create a total order which is translation\ninvariant on the points of $C$ as\nit is a finite set (e.g. using lexicographic order) with\npoints that can be numbered $0,1,\\ldots,n-1$ for some integer\n$n=n(x)\\ge 1$. A flow-adapted bijection $H$\npreserving $C$ is then easy to build by taking $H=M_n$\nwith $M_n(k)=k+1$ mod $n$.\n\nIf $C={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x)$ is of ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$ class, then,\nthe existence of a single bi-infinite path in $G^F(C)$ (see \nTheorem \\ref{cardinality.components}) and the\nfiniteness of the foils can be used to construct a total order.\nLet $\\{x_n\\}_{n\\in {\\Bbb Z}}$ be the bi-infinite path in question\nand let\n$L_n$ denote the foil of $x_n$.  \nSince $L_n$ is finite for all $n$, one can use the lexicographic\norder to create a total order between its points. The total order is\nthen obtained by saying that all points of $L_n$ have precedence over\nthose of $L_{n-1}$. This total order, which is that of ${\\Bbb Z}$,\nis flow-adapted.\nThe bijective {point-shift}{} is that associating to a point $x$ of $C$ \nits direct successor for this order. This {point-shift}{} will be referred\nto as the Bi-Infinite Path {Point-Shift}{} $B$, with associated {point-map}{} $b$.\nOn such a component, one takes $H=B$.\n\nIf $C={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x)$ is of ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ class, then\nthe construction uses a total order on the nodes\nof $G^{F}(C)$ known as RLS (Royal Line of Succession).\nThe latter order is based on two ingredients:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item A local (total) order\namong the sons of a given node in $G^{F}(C)$.\nThis can be done as follows: for a given point $x$ of $C$\nlet $B^{F}(x)=B^{F}_\\phi(x)$ be the set of its brothers; i.e.,  \n\\begin {equation*} {B^{F}(x):=\\{y\\in\\phi;{F}_\\phi(x)={F}_\\phi(y)\\}. } \\end {equation*}\nThe elements of $B^{F}(x)$ can then be ordered in a flow-adapted\nmanner using the lexicographic order of the Euclidean space.\n\\item The Depth First Search (DFS - see Appendix \\ref{AB})\npre-order on rooted trees.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe RLS order on a rooted tree is a total order\non a finite tree obtained by combining (1) and (2):\nDFS is used throughout and the sons of any given node are visited\nin the order prescribed by (1), with priority given to the\nolder son.\n\nIt is now explained how this also creates a total order on the nodes\nof $C$. For $x,y\\in C$, there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such\nthat ${F_\\phi}^m(x)={F_\\phi}^n(y)$. One says that $x\\geq_r y$ if $x$ has\nRLS priority over $y$ in the rooted tree of descendants\nof ${F}_\\phi^m(x)$. This tree is a.s. finite because  \nin the ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ case, there is evaporation\nof $C$ by the {point-shift}{}, which this in turn implies that\nfor all points $z\\in \\phi$, the total number of descendents\nof $z$ is a.s. finite.\nThe DFS preordering on descendants of a node in a tree forms an\ninterval of this preordering. This implies that $\\geq_r$ \nis a well-defined order on $C$ and also that it orders elements of\n$C$ in the same linear order as that of an interval in ${\\Bbb Z}$.\nFurthermore, since $C$ is infinite,\nthis order on $C$ \ncannot have a greatest element or a least element.\nOtherwise the greatest and the least elements would be a finite\nflow-adapted subset of $C$ or the foil,\nwhich contradicts Theorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}. \nTherefore the order on $C$ as well as its restriction to a foil\nis a linear order, similar to that of ${\\Bbb Z}$.\n\nOn such a components, one defined \n$H=R$ where $R$ denotes the RLS {point-shift}{},\nnamely the {point-shift}{} that associates to each point its \nsuccessor in the RLS order, which is bijective and translation \ninvariant.\n\\end{proof}\n \nLet $h$ denote the {point-map}{} of the {point-shift}{} $H$ defined\nin the last theorem.\nNotice that since $H$ is bijective, the dynamical system $({\\mathbf N}^0,\\theta_{h})$\npreserves ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Bijective {Point-Shift} s Preserving Foils}\nThe results of this subsection parallel those of the\nlast subsection, with an important refinement which is\nthat of \\emph{order preservation}.\n\nLet $\\Gamma_L^{F}:=\\Gamma_L^{F}(\\Phi)$ denote the set of all bijective\nand ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-preserving {point-shift} s.\nThis group, which is called the \\emph{${\\cal L}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group},\nis a subgroup of the ${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group. \n\nAs above, \nan element ${H}$ of the ${\\cal L}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group\nis said to be ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-dense if\n\\begin {equation*} {\\{{H}_\\phi^i(x);i\\in{\\Bbb Z}\\}={L^{\\phi}_{[}}]{F}(x).} \\end {equation*}\n\nEach ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-dense element ${H}$ of the ${\\cal L}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group\ninduces a total order $\\preceq_{H}$  on the elements of each infinite\nfoil of $C$ by \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 46756, "prevtext": "\n\nAn enumeration of the elements of a set is an \ninjective function $\\nu$ from from this set to $\\Bbb N$\n(or equivalently to  ${\\Bbb Z}$).\nThere are several enumerations of the elements of the partition ${\\cal T}$;\ne.g. based on the distance to the origin.

If the latter is finite,\nit possesses exactly one cycle. This proves the first statement. \n\nLet $n=n(\\Phi)$ be the number of connected components of $G^{F}(\\Phi)$\nwhich are infinite and possess a cycle. Let $\\Psi=\\{\\Psi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ \ndenote the collection of such components.\nNote that $n$ may be infinite. According to\nLemma~\\ref{cyclic.component}, each $\\Psi_i$ has exactly one\ncycle. This cycle is a finite non-empty\nflow-adapted subset of $\\Psi_i$,\nwhich contradicts Theorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\nTherefore {almost surely}, there is no such component.\n \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\nThe next corollary follows from Lemma \\ref{cyclic.component}. \n\\begin{cor}\\label{connected.so.tree} \nIf $G^{F}(\\Phi)$ is almost surely connected, it is almost surely a tree. \n\\end{cor}\n\\vspace{.2cm}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\\ref{cardinality.components}] \nThe result for connected components of Class~${\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}$\nis an immediate consequence of Lemma~\\ref{cyclic.component}. \n\nAssume $C$ is an infinite component.\nAccording to Proposition~\\ref{infinite.acyclic}, $C$ is acyclic. \nConsider the collection of all connected components with\nboth finite and infinite foils. Denote this\ncollection by $\\Psi=\\{\\Psi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $n$ may be infinity.\nCorollary~\\ref{monotone.cardinal.foils} implies that each $\\Psi_i$\nshould have a largest finite foil, say $\\Xi_i$,\nwhere the order is that based on seniority (Definition~\\ref{foils.order}).\nTherefore, $\\Psi=\\{\\Psi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\\Xi=\\{\\Xi_i\\}_{i=1}^n$\nsatisfy the assumptions of Theorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}\nand this is hence a contradiction.\nSo, {almost surely}, there is no connected component with both \nfinite and infinite foils, which proves that each\nacyclic component is either of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$ or ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$.   \n\nLet $C$ be a connected component of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\nAlmost surely, $C$ cannot \nhave a smallest foil. Otherwise the latter\nwould again be a finite flow-adapted subset of\nthe infinite connected component $C$, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\nThis proves the second assertion on the foils of $C$ in this case.\nNow let $L_0$ be an arbitrary foil of $C$ and,\nfor all integers $i$,\nlet $L_i$ be the foil ${F}_\\phi^i(L_0)$. \nSince $L_0$ is finite, there exists a least\nnon-negative integer $n$\nsuch that ${F}^n(L_0)$ is a single point.  Let\n\\begin {equation*} {C_0:=\\{{F}_\\phi^m(L_0),\\ -\\infty<m<n\\},} \\end {equation*}\nThe graph $G^{F}(C_0)$ is infinite, connected \nand all its vertices are of finite degree.\nIt hence follows from K\\\"onig's infinity lemma \\cite{Ko90}\nthat $G^{F}(C_0)$ has an infinite path $\\{x_i\\}_{i\\leq 0}$.\nFor $i>0$, define $x_i:={F}_\\phi^i(x_0)$. \nThen $(x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}$ is a bi-infinite path.\nClearly $(x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}\\subset {F}_\\phi^\\infty(C)$.\nSince all edges of $G^{F}(C)$ are from a foil $L$ to the foil $L_+$,\n$(x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}$ has exactly one vertex in each foil.\nFinally for each point $y$ in an arbitrary foil $L(x_i)$,\nthere exists $m>0$ such that ${F}_\\phi^m(y)={F}_\\phi^m(x_i)=x_{i+m}$\nand hence ${F}^\\infty(C)\\subset (x_i)_{i\\in{\\Bbb Z}}$,\nwhich completes the proof of the properties of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\n \nConsider now $C$ of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ and assume that ${F_\\phi}^\\infty(C)$ is not empty.\nIf $x$ is a primeval element of $C$, then $G^{F}(D(x))$ is an infinite connected\ngraph with vertices of finite degree and hence it possesses\nan infinite path, which in turn gives a bi-infinite path using the\nsame construction as what was described above for the Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\nHence, in order to prove that\n${F_\\phi}^\\infty(C)$ is empty, it is sufficient to\nshow that $C$ has no bi-infinite path. \nIf $C$ has finitely many bi-infinite paths, then the intersections\nof these bi-infinite paths with each foil of $C$ give a collection\nof finite subsets of infinite sets, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\nConsider now the case where $C$ has infinitely-many bi-infinite paths.\nSince $C$ is connected, each two bi-infinite paths should intersect\nat some point. Let $J=J(C)$ be the set of all points $x\\in C$ \nsuch that at least two bi-infinite paths join at $x$.\nIt is now shown that, {almost surely},\nthe intersection of a bi-infinite path and $J$ has neither a first\nnor a last point for the order induced by ${F}$.\nIf it has a first (resp. last) point, then the part of the\npath before the first (resp. after the last) point\nis an infinite flow-adapted set with \na finite flow-adapted subset, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\nTherefore, for each point $x\\in J$, there is a smallest\npositive integer $n(J,x)$ such that ${F_\\phi}^{n(J,x)}\\in J$.  \nNow define a point-shift $h$ on the whole point process as follows\n\\begin {equation*} { h(x)= \\begin{cases} {F_\\phi}^{n(J,x)} & x\\in J(C)\\\\ x & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} } \\end {equation*}\nSince the intersection of any bi-infinite path with $J$\ndoes not have a first point, $h$ is {almost surely}{} surjective.\nBut from the very definition of $J$, all points of \nthis set have at least two pre-images, which contradicts\nCorollary~\\ref{surjective.injective}. Hence the situation\nwith infinitely-many bi-infinite paths is not possible either, which\nconcludes the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn graph theoretic terms,\none can summarize the results discussed in the last\nproof as follows:\n\\begin{cor}\n\\label{cor-1-2}\nA Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ component has one (positive) end.\nA Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$ component has two ends (a positive and a negative one).    \n\\end{cor}\n\nTheorem~\\ref{cardinality.components} also has the following corollary:\n\n\\begin{cor}\nFor all stationary point processes $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$, for all\npoint-shifts ${F}$, there exist three stationary point processes\n$(\\Phi_{{\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}},{\\mathbb P})$, $(\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}},{\\mathbb P})$ and $(\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}},{\\mathbb P})$ \n(which may be empty with positive probability),\nall defined on the same probability space, and such that\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "$$\\Phi= \\Phi_{{\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}}+\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}}+\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}}.$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Phi=\\Phi_{{\\mathcal{F}}/{\\mathcal{F}}}+\\Phi_{{\\mathcal{I}}/{\\mathcal{F}}}+%&#10;\\Phi_{{\\mathcal{I}}/{\\mathcal{I}}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2131</mi><mo>/</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2131</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2110</mi><mo>/</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2131</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2110</mi><mo>/</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2110</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03653.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis total order is flow-adapted.

Similarly, if $C_0$\nis not markable, then the distribution ${\\cal R}_0$\nof $\\Psi(C_0)$ is not the\nPalm distribution of a stationary\npoint process.\n\nIt follows from the above considerations\nthat both in the markable and the\nnon-markable cases, ${\\cal Q}_0$ (resp. ${\\cal R}_0$) is preserved\nby $\\theta_{{f_\\bot}}$ (resp. $\\theta_h$). This invariance property\nis of course classical in the markable case.\n\nThe fact that it holds in general can be phrased\nas follows: for all \n(non--necessarily measure preserving) \ndynamics $f$

$\\Phi_{{\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}}$ and\n$\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}}$ are empty, then each ${F}$-foil\nof $\\Phi$ has an infinite number of points (Corollary \\ref{cor26}),\nand the typical point\nhas a number of descendants which is a.s. finite (Corollary \\ref{cor25}) \nbut with infinite mean (Proposition \\ref{mn1}), and hence heavy tailed.\nSee Subsection \\ref{ssStrip} for an example.\n\n\\item\nIf $\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}}$ is empty, then each ${F}$-foil\nof $\\Phi$ has an a.s. finite number of points \n(Theorem \\ref{cardinality.components});\nthe typical point has descendants of all orders with a positive probability\\footnote{With probability 1 iff ${F}$ is bijective.}\n(Corollary \\ref{cor25}),\nand hence an infinite number of descendants. However,\nthe expected number of descendants of order $n$ \ndoes not diverge in mean (Corollary \\ref{cor28}) as $n$ tends to infinity.\nIf in addition $\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}}$ is empty, then\nthe set of descendants of the typical point\nlooks like a ``finite star with a loop at the center''.\nSee Subsection \\ref{ssMnn} for an example.\nIf in place $\\Phi_{{\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}}$ is empty, then\nthe set of descendants of the typical point is either finite or\nlooks like an ``infinite path with finite trees attached to it''.\nThe points in this infinite path\nconstitute a sub-stationary point process.\nThis point process always has a\npositive intensity.\n(For instance, for the RLS {point-shift}{} on the Poisson\npoint process in ${\\mathbb R}^2$, this is the\nwhole point process. There exist cases where \n$F$ is not bijective and the connected components are \nof type $\\cal I/F$ and hence such that this \nsub-point process is not the whole point process.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Foil Intensities} \nThis subsection is focused on the intensity of the ${F}$-foils.\nFrom Proposition \\ref{thdic}, either all foils of a markable component are \nflow-adapted point processes, or none of them are.\nThe notion of intensity only makes sense in the former case.\nThe notion of {\\em relative intensity} defined in the next subsection allows\none to discuss the ``density'' of foils in whole generality, namely\nregardless of the above dichotomy.\n\n\\subsubsection{Relative Intensities}\nBelow, when considering a component\nof Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$, it is assumed that\n${{F}_\\bot}$ is an ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-dense \nelement of the ${F}$-stable group and that\n$\\preceq_{{{F}_\\bot}}$ is ${F}$-compatible.\n\n\nLet ${f}_\\bot$ denote the {point-map}{} of ${{F}_\\bot}$ and let ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$\ndenote its related shift on ${\\mathbf N}^0$.

This fact justifies the\nuse of the term ``foliation'' within this context (see e.g. \\cite{An01}).\n\\end{rem}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $x$ is in a connected component of $G^{F}(\\phi)$ which is \n${\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}$ or\n${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$, all statements \nfollow from finiteness of the foils.\nHence assume $C(0)$ is ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$. \nHence it is sufficient to show that, for ${\\cal P}_0$ almost\nall $\\phi$, the  limit  \n\\begin {equation} {\\label{relative.intensity.n0}\\lambda_+(\\phi)= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{{\\Delta}\\left({\\theta_{{f}}} \\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)} {{\\Delta}\\left( \\phi,{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)},} \\end {equation}\nexists and is positive, finite and constant on the\nfoil ${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$ provided the latter is infinite.\nLet $ {\\Delta}_+(\\phi):= {\\Delta}({\\theta_{{f}}}\\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}\\phi)$.\nNow consider the following mass transport:\n\\begin {equation*} {w(\\phi,x,y)= \\begin{cases} 1 & y\\in {L^{+}_{[}}]{F}(x) \\text{ and } 0  {\\le} {\\Delta}({F}_\\phi(x),y)  {<} {\\Delta}({F}_\\phi(x), {F}_\\phi\\circ{{F}_\\bot}(x))\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} } \\end {equation*}\nOne has, for all points $x,y\\in\\phi$, $w^-(y)\\leq 1$\nand $w_+(x)= {\\Delta}_+ (\\theta_x\\phi)$. Therefore\n\\begin {equation*} {{{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}\\left[ {\\Delta}_{+}\\right] = {{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}\\left[ w^+(0)\\right] = {{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}\\left[ w^-(0)\\right]\\leq 1.} \\end {equation*} \nSince  the denominator in (\\ref{relative.intensity.n0}) is equal to $n$, \none has \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{{\\Delta}\\left({\\theta_{{f}}}\\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)}{{\\Delta}\\left( \\phi,{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)}\n&=&\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac 1n {\\sum_{i=1}^n {\\Delta}\\left({\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^{i-1}\\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^{i-1}\\phi\\right)}\\\\\n&=& \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac 1n {\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  {\\Delta}_+ \\left({\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^{i}\\phi\\right)}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nSince ${{F}_\\bot}$ is ${\\mathbb P}$-{almost surely}{} bijective, ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$ is ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$-invariant.\nTherefore if one denotes by $\\cal I$\n the invariant $\\sigma$-field of ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$,\n  the finiteness of ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[ {\\Delta}_+]$ implies that the last\nlimit exists for ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$-almost all $\\phi$ and\nit is equal to ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[ {\\Delta}_+|{\\cal I}]$, which is finite\nand invariant under the action of ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$;\ni.e., it is a function of ${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$. \n\nTo prove that $\\lambda_+(\\phi)$ is a.s. positive, note that, if $Y$\nis the event of being the youngest son of the family, then\n$\\tilde {\\Delta}\\geq {\\mathbf 1}_Y$. Hence if, with positive probability, \n$\\lambda_+(\\phi)=0$, this means that, with positive probability,\n${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[{\\mathbf 1}_Y|{\\cal I}]$ is zero. But since ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}$ is ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$-invariant,\nthis means that, with positive probability, there is no youngest son\non the foil of ${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$, which means that all points of\n${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$ are brothers. \nSince $C^{\\theta_{{f}}}(\\phi)$ is infinite, this contradicts the a.s.\nfiniteness of $d_1({F}_\\phi(0))$.\n\nFinally to prove that $\\lambda_+(\\phi)$ is independent of the choice of ${{F}_\\bot}$,\nit is sufficient to show that ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[{\\Delta_+}|{\\cal I}]$ depends only on $f$.\nTo do so, it is enough to prove that\nfor all $A\\in {\\cal I}$, ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[{\\Delta_+}{\\mathbf 1}_{A}]$ depends only on $f$.\nSince $A\\in{\\cal I}$, with abuse of notation, one has \n${\\mathbf 1}_A(\\phi) = {\\mathbf 1}_A({L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi))$.\nLet\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nA_+ &=&\\{{\\theta_{{f}}} \\phi; \\phi\\in A\\},\\\\\n{L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(A) &=& \\{\\phi\\in{\\mathbf N}^0;{L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(\\phi)\\neq\\emptyset \\text{ and } {L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(\\phi)\\in A \\}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nIt is easy to see that ${L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(A)\\in{\\cal I}$.

An example of this situation\nis provided by the Mutual Nearest Neighbor {Point-Shift}{} $N$ \non Poisson point process on ${\\mathbb R}^2$ (see below).\n\nIf $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$ only has ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$ components,\nthen the cardinality of ${\\cal C}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{{F}_{\\Phi}}$ may be finite\nor infinite.\nAn example of the first situation is provided by\nthe Royal Line of Succession\n{Point-Shift}{} on Poisson point processes on ${\\mathbb R}^2$\n(see below).\nAn example of the latter is provided by the Strip\n{Point-Shift}{} $S$ on the Bernoulli grid of dimension 2.\n\nIf $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$ only has ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ components,\nthen the cardinality of ${\\cal C}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{{F}_{\\Phi}}$ may again be finite\nor infinite.\nAn example of the first situation is provided by\nthe Strip\n{Point-Shift}{} $S$ on Poisson point processes on ${\\mathbb R}^2$.\nAn example with infinite cardinality\nis provided in Subsection \\ref{ssMultiStrip} of the appendix.\n\nThe end of this section gathers \nexamples of the three classes.\n\n\\subsubsection{Class~${\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}$}\nFor the Mutual Nearest Neighbor {Point-Shift}{} $N$\non a Poisson point process,\nthere is no evaporation and there is\nan infinite number of connected\ncomponents, all of class~${\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}$.\nThe order of the foils is that of ${\\Bbb Z}$ mod 2 or ${\\Bbb Z}$ mod 1.\nThe foil partition is\nthe singleton partition, hence\nnot markable.\nThe connected component partition is not markable either.\n\n\\subsubsection{Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$}\nAn example of this class is provided by the strip {point-shift}{}\non 2-dimensional Bernoulli grids.\nIt is easy to see that the connected  components of ${F}_s$ \nare the {\\em horizontal\nsub-processes} which look like 1-dimensional Bernoulli grid. \nThe {point-shift}{} ${F}_s$\nis a bijection which leaves each of the connected components\ninvariant. It follows that there is a countable\ncollection of connected components. Each of them\nis of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$, and hence not markable. The foil\nof a point is the singleton containing this point.\nThe set of descendants of a point $x$ consists of those points \non the same horizontal line which are located on left side of $x$. \nEach connected component has two ends. Its foliation has\nthe same order as ${\\Bbb Z}$ but is not markable.\n\nAnother example of this class is\nleverages the Strip {point-shift}{} on a stationary Poisson point process \n$(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$ of ${\\mathbb R}^2$ and ${\\mathbb R}^3$. This  {point-shift}{}\nhas a single connected component \\cite{FeLaTh04}. The RLS ordering\n(see the proof of Proposition~\\ref{existence.f.orthogonal})\nhence defines a total order on $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$, which\nis equivalent to that of ${\\Bbb Z}$. This allows one to\ndefine the RLS {Point-Shift}\\ ${F}_{\\mbox{\\small{rls}}}$ which associates to\n$x\\in \\Phi$ the unique point $y\\in \\Phi$ such that $x$\ncomes next to $y$ in this total order. This {point-shift}{} is clearly bijective.\nHence the foil of $x$ is $\\{x\\}$. The unique connected component\nof this {point-shift}{} is thus\nof class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$.\nThe unique connected \ncomponent has two ends. Its foliation has the same order as ${\\Bbb Z}$.\nIt is not markable.\n\nNote that these two examples are bijective {point-shift} s. But there are cases \nof type $\\cal I/I$ which are not bijective.  \n\n\\subsubsection{Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$}\n\nHere are three examples illustrating that this class of {point-shift}{}s\ncan have either markable or non markable foliations.\n\n\\begin{prop}\nThe Next Row {point-shift}{} on the 2-dimensional Bernoulli grid \nwith $0<p<1$, has a single connected component of type \n$\\cal I/I$. Foils of this connected component are not markable.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThere is a single connected component and each foil consists\nof all points of the point process on a vertical line\n(Figure~\\ref{next.row.foils}). \nTherefore all foils are infinite and the connected component is of type \n$\\cal I/I$. If foils of this connected component were markable, \nthe partition of the point process into horizontal lines would form\na collection of infinite disjoint subsets of the Bernoulli grid.\nThe intersection of these subsets \nwith a some fixed foil is a finite non-empty inclusion, which contradicts\nTheorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{prop}\nThe Condenser {point-shift}{} on the Poisson point process in ${\\mathbb R}$ has \na single $\\cal I/I$ connected component and the foliation is markable. \n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nIt is easy to see that if $\\lambda_n$ is the intensity \nof points with the mark $m_c$ equal to $n$, where \n$m_c$ is defined in Example~\\ref{ssCEPM}, then $\\lambda_n$ tends \nto zero as $n$ tends to $\\infty$. Using this, one can conclude \nthat the condenser {point-shift}{} has a single connected component. \nEach foil consists of all points with the same mark $m_c$.\nThe foliation has the order of $\\mathbb N$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nHere are further examples of this class.\nThe authors in \\cite{FeLaTh04} prove that  the Strip {point-shift}{} $S$\non the Poisson point process in ${\\mathbb R}^2$, \nhas a single connected component which is one ended.\nTherefore this connected component evaporates under the action of ${f_{s}}$ \nand is of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$.\nOn a Poisson point process,\nthe expander point-shift also has a single connected component\nwhich evaporate under the action of the {point-shift}{}.\nThis component is of Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$.\n\n\\section{Partition Preserving Point-Maps}\n\\label{sec:pppm}\n\nIt is well-known that all bijective {point-shift} s preserve\nthe Palm probability of stationary point processes\nand that this property characterizes the Palm probabilities\nof stationary point processes \\cite{Me75}.\n\nThis section features\na fixed {point-shift}{} ${F}$ and considers the class \nof bijective {point-shift} s which preserve the two partitions\n${\\cal C}^{=}_{{{F}}} {\\cal C}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{{F}_{\\Phi}}$ and\n${\\cal L}^{=}_{{F}} {\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{{F}_{\\Phi}}$\nof a stationary point process $\\Phi$. \n\n\\subsection {Bijective {Point-Shift} s Preserving Components}\nLet $\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{}}^{F}:=\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{{F}}}(\\Phi)$ be the \n${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group as defined in Definition~\\ref{stable.group}.\nAs mentioned in Definition~\\ref{stable.group}, $\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{}}^{F}$\nis a subgroup\nof the symmetric group on the support\nof $\\Phi$.\n\n\\begin{prop}\n\\label{existence.f.orthogonalC}\nFor each {point-shift}{} ${F}$ and each stationary point process $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$,\nthere exists a ${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-dense element (see Definition~\\ref{stable.group}) of the\n${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group; i.e., there exists $H\\in\\Gamma_{{\\cal C}^{}}_{{}}^{F}$ such that \nfor all $x\\in \\Phi$,\n\\begin {equation*} {\\{{H}^i(x);i\\in{\\Bbb Z}\\}={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x).} \\end {equation*}\nThere is no uniqueness in general.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThe construction of $H$ is different for each of the three classes\nof components identified in Theorem \\ref{cardinality.components}.\nIn each case, the first step is the construction of a total order on the\npoints of $C$ which is flow-adapted and the second one\nis the definition of a dense and bijective {point-shift}{}\npreserving $C$.\n\nIf $C={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x)$ is of ${\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}$ class, then\nit is easy to create a total order which is translation\ninvariant on the points of $C$ as\nit is a finite set (e.g. using lexicographic order) with\npoints that can be numbered $0,1,\\ldots,n-1$ for some integer\n$n=n(x)\\ge 1$. A flow-adapted bijection $H$\npreserving $C$ is then easy to build by taking $H=M_n$\nwith $M_n(k)=k+1$ mod $n$.\n\nIf $C={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x)$ is of ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$ class, then,\nthe existence of a single bi-infinite path in $G^F(C)$ (see \nTheorem \\ref{cardinality.components}) and the\nfiniteness of the foils can be used to construct a total order.\nLet $\\{x_n\\}_{n\\in {\\Bbb Z}}$ be the bi-infinite path in question\nand let\n$L_n$ denote the foil of $x_n$.  \nSince $L_n$ is finite for all $n$, one can use the lexicographic\norder to create a total order between its points. The total order is\nthen obtained by saying that all points of $L_n$ have precedence over\nthose of $L_{n-1}$. This total order, which is that of ${\\Bbb Z}$,\nis flow-adapted.\nThe bijective {point-shift}{} is that associating to a point $x$ of $C$ \nits direct successor for this order. This {point-shift}{} will be referred\nto as the Bi-Infinite Path {Point-Shift}{} $B$, with associated {point-map}{} $b$.\nOn such a component, one takes $H=B$.\n\nIf $C={C^{\\Phi}_{[}}]{F}(x)$ is of ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ class, then\nthe construction uses a total order on the nodes\nof $G^{F}(C)$ known as RLS (Royal Line of Succession).\nThe latter order is based on two ingredients:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item A local (total) order\namong the sons of a given node in $G^{F}(C)$.\nThis can be done as follows: for a given point $x$ of $C$\nlet $B^{F}(x)=B^{F}_\\phi(x)$ be the set of its brothers; i.e.,  \n\\begin {equation*} {B^{F}(x):=\\{y\\in\\phi;{F}_\\phi(x)={F}_\\phi(y)\\}. } \\end {equation*}\nThe elements of $B^{F}(x)$ can then be ordered in a flow-adapted\nmanner using the lexicographic order of the Euclidean space.\n\\item The Depth First Search (DFS - see Appendix \\ref{AB})\npre-order on rooted trees.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe RLS order on a rooted tree is a total order\non a finite tree obtained by combining (1) and (2):\nDFS is used throughout and the sons of any given node are visited\nin the order prescribed by (1), with priority given to the\nolder son.\n\nIt is now explained how this also creates a total order on the nodes\nof $C$. For $x,y\\in C$, there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such\nthat ${F_\\phi}^m(x)={F_\\phi}^n(y)$. One says that $x\\geq_r y$ if $x$ has\nRLS priority over $y$ in the rooted tree of descendants\nof ${F}_\\phi^m(x)$. This tree is a.s. finite because  \nin the ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$ case, there is evaporation\nof $C$ by the {point-shift}{}, which this in turn implies that\nfor all points $z\\in \\phi$, the total number of descendents\nof $z$ is a.s. finite.\nThe DFS preordering on descendants of a node in a tree forms an\ninterval of this preordering. This implies that $\\geq_r$ \nis a well-defined order on $C$ and also that it orders elements of\n$C$ in the same linear order as that of an interval in ${\\Bbb Z}$.\nFurthermore, since $C$ is infinite,\nthis order on $C$ \ncannot have a greatest element or a least element.\nOtherwise the greatest and the least elements would be a finite\nflow-adapted subset of $C$ or the foil,\nwhich contradicts Theorem~\\ref{no.finite.invariant.collection}. \nTherefore the order on $C$ as well as its restriction to a foil\nis a linear order, similar to that of ${\\Bbb Z}$.\n\nOn such a components, one defined \n$H=R$ where $R$ denotes the RLS {point-shift}{},\nnamely the {point-shift}{} that associates to each point its \nsuccessor in the RLS order, which is bijective and translation \ninvariant.\n\\end{proof}\n \nLet $h$ denote the {point-map}{} of the {point-shift}{} $H$ defined\nin the last theorem.\nNotice that since $H$ is bijective, the dynamical system $({\\mathbf N}^0,\\theta_{h})$\npreserves ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Bijective {Point-Shift} s Preserving Foils}\nThe results of this subsection parallel those of the\nlast subsection, with an important refinement which is\nthat of \\emph{order preservation}.\n\nLet $\\Gamma_L^{F}:=\\Gamma_L^{F}(\\Phi)$ denote the set of all bijective\nand ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-preserving {point-shift} s.\nThis group, which is called the \\emph{${\\cal L}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group},\nis a subgroup of the ${\\cal C}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group. \n\nAs above, \nan element ${H}$ of the ${\\cal L}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group\nis said to be ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-dense if\n\\begin {equation*} {\\{{H}_\\phi^i(x);i\\in{\\Bbb Z}\\}={L^{\\phi}_{[}}]{F}(x).} \\end {equation*}\n\nEach ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-dense element ${H}$ of the ${\\cal L}^{$}_{{F}}-stable group\ninduces a total order $\\preceq_{H}$  on the elements of each infinite\nfoil of $C$ by \n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:preceq}\nx\\preceq_{H} {H}(x).\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"x\\preceq_{H}{H}(x).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><msub><mo>\u2aaf</mo><mi>H</mi></msub><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03653.tex", "nexttext": " \nwhich is a flow-adapted transport kernel.

$\\Phi_{{\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}}$ and\n$\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}}$ are empty, then each ${F}$-foil\nof $\\Phi$ has an infinite number of points (Corollary \\ref{cor26}),\nand the typical point\nhas a number of descendants which is a.s. finite (Corollary \\ref{cor25}) \nbut with infinite mean (Proposition \\ref{mn1}), and hence heavy tailed.\nSee Subsection \\ref{ssStrip} for an example.\n\n\\item\nIf $\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}}$ is empty, then each ${F}$-foil\nof $\\Phi$ has an a.s. finite number of points \n(Theorem \\ref{cardinality.components});\nthe typical point has descendants of all orders with a positive probability\\footnote{With probability 1 iff ${F}$ is bijective.}\n(Corollary \\ref{cor25}),\nand hence an infinite number of descendants. However,\nthe expected number of descendants of order $n$ \ndoes not diverge in mean (Corollary \\ref{cor28}) as $n$ tends to infinity.\nIf in addition $\\Phi_{{\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}}$ is empty, then\nthe set of descendants of the typical point\nlooks like a ``finite star with a loop at the center''.\nSee Subsection \\ref{ssMnn} for an example.\nIf in place $\\Phi_{{\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}}$ is empty, then\nthe set of descendants of the typical point is either finite or\nlooks like an ``infinite path with finite trees attached to it''.\nThe points in this infinite path\nconstitute a sub-stationary point process.\nThis point process always has a\npositive intensity.\n(For instance, for the RLS {point-shift}{} on the Poisson\npoint process in ${\\mathbb R}^2$, this is the\nwhole point process. There exist cases where \n$F$ is not bijective and the connected components are \nof type $\\cal I/F$ and hence such that this \nsub-point process is not the whole point process.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Foil Intensities} \nThis subsection is focused on the intensity of the ${F}$-foils.\nFrom Proposition \\ref{thdic}, either all foils of a markable component are \nflow-adapted point processes, or none of them are.\nThe notion of intensity only makes sense in the former case.\nThe notion of {\\em relative intensity} defined in the next subsection allows\none to discuss the ``density'' of foils in whole generality, namely\nregardless of the above dichotomy.\n\n\\subsubsection{Relative Intensities}\nBelow, when considering a component\nof Class~${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$, it is assumed that\n${{F}_\\bot}$ is an ${\\cal L}^{\\Phi}_{[}]{F}$-dense \nelement of the ${F}$-stable group and that\n$\\preceq_{{{F}_\\bot}}$ is ${F}$-compatible.\n\n\nLet ${f}_\\bot$ denote the {point-map}{} of ${{F}_\\bot}$ and let ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$\ndenote its related shift on ${\\mathbf N}^0$. Equations\n(\\ref{fgfol}) and (\\ref{orthogonal.distance}) give that for ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$-almost\nall $\\phi\\in{\\mathbf N}^0$, \n\\begin {equation} {\\label{orthogonal.fg}{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi=\\theta_{{{F}_\\bot}^n(\\phi,0)}\\phi.} \\end {equation}\nHence if $\\phi\\sim_{\\theta_{{f}}} \\psi$,  with abuse of notation,\none can define ${\\Delta}(\\phi,\\psi)$ as the unique integer $n$ such that\n${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi=\\psi$.\n\n\nConsider the dynamical system $({\\mathbf N}^0,\\theta_{{f_\\bot}})$.\nThe fact that ${{F}_\\bot}$ is bijective implies that $\\theta_{{f_\\bot}}$\npreserves ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$. \n\n\\begin{thm}\n\\label{existence.of.relative.intensity}\nLet $(\\Phi,{\\mathbb P})$ be a stationary point process, ${F}$\nbe an arbitrary {point-shift}{} and  ${{F}_\\bot}$ and ${\\Delta}$ \nbe as in Definition~\\ref{f.orthogonal}.\nThen, for ${\\cal P}_0$ almost-all realizations $\\phi$, the limit \n\\begin {equation} {\\label{relative.intensity}\\lambda_+(\\phi):= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{{\\Delta}\\left({F_\\phi}(0),{F_\\phi}\\circ{{F}_\\bot}^n(0)\\right)}{{\\Delta}\\left( 0,{{F}_\\bot}^n(0)\\right)}} \\end {equation}\nexists, is positive and\nin $L_1({\\cal P}_0)$.\nIn addition, $\\lambda_+(\\phi)$\nis a function of the foil of $0$ only; i.e., if\n$0\\sim_{F} x$,  $\\lambda_+(\\theta_x\\phi)=\\lambda_+(\\phi)$ and \n$\\lambda_+$ is  independent\nof the choice ${{F}_\\bot}$ as far as it satisfies\nthe properties in Proposition~\\ref{existence.f.orthogonal}.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{rem}\nThe existence of the non-degenerate limit in (\\ref{relative.intensity})\ncan be seen as a proof of the fact that all foils of a connected\ncomponents have the ``same dimension''. This fact justifies the\nuse of the term ``foliation'' within this context (see e.g. \\cite{An01}).\n\\end{rem}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $x$ is in a connected component of $G^{F}(\\phi)$ which is \n${\\mathcal F}/{\\mathcal F}$ or\n${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal F}$, all statements \nfollow from finiteness of the foils.\nHence assume $C(0)$ is ${\\mathcal I}/{\\mathcal I}$. \nHence it is sufficient to show that, for ${\\cal P}_0$ almost\nall $\\phi$, the  limit  \n\\begin {equation} {\\label{relative.intensity.n0}\\lambda_+(\\phi)= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{{\\Delta}\\left({\\theta_{{f}}} \\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)} {{\\Delta}\\left( \\phi,{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)},} \\end {equation}\nexists and is positive, finite and constant on the\nfoil ${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$ provided the latter is infinite.\nLet $ {\\Delta}_+(\\phi):= {\\Delta}({\\theta_{{f}}}\\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}\\phi)$.\nNow consider the following mass transport:\n\\begin {equation*} {w(\\phi,x,y)= \\begin{cases} 1 & y\\in {L^{+}_{[}}]{F}(x) \\text{ and } 0  {\\le} {\\Delta}({F}_\\phi(x),y)  {<} {\\Delta}({F}_\\phi(x), {F}_\\phi\\circ{{F}_\\bot}(x))\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} } \\end {equation*}\nOne has, for all points $x,y\\in\\phi$, $w^-(y)\\leq 1$\nand $w_+(x)= {\\Delta}_+ (\\theta_x\\phi)$. Therefore\n\\begin {equation*} {{{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}\\left[ {\\Delta}_{+}\\right] = {{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}\\left[ w^+(0)\\right] = {{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}\\left[ w^-(0)\\right]\\leq 1.} \\end {equation*} \nSince  the denominator in (\\ref{relative.intensity.n0}) is equal to $n$, \none has \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{{\\Delta}\\left({\\theta_{{f}}}\\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)}{{\\Delta}\\left( \\phi,{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^n\\phi\\right)}\n&=&\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac 1n {\\sum_{i=1}^n {\\Delta}\\left({\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^{i-1}\\phi,{\\theta_{{f}}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}\\circ{\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^{i-1}\\phi\\right)}\\\\\n&=& \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac 1n {\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  {\\Delta}_+ \\left({\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}^{i}\\phi\\right)}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nSince ${{F}_\\bot}$ is ${\\mathbb P}$-{almost surely}{} bijective, ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$ is ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$-invariant.\nTherefore if one denotes by $\\cal I$\n the invariant $\\sigma$-field of ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$,\n  the finiteness of ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[ {\\Delta}_+]$ implies that the last\nlimit exists for ${{\\mathbb P}_\\Phi}$-almost all $\\phi$ and\nit is equal to ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[ {\\Delta}_+|{\\cal I}]$, which is finite\nand invariant under the action of ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$;\ni.e., it is a function of ${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$. \n\nTo prove that $\\lambda_+(\\phi)$ is a.s. positive, note that, if $Y$\nis the event of being the youngest son of the family, then\n$\\tilde {\\Delta}\\geq {\\mathbf 1}_Y$. Hence if, with positive probability, \n$\\lambda_+(\\phi)=0$, this means that, with positive probability,\n${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[{\\mathbf 1}_Y|{\\cal I}]$ is zero. But since ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}$ is ${\\theta_{{f}_\\bot}}$-invariant,\nthis means that, with positive probability, there is no youngest son\non the foil of ${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$, which means that all points of\n${L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi)$ are brothers. \nSince $C^{\\theta_{{f}}}(\\phi)$ is infinite, this contradicts the a.s.\nfiniteness of $d_1({F}_\\phi(0))$.\n\nFinally to prove that $\\lambda_+(\\phi)$ is independent of the choice of ${{F}_\\bot}$,\nit is sufficient to show that ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[{\\Delta_+}|{\\cal I}]$ depends only on $f$.\nTo do so, it is enough to prove that\nfor all $A\\in {\\cal I}$, ${{\\mathbb E}_\\Phi}[{\\Delta_+}{\\mathbf 1}_{A}]$ depends only on $f$.\nSince $A\\in{\\cal I}$, with abuse of notation, one has \n${\\mathbf 1}_A(\\phi) = {\\mathbf 1}_A({L^{(}_{{\\theta_{{f}}}}}\\phi))$.\nLet\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nA_+ &=&\\{{\\theta_{{f}}} \\phi; \\phi\\in A\\},\\\\\n{L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(A) &=& \\{\\phi\\in{\\mathbf N}^0;{L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(\\phi)\\neq\\emptyset \\text{ and } {L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(\\phi)\\in A \\}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nIt is easy to see that ${L^{-}_{[}}]{\\theta_{{f}}}(A)\\in{\\cal I}$.
