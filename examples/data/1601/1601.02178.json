magnetic field comparable to the typical scale of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) may drastically modify hadron properties.\nSuch an intense field may appear in heavy-ion collision experiments: Non-central collision between two charged nuclei can produce a strong magnetic field of which strength is estimated to reach $|eB| \\sim m_\\pi^2 \\sim 0.02 \\, \\mathrm{GeV^2}$ at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and $|eB| \\sim 15 m_\\pi^2 \\sim 0.3 \\, \\mathrm{GeV^2}$ at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \\cite{Kharzeev:2007jp,Skokov:2009qp}.\nFurthermore, lattice QCD simulations provide useful method to study hadron properties in strong magnetic fields \\cite{Bali:2011qj, Hidaka:2012mz, Luschevskaya:2014lga}.\n\nFor light mesons (with only up, down and strange quarks) in a magnetic field, many studies including $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory \\cite{Bali:2011qj, Hidaka:2012mz, Luschevskaya:2014lga} have been performed.\nIn particular, influence of the deformation of the QCD vacuum (so-called the magnetic catalysis) on hadron properties is one of the interesting topics.\nProperties of hadrons with heavy quarks (charm or bottom) in a magnetic field were also investigated by various approaches including potential models \\cite{Machado:2013rta,Alford:2013jva,Bonati:2015dka}, QCD sum rules \\cite{Machado:2013yaa,Cho:2014exa,Cho:2014loa,Gubler:2015qok} and AdS/QCD \\cite{Dudal:2014jfa}.\nThese works, however, have focused only to the ground-state hadrons. \n\nThe main purpose of this Letter is to investigate the deformation of the wave functions and corresponding energy levels for both ground and excited states of charmonia in a constant magnetic field, on the basis of the non-relativistic quark model.\nIn such a model, there are two physical effects which lead to the change of hadronic properties: (i) {\\it mixing between different spin states} by the $-\\bm{\\mu}_i \\cdot \\bm{B}$ term and (ii) {\\it modification of quark kinetic energy} by the $\\bm{B} \\times \\bm{r}$ term \\footnote{\nRecently, the anisotropy of a confinement potential deformed by a magnetic field was evaluated by lattice QCD \\cite{Bonati:2014ksa} and its correction in the potential model for quarkonia was investigated in Ref.~\\cite{Bonati:2015dka}}.\n\nWe note here that it is not technically easy to solve the two-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with confining potential under strong magnetic field and to extract the anisotropic wave functions for ground and excited states simultaneously.\nThe previous attempt \\cite{Alford:2013jva} by using the finite differential time domain (FDTD) method is so far limited only to the ground state. \n\nIn this Letter, we propose an approach based on a variational method, which we call cylindrical Gaussian expansion method (CGEM).\nThis method is an extension from the conventional Gaussian expansion method (GEM) \\cite{Kamimura:1988zz,Hiyama:2003cu}.\nThe CGEM has the following nice properties: (i) It respects the symmetry of the Hamiltonian under constant magnetic field, (ii) it can deal fully with higher excited states and (iii) it reduces a computational cost substantially.\n\n\\paragraph{Formalism} \\label{Sec_Formalism}\nWe start with the same non-relativistic two-body Hamiltonian as Ref.~\\cite{Alford:2013jva},\n\n", "index": 1, "text":

``transverse\" components $| 1 \\pm1 \\rangle$ of the triplet cannot mix with other states since the couplings between the quark magnetic moments and the magnetic field are completely canceled between the quark and the anti-quark.\nTo take into account the off-diagonal components of the matrix elements, Eq.~(\\ref{mat_ele}), we have to solve a {\\it coupled-channel} Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n\n\\paragraph{Cylindrical Gaussian expansion method (CGEM)}\nIn order to solve the two-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, we use the GEM based on the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principal, which is a powerful tool in nuclear and atomic physics \\cite{Kamimura:1988zz,Hiyama:2003cu}. \nAccording to the conventional GEM, in a system with the spherical symmetry, the radial wave function of a bound state can be expanded by Gaussian bases: $\\sum_n C_n e^{-\\alpha_n r^2}$ in the spherical coordinate $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$, where $C_n$ and $\\alpha_n$ are the normalized expansion coefficient and the variational parameter (or range parameter), respectively.\nOn the other hand, the present system in the magnetic field does not have the spherical symmetry.\nIn this case, a wave function should be expanded individually by the Gaussian basis on the transverse plane, $e^{- \\beta_n \\rho^2}$, and that along the longitudinal axis, $e^{- \\gamma_n z^2}$, in the cylindrical coordinate $(\\rho,z,\\phi)$.\nSuch bases are applied to atomic systems in a magnetic field (e.g. Ref.~\\cite{Becken:2001}).\n\nThe trial wave function for $l_z=0$ is given as follows:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&& \\Psi (\\rho,z,\\phi) = \\sum_{n=1}^N C_n \\Phi_n (\\rho,z,\\phi), \\\\\n&& \\Phi_n (\\rho,z,\\phi) = N_n e^{- \\beta_n \\rho^2} e^{- \\gamma_n z^2},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $N$ and $C_n$ are the number of basis functions and the expansion coefficients.\n$N_n$ is the normalization constant defined by $ \\langle \\Phi_n| \\Phi_n \\rangle =1$.\n$\\beta_n$ and $\\gamma_n$ are Gaussian range parameters for $\\rho$ and $z$ directions, respectively.\nIt is empirically known that the best set of the range parameters, $\\beta_1 \\cdots \\beta_N$ and $\\gamma_1 \\cdots \\gamma_N$, are the geometric progressions: $\\beta_n = 1/\\rho_n^2$ with $\\rho_n = \\rho_1 b^{n-1}$ and $\\gamma_n = 1/z_n^2$ with $z_n = z_1 c^{n-1}$.\nHere, the four parameters, $\\rho_1$, $\\rho_N$, $z_1$ and $z_N$, will be optimized as the energy eigenvalue is minimized.\nWe checked the applicability of our numerical code by comparing our variational result with the analytic solution of the 3--dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator \\cite{Yoshida;prog}.\n\nHere, we set the parameters of our constituent quark model.\nFor parameters in charmonium systems, the charm-quark kinetic mass $m_c=1.7840 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, the Coulomb parameter $A=0.713$ and the string tension $\\sqrt{\\sigma} = 0.402 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$ are determined from the equal-time $Q\\bar{Q}$ Bethe-Salpeter amplitude in lattice QCD \\cite{Kawanai:2015tga}.\nFor the spin-dependent potential given as $ \\alpha \\exp{(-\\Lambda r^2)}$, we adopt $\\Lambda=1.020 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ obtained from lattice QCD \\cite{Kawanai:2011jt} by fitting a charmonium potential.\nThe remaining parameters, $\\alpha=0.4778 \\, \\rm{GeV}$ and $C=-0.5693 \\, \\rm{GeV}$, are chosen to reproduce the experimental values of the masses of the ground states of $\\eta_c$ and $J/\\psi$.\nWe checked that these parameters can reproduce the masses of the ground and excited states of the charmonium well.\n\n\\paragraph{Results}\nWe investigate the region of the magnetic field up to $eB=10 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ to enable us to compare our results with future lattice QCD simulations, although the maximum of magnetic fields produced by heavy-ion collisions at LHC is $eB \\sim 0.3 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$.\nTransverse $J/\\psi$ is not mixed with other spin eigenstates, so that we can obtain the masses and the wave functions by solving the single-channel Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\nThe results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{charmonia_T}.\nIn weak magnetic fields, the masses of the ground and excited states increase gradually.\nNote that our result of the ground state in the weak magnetic fields agrees with that of Refs.~\\cite{Alford:2013jva,Bonati:2015dka} obtained by the FDTD method.\nIn strong magnetic fields, the masses are linearly raised, which is consistent with the energy shift by the lowest Landau levels of the constituent quarks inside the hadron.\nIt is interesting that the mass shift of the excited $\\psi(2S)$ state is larger than that of the ground state.\nThe reason is that the size of the wave function of an excited state is larger than that of the corresponding ground state, so that the expectation value of the $\\rho^2$ term in Eq.~(\\ref{H_rel2}) is also enhanced.\n\nMoreover, the shape of the wave function is significantly modified.\nIn the ground state, the wave function on the $\\rho$-plane is squeezed and the overall shape becomes cigar-shaped.\nThe wave function of the excited state with one spherical node in vacuum changes to the shape with one node along the $z$-direction.\nThis behavior implies that the excitation in the $\\rho$-plane is removed by the $\\rho^2$ term while that in the $z$-direction remains.\n\nThe results of $\\eta_c$ and longitudinal $J/\\psi$ are shown in Fig.~\\ref{charmonia_L}.\nThese states are mixed with each other by $-\\bm{\\mu}_i \\cdot \\bm{B}$ term in Eq.~(\\ref{H_rel2}), so that their masses change.\nFor the {\\it first} state starting from $\\eta_c(1S)$ at $eB=0$, the mixing partners are all excited states ($\\psi(2S)$, $\\psi(3S)$ ...) as well as the ground state $J/\\psi$.\n$\\eta_c(1S)$ predominantly mixes with $J/\\psi$ and its mass decreases gradually with increasing magnetic field.\nThe {\\it second} state starting from $J/\\psi$ at $eB=0$ is also mixed with $\\eta_c(1S)$ in the weak magnetic fields.\nAs the magnetic field becomes larger, this state is contaminated by the excited states of $\\eta_c$ and its mass approaches the third state like $\\eta_c(2S)$ at $eB=1.1 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$.\nAfter that, the mass decreases slowly, where the wave function behaves as $2S$ state with one node.\nAs with the case of transverse $J/\\psi$, the mass shifts of the first and second states in the weak magnetic fields are consistent with those of Refs.~\\cite{Alford:2013jva,Bonati:2015dka}.\n\nIt is important to note that the mass shifts of the excited states in a weak magnetic field are more sensitive to $eB$ than that of the ground state.\nThe reason is that the hyperfine splitting between the spin partners in vacuum is narrower so that their mixing in a magnetic field becomes stronger.\nSuch a behavior can also be inferred from a simplified two-level model as discussed in Refs.~\\cite{Alford:2013jva,Cho:2014exa,Cho:2014loa}.\nFor instance, the mass shifts of $\\eta_c$, $J/\\psi$, $\\eta_c(2S)$ and $\\psi(2S)$ at $eB=0.1 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ are $-9.9$, $+12.4$, $-16.6$ and $+28.8 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively.\nThus the mixing in a weak magnetic field is consistent with the behavior of the two-level system, while the behaviors in intermediate magnetic fields are more complicated.\nThe {\\it third} state starting from $\\eta_c(2S)$ approaches the second one like $J/\\psi$ and, after that, the fourth one like $\\eta_c(3S)$ at $eB=1.8 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$.\nFinally, similar behaviors are found in {\\it fourth} state starting from $\\psi(2S)$, which approaches the fifth state like $\\eta_c(3S)$, the third state like $J/\\psi$ and the fifth state like $\\eta_c(4S)$.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{eta_c2S_RMS}, the root-mean square (RMS) radii of the wave function of the third state are shown.\nWe show radii defined by $\\sqrt{\\langle \\rho^2 \\rangle} \\equiv \\sqrt{(3/2) \\langle \\Psi | \\rho^2 |\\Psi \\rangle}$ and $\\sqrt{\\langle z^2 \\rangle} \\equiv \\sqrt{ 3 \\langle \\Psi | z^2 |\\Psi \\rangle}$ in the $\\rho$- and $z$- directions, respectively.\nThese agree with the usual spherical RMS radius $\\sqrt{\\langle r^2 \\rangle} $ in vacuum: $\\sqrt{\\langle r^2 \\rangle}_{B=0} = \\sqrt{\\langle \\rho^2 \\rangle}_{B=0} = \\sqrt{\\langle z^2 \\rangle}_{B=0}$.\nIn this figure, the decrease of $\\sqrt{\\langle \\rho^2 \\rangle}$ and the increase of $\\sqrt{\\langle z^2 \\rangle}$ up to $eB=1.1 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ correspond to the shrinkage on the $\\rho$-plane and the expansion in the $z$-direction for the wave function like $\\eta_c(2S)$, respectively, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{charmonia_L}.\nFurthermore, the plateaus of $\\sqrt{\\langle z^2 \\rangle}$ at $1.1<eB<1.8 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and at $eB > 1.8 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ are corresponding to the wave functions like $J/\\psi$ and $\\eta_c(3S)$, respectively.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb!]\n  \\begin{center}\n

$\\Upsilon(2S)$, $\\eta_b(3S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ below the threshold.\nTheir magnetic behaviors are similar to those of charmonia.\nSince bottom quarks are heavier than charm quarks, the kinetic energies of the constituent quarks inside a hadron are suppressed and the sizes of the wave functions are smaller than those of charmonia.\nAs a result, the mass shifts and wave functions of bottomonia are less sensitive to a magnetic field than those of charmonia.\nFurthermore, the magnetic moment is suppressed by the bottom quark mass, so that the mixing effect becomes also smaller. \nFor instance, longitudinal $\\Upsilon(1S)$ approaches $\\eta_b(2S)$ at about $eB=5.5 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ \\cite{Yoshida;prog}.\n\nOur results in the weak magnetic fields provide various implications to the observables such as $\\eta_c + \\gamma \\to J/\\psi$ transition rate \\cite{Yang:2011cz}, production cross section of quarkonia \\cite{Machado:2013rta}, anisotropic production \\cite{Guo:2015nsa} and quarkonium melting \\cite{Marasinghe:2011bt,Dudal:2014jfa} in a magnetic field induced by heavy-ion collisions.\nIn particular, the dilepton spectra from vector quarkonia can shift and split between the transverse and longitudinal components \\cite{Alford:2013jva,Filip:2013xza}.\nAs we discussed, the properties of the excited states are expected to be a sensitive probe of a magnetic field.\nFor instance, the mass shifts of $J/\\psi_{|1\\pm 1 \\rangle}$, $\\psi(2S)_{|1\\pm 1 \\rangle}$, $J/\\psi_{|10 \\rangle}$ and $\\psi(2S)_{|10 \\rangle}$ at $eB=0.3 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ are 12.4, 50.8, 79.7 and $121.5 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively.\nThe mass splitting between the transverse and longitudinal components at $eB=0.3 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ are $67.3 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$ and $70.7 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$ for $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$, respectively.\nFurthermore, our predictions in the strong magnetic fields can be numerically confirmed by future lattice QCD simulations.\n\n\\paragraph{Conclusion and outlook} \\label{Sec_Conclusion and outlook}\nWe investigated the static properties of quarkonia in homogeneous magnetic fields.\nOur approach based on CGEM can deal fully with the coupled channel of the mixing between the spin-0 and spin-1 states, so that the resultant mass shifts include the mixing not only with the nearest spin partner but also with the other ground and excited states.\nMoreover, the deformations of the wave functions in both the ground and excited states were discussed.\nSome implications of our results to the experimental observables in RHIC and LHC were discussed.\nTo improve our results more quantitatively, we need to introduce relativistic corrections, an anisotropic confinement potential \\cite{Bonati:2014ksa,Rougemont:2014efa,Bonati:2015dka} and modifications of the continuum threshold in the magnetic field.\nIt is an interesting future problem to extend our method into not only other neutral hadron systems such as $P$-wave mesons and baryons in a magnetic field, but also non-relativistic bound states in atomic, molecular and nuclear few-body systems.\nThe investigations of the magnetic behaviors of such systems may help us to gain comprehensive insight into quantum many-body systems under strong magnetic field.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThe authors thank Tetsuo

$\\bm{B} =(0,0,B) $, $\\bm{B} \\times \\bm{r} = B(-y,x,0)$ and $\\bm{K} =(K_x,K_y,0) $, the Hamiltonian is reduced to \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_\\mathrm{rel} &=& \\frac{\\bm{K}^2}{2M}

along the $z$-axis.\n\nFor the potential term, we choose the Cornell potential \\cite{Eichten:1974af} with a spin-spin interaction:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV(r) &=& \\sigma r - \\frac{A}{r} + \\alpha (\\bm{S}_1 \\cdot \\bm{S}_2)  e^{- \\Lambda r^2} + C \\nonumber\\\\\n&=& \\sigma \\sqrt{\\rho^2 + z^2} -\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{\\rho^2 + z^2}} + \\alpha (\\bm{S}_1 \\cdot \\bm{S}_2) e^{- \\Lambda (\\rho^2 + z^2)} \\nonumber\\\\\n&& + C,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\bm{S}_1 \\cdot \\bm{S}_2 = -3/4$ and $1/4$ for the spin singlet and triplet, respectively.\nHere, we adopted the conventional Gaussian form for the spin-spin interaction so that we have analytic expressions of the matrix elements.\n\nLet us now consider the contribution of the spin mixing induced by the term $-\\bm{\\mu}_i \\cdot \\bm{B}$ \\cite{Machado:2013rta,Alford:2013jva}, where the quark magnetic moment is given by $\\bm{\\mu}_i = g q_i \\bm{S}_i/2m_i$ with the Land$\\acute{\\mathrm{e}}$ $g$-factor assumed to be $g=2$.\nThe
