In \\cite{Jung14}, Jung proved that closed curves of constant \nnonzero constant geodesic curvature in a hyperbolic surface do not lie in the nodal set,\nand, moreover, he obtained a bound on the number of intersections in terms of the \neigenvalue.\\footnote{Only closed horocycles \nand boundaries of disks were considered in \\cite{Jung14}, \nbut the methods also apply to curves\nconsisting of points that are equidistant to a closed geodesic.} \n\nOn the other hand, it is well-known that closed curves of zero geodesic \ncurvature---geodesics---may lie the zero level set of an eigenfunction. \nIndeed, if a closed Riemannian manifold admits a reflection self-isometry $r$, \nthen the fixed point set of $r$ is totally geodesic and infinitely many \neigenfunctions vanish on the fixed point set.  \n\nLet $N(X)$ denote the cardinality of the collection of totally geodesic immersed \nhypersurfaces $M$ in $X$ such that there exists a Laplace eigenfunction  ${\\varphi}$ \nso that ${\\varphi}|_M= 0$ or $\\nabla {\\varphi}|_M =0$. \n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{thm:main}\n\nIf $X$ is a finite volume hyperbolic manifold, then $N(X)$ is finite.  \n\n\n\n\\end{thm}\n\nIn contrast, if $X$ is the standard sphere or flat torus, then \n$N(X)$ is the first uncountable ordinal. Indeed, if the isometry group of a \ncompact Riemannian manifold contains a one parameter subgroup $K$\nand a reflection that does not commute with $K$, then for each $k \\in K$\nthe fixed point set of $k \\circ r \\circ k^{-1}$ is a totally geodesic\nhypersurface that belongs to the nodal set of an eigenfunction. \n\nIn \\S \\ref{section:main-thm-proof}, we prove Theorem \\ref{thm:main}.\nWe use the Schwarz reflection principle to show that $N(X)$ is bounded above \nby the number, $N'(X)$, of totally geodesic \nimmersed hypersurfaces $M$ such that there exists an orbifold covering \n$p: X \\to Y$ such that $p(M)$ lies in the boundary of $Y$. \nWe then use the theory of lattices in Lie groups to show that $N'(X)$ is finite. \nIn \\S \\ref{section:surface}, we show that if $X$ is a surface, then \n$N'(X)$ can be bounded in terms\nthe area of $X$.  \nIn \\S \\ref{ex:figure-eight}, we construct some nodal sets on hyperbolic\nsurfaces that do not belong to the fixed point set of a reflection isometry. \nIn \\S \\ref{section:questions}, we raise some questions.\n\nWe thank Kevin Pilgrim and Dylan Thurston for enlightening discussion. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{The proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:main}}  \\label{section:main-thm-proof}\n\nRecall that a hyperbolic manifold is a quotient of hyperbolic space \n${\\mathbf H}^n$ by a torsion-free discrete subgroup of the Lie group, ${\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$, \nself-isometries of ${\\mathbf H}^n$. More generally, we will consider quotients by \ndiscrete subgroups of ${\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$ that include finite order \nelements including reflections. \n\nThe group ${\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$ acts on functions\n$f: {\\mathbf H}^n \\to {\\mathbb R}$ by precomposition: $(f,g) \\mapsto f \\circ g$.\nLet $\\Gamma_f \\subset {\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$ denote\nthe set of $g \\in {\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$ so that either $f \\circ g =f$ or $f \\circ g = -f$.\nIf $f$ is continuous, then $\\Gamma_f$ is closed.\n\n\\begin{lem}  \\label{lem:reflection}\n\nIf $f$ is a nonconstant continuous function such that\n$\\Gamma_f$ contains a cofinite discrete subgroup of ${\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$,\nthen $\\Gamma_f$ is also discrete.\n\n\\end{lem}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\nSuppose to the contrary that $\\Gamma_f$ is not discrete. Then since it is a closed\nsubgroup of a Lie group, it contains a one-parameter subgroup $G$.\nSince $\\Gamma$ is cofinite, its limit set in the ideal boundary of ${\\mathbf H}^n$ is dense.\nIt follows that the group generated by the conjugates $\\gamma G \\gamma^{-1} \\neq G$, \n$\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, act transitively on ${\\mathbf H}^n$. In particular, $\\Gamma_f$ acts \ntransitively  and so $f$ is constant.\n\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nIf $f: {\\mathbf H}^n \\to {\\mathbb R}$ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian that\nvanishes on a totally geodesic hypersurface $M \\subset {\\mathbf H}^n$, \nthen the reflection $r_{M} \\in {\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$\nabout $M$ belongs to $\\Gamma_f$. This is a well-known variant\nof the Schwarz reflection principle. Here is a sketch of the proof:\nSince the Laplacian commutes with the action by isometries, the \nfunction $f \\circ r_{M}$\nis an eigenfunction of $\\Delta$ with the same eigenvalue. Define $h: {\\mathbf H}^n \\to {\\mathbb R}$\nby setting $h$ equal to $f$ on one component of ${\\mathbf H}^n - M$ and equal to\n$-f \\circ r_M$ on the other component.\nBecause both $f$ and $-f \\circ r_M$ vanish on $M$,\nthe function $h$ belongs to the first Sobolev space and $h$ is a weak solution to\nthe Laplace eigenvalue problem. A well-known argument using elliptic regularity\ngives that $h$ is a strong solution. But $f$ and $h$ agree on an open set\nand hence $f = h$ and $f= -f \\circ r_M$.  A similar argument shows that if \nthe gradient of an eigenfunction  $f$ vanishes on $M$, then $f \\circ r_M = f$. \n\n\n\n\nGiven a totally geodesic hypersurface $M \\subset {\\mathbf H}^n/\\Gamma$,\nlet $\\widetilde{M}$ denote a lift to ${\\mathbf H}^n$. Since each lift differs by an element \nof $\\Gamma$, the group $\\Gamma(M)$ generated by $\\Gamma$ and $r_{\\widetilde{M}}$ \ndoes not depend on the lift of $M$.   \n\nSuppose that a nonconstant eigenfunction $f$ (or its gradient) vanishes on a totally \ngeodesic immersed hypersurface $M$. \nSince ${\\widetilde{f}}$ is nonconstant,  Lemma \\ref{lem:reflection} implies \nthat $\\Gamma_{{\\widetilde{f}}}$ is discrete and hence so is $\\Gamma(M)$. \nTherefore, $N(X)$ is at most the number, $N'(X)$, of totally geodesic immersed hypersurfaces\n$M$ such that $\\Gamma(M)$ is discrete. \n\nWe will show that $N'(X)$ is finite in two steps. First, we will bound the \nnumber, $N^*(X)$, of distinct discrete groups $\\Gamma(M)$\nthat arise from totally geodesic immersed hypersufaces $M \\subset X$.\nThen we will show that only finitely many hypersurfaces $M$\ndetermine the same group $\\Gamma(M)$. \n \n\n\\begin{thm} \\label{thm:discrete-finite}\n\nFor each $V>0$\nthere exists a constant $C_V$ such that if $X$ is a (complete) hyperbolic manifold\nwith volume less than $C_V$, then $N^*(X) < C_V$.\\footnote{\n\nBy consulting the literature, one can obtain explicit constants $C_V$\n \\cite{Lubotzky-Segal} \\cite{BGLAS}.} \n\n\\end{thm}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\nAs above, let $\\Gamma$ be a discrete group such that $X = {\\mathbf H}^n/\\Gamma$ \nand let $r=r_{{\\widetilde{M}}}$ be the reflection in a lift of a totally\ngeodesic immersed hypersurface $M$. We suppose that $\\Gamma(M)=\\langle \\Gamma, r\\rangle$\nis discrete. Both $\\Gamma$ and $r \\Gamma r^{-1}$ are finite index in \n$\\Gamma(M) =\\langle \\Gamma, r\\rangle$, and hence $\\Gamma \\cap r\\Gamma r^{-1}$\nis finite index in both $\\Gamma$ and $r \\Gamma r^{-1}$. That is, \n$r$ lies in the commensurator, ${\\rm Comm}(\\Gamma)$, of $\\Gamma$\n\\cite{Maclachlan-Reid}. \n\nLet  $d:=[{\\rm Comm}(\\Gamma): \\Gamma]$. If $d$ is finite, then\nthe number of subgroups of ${\\rm Comm}(\\Gamma)$ of index at most $d$\nis finite, and, in particular, $N^*(X)$ is finite.  \n\nIf $d$ is not finite then, by a well-known theorem of Margulis \\cite{Maclachlan-Reid},  \n$\\Gamma$ is arithmetic, and therefore each $\\Gamma(M)$ is arithmetic.\nThere are at most finitely many arithmetic lattices whose\ncovolume is bounded from above by ${\\rm Vol}(X)$ \\cite{Maclachlan-Reid}, \nand thus the number of $\\Gamma(M)$ is bounded in terms of ${\\rm Vol}(X)$.\n\nFinally, we consider the dependence of $N^*(X)$ on the volume of $X$\nwhen $d$ is finite. \nBy a result of Gelander  \\cite{Gelander11},\nthere is a constant $K_n>0$ such that for each discrete subgroup \n$\\Gamma' \\subset {\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$ the number of generators \nof $\\Gamma'$ is at most $K_n \\cdot {\\rm Covol}(\\Gamma')$. \nIn particular, since $\\Gamma'$ has at least one generator, \nthe covolume of $\\Gamma'$ is at least $1/K_n$. \n\nIf $d$ is finite, then ${\\rm Vol}(X) = d \\cdot {\\rm Covol}({\\rm Comm}(\\Gamma))\n   \\geq d \\cdot (1/K_n)$, and the group ${\\rm Comm}(\\Gamma)$ is generated\nby at most $K_n \\cdot {\\rm Vol}(X)$ elements. The number of subgroups of index at most $d$ \nin a group generated by $k$ elements is at most the number of subgroups \nof index at most $d$ in the free group on $k$ generators. \nTherefore we have a bound on $N^*(X)$ in terms of ${\\rm Vol}(X)$ when $d$ is finite. \n\n\\end{proof}\n \nWe complete the proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:main} with the following. \n\n\\begin{prop}\n\n\nIf $\\Gamma$ is a cofinite discrete subgroup of ${\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^n)$ and $\\Gamma^* \\supset \\Gamma$ is discrete, \nthen only finitely many totally geodesic immersed hypersurfaces $M \\subset {\\mathbf H}^n/\\Gamma$ \nsatisfy $\\Gamma(M) = \\Gamma^*$.  \n\n\\end{prop}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\nFirst we note that there is a compact subset $K \\subset {\\mathbf H}^n/\\Gamma$ such that \neach totally geodesic immersed submanifold $M \\subset  {\\mathbf H}^n/\\Gamma$ must intersect $K$.  \nIndeed, let $K$ be the complement of a union of disjoint horoball neighborhoods of the cusps.\nAny lift to ${\\mathbf H}^n$ of a geodesic on $M$ joins two distinct points on the ideal boundary.\nIf an endpoint does lie at the end of a cusp, then it enters $K$ and if \nboth endpoints lie in the closure of horoballs, they lie in distinct horoballs,\nand hence must enter $K$. \n\nSuppose that $M_k$ is an infinite sequence of distinct \ntotally geodesic immersed hypersurfaces\nwith $\\Gamma(M_k)= \\Gamma^*$ for each $k$. Since each $M_k$ intersects $K$, \nthere exists an orthonormal frame $F_n$ above some point in $K$ such that \nthe first $n-1$ vectors in the frame belong to $TM$.  Since $K$ is compact, so is the\nframe bundle over $K$, and hence we may extract a subsequence converging to a frame \n$F_{\\infty}$. \nExponentiation of the space spanned by the first $n-1$ vectors in $F_{\\infty}$ determines \na totally geodesic immersed hypersurface $M_{\\infty}$. Lift $M_{\\infty}$ and  the $M_n$ \nto totally geodesic hypersurfaces $\\widetilde{M}_{\\infty}$ and $\\widetilde{M}_k$ in ${\\mathbf H}^n$\nso that  $\\widetilde{M}_{k}$ converges to $\\widetilde{M}_{\\infty}$ uniformly on compact \nsubsets. It follows that the sequence of distinct elements $r_{{\\widetilde{M}}_k}$ converges\nto $r_{{\\widetilde{M}}_{\\infty}}$. This contradicts the discreteness of $\\Gamma^*$.  \n\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Bounding  $N(X)$ for hyperbolic surfaces} \\label{section:surface}\n\n\n\nIn the case of surfaces, we can bound $N'(X)$ and hence $N(X)$  in terms of the area of $X$. \n\n\\begin{thm}\n\nFor each $A>0$, there exists $C_A$ such that $X$ is a complete finite area hyperbolic surface \nwith ${\\rm area}(X)<A$, then $N'(X) < C_A$.\n\n\\end{thm}\n\nThe proof consists of combining Theorem \\ref{thm:discrete-finite} with the following\nproposition. \n\n\n\\begin{prop}\n\nLet $X= {\\mathbf H}^2/\\Gamma$ be a complete finite area hyperbolic surface,\nand let $\\Gamma^*$ be a cofinite subgroup of ${\\rm Isom}({\\mathbf H}^2)$ that contains $\\Gamma$.\nThe number of closed geodesics $M \\subset X$ such that $\\Gamma(M) = \\Gamma^*$ is\nat most $\\frac{173}{4 \\pi} \\cdot Area(X)$. \n\n\\end{prop}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\nLet $G$ be the union of the $k$ closed geodesics \n$M \\subset X$ such that $\\Gamma(M) \\subset \\Gamma^*$.

To see this, we construct here a closed \nhyperbolic surface $X$ of genus two and an eigenfunction on $X$ \nsuch that vanishes on a closed geodesic with a point of self-intersection. \nBecause the self-intersection is transversal, it can not be the fixed\npoint set of a reflection.  \n \nLet $O$ be a regular geodesic octagon in the hyperbolic plane such that \nthe angle at each vertex is $\\pi/2$ \\cite{Buser}. See the figure below.\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=.4]{Example.png}\n\\end{center}\n\nChoose two geodesics that intersect orthogonally in the center of the octagon \nand that bisect opposing sides. These geodesics divide the octogon into four right-angled\npentagons. For one of these pentagons solve the eigenvalue problem \nwith Dirichlet conditions on the interior geodesics and Neumann conditions\non the exterior geodesics. Then extend to the other pentagons via \nSchwarz reflection. Because of the Neumann conditions on the exterior sides, \nwe may identifiy the oriented red sides together and the oriented green sides to obtain \nan eigenfunction on a pair of pants such that the eigenfunction vanishes \non a closed geodesic\nwith one intersection point. By doubling the surface, we obtain an \neigenfunction on a genus two surface with the desired properties. \n\nOne can also construct hyperbolic surfaces with simple closed geodesics\nthat lie in the nodal set of an eigenfunction but that do not belong to\nthe fixed point set of a reflective isometry. For example, let $P$ be a hyperbolic \npair of pants with equal boundary lengths \\cite{Buser}. Solve the eigenvalue \nproblem for the Laplacian on $P$ with Dirichlet conditions on one boundary component\nand Neumann boundary conditions on the other two boundary components. \nGlue four copies of $P$ together as indicated in the figure below.\n\n\n\\includegraphics[scale=.6]{genus-3.png}\n\n\\noindent \n\nIn particular, we use Schwarz reflection to extend the eigenfunction on $P$\nto the entire genus three surface. The eigenfunction vanishes on the simple \ngeodesics colored red in the figure above. \n\nAlthough in the examples above the closed geodesic is not the fixed point set \nof a reflection isometry, each surface does have a finite covering \nsuch that the lift of the geodesic is the fixed point set of a reflection.\nMore generally, we have the following.\n\n\\begin{prop} \\label{prop:cover}\n\nLet $X$ be a hyperbolic manifold with finite volume. \nIf $f$ is an eigenfunction that vanishes on an immersed totally\ngeodesic hypersurface $M \\subset X$, then there exists a finite cover $p:Y \\to X$\nand a lift $N$ of $M$ such that $N$ is the fixed point set of a reflection\nisometry and the lift of $f$ to $Y$ vanishes on $N$. \n\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\nLet $\\Gamma$ be a lattice such that $X = {\\mathbf H}^n/\\Gamma$, and let ${\\widetilde{f}}$\nbe the lift of $f$ that is invariant under $\\Gamma$.

The methods of  \\cite{EP15}\ncan be applied to solve the following problem:  Given a compact manifold $M$,\n$\\epsilon>0$ and $n \\in {\\mathbb N}$, there exists a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$,\n$n$ disjoint hypersurfaces $H_i$, and an eigenfuntion ${\\varphi}$ such that \neach $H_i$ is at distance at most $\\epsilon$ from a totally geodesic \nhypersurface and ${\\varphi}|_{H_i}=0$. These examples do not have negative curvature.\n\nIn \\S \\ref{section:surface}, we showed that if the dimension, $n$, of $X$ equals 2,\nthen one can bound $N'(X)$ and hence $N(X)$ \nin terms of the area of $X$. \n\n\\begin{quest}\n\nIf $n \\geq 3$, can one bound $N(X)$ in terms of the volume of $X$?\n\n\\end{quest}\n\nFor each $g$ and $p$, the supremum, $N_{g,p}$, of $N(X)$  over the finite\narea hyperbolic structures on a genus $g$ surface with $p$ punctures\nis finite.  One can easily construct examples that show that \n$N_{g,p}$ is unbounded.\n\n\\begin{quest} \\label{conj:bounded}\n\nHow does $N_{g,p}$ grow as $g$ and/or $p$ tend to infinity?\n\n\\end{quest}\n\n\nFinally, we wonder how general Proposition \\ref{prop:cover} is.  \n\n\\begin{quest}\n\nIf a totally geodesic hypersurface $H$ belongs to the nodal set of an eigenfunction on \na (real-analytic) \nRiemanian manifold $(M,g)$, then does there exist a Riemannian covering $({\\widetilde{M}}, {\\widetilde{g}})$\nand a reflection isometry of $({\\widetilde{M}}, {\\widetilde{g}})$ whose fixed point set contains a lift of $H$?  \n\n\\end{quest}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem[BJS]{BJS} Lipman Bers, Fritz John, and Martin Schechter,\n{\\em Partial differential equations.}\nReprint of the 1964 original.
