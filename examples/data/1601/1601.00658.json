It was shown that there\nare large differences between the partial width in a ``massless'' theory, in\nwhich the $b$-quark mass is kept in the Yukawa coupling but dropped in the\nmatrix element and phase space, and the full theory in which a non-zero\nbottom quark mass is retained throughout.\nThese large differences are the result of logarithms of the form\n$\\log{(m_b^2/m_H^2)}$ that can be absorbed into a re-definition of\n$m_b$ in the Yukawa coupling. As a result, if the running bottom quark mass\nis used then the massless and massive predictions are very similar. In our MCFM implementation we\nkeep the mass of the $b$-quark in full, and do not run the $b$-quark mass in the\nLO partial width. In order to ensure that the parts of the cross-section that\nare only exposed to a LO partial width are not susceptible  to the running mass\ncorrections, we divide out the partial width and normalize to the branching\nratio, $BR(H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b})$.  In this way we can also take advantage\nof advanced theoretical predictions for this branching ratio, which\nis now known to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^4)$~\\cite{Baikov:2005rw}.  In our MCFM implementation \nwe use the value obtained from the HDECAY code~\\cite{Djouadi:1997yw}. We note that, although we do not\ncurrently include effects beyond NLO in the decay, differential calculations for these\nquantities have been presented in the massless theory~\\cite{Anastasiou:2011qx,DelDuca:2015zqa}.  \n\n\n\n\\section{LHC Phenomenology }\n\\label{sec:pheno}\n\nIn this section we study the phenomenology of the $VH$ processes at\nNNLO for the LHC Run II. For the larger rate $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ decay we present results \nwhich can be compared to data collected with the current operating energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. For the rarer \n$H\\rightarrow WW^*$ and $H\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ processes we instead focus on predictions which may be\ncompared with a larger data set obtained in a future $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV run. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOur predictions are obtained using the default MCFM EW scheme, which\ncorresponds to the following parameter choices: $m_W=80.398$ GeV, $m_Z=91.1876$ GeV,\n$\\Gamma_W=2.1054$ GeV, $\\Gamma_Z =2.4952$ GeV, $G_F=1.16639 \\times\n10^{-5}$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $m_t=172$ GeV.   These are sufficient to determine\nthe remaining EW parameters.  We use\n$m_b=4.75$~GeV and set the CKM matrix elements $V_{ud} = 0.975$ and\n$V_{cs} = 0.222$.  Jets are clustered using the anti-$k_T$ jet algorithm\nwith distance parameter $R=0.4$. Unless otherwise stated, we use the CT14 pdf\nsets~\\cite{Dulat:2015mca} matched to the appropriate order in\nperturbation theory. Our default renormalization and factorization\nscale choice is $\\mu_R=\\mu_F=\\mu_0$ with $\\mu_0=m_V+m_H$.\n\n\n\nAt NNLO the dependence on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales is rather mild, especially  for\n$q\\overline{q}$ initiated processes such as those under consideration here. As a result any prescription for estimating the\nscale uncertainty, for instance by varying both scales in the same direction or varying them in opposite directions, yields\nsimilar results.  However since the $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ decay is computed at NLO, a larger scale dependence for this\ndecay is observed, with the largest deviations at NNLO (for $WH$) arising from the  case where the scales are varied in opposite\ndirections.  We will therefore present results obtained with\n$ \\mu_R = k \\mu_0$ and $\\mu_F = \\mu_0 / k$, with $k = 1/2$ and $k = 2$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Results: $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$}\n\\label{sec:Hbb}\n\n\nIn this section we present our results for LHC phenomenology for the $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ decay. \nWe will study a variety of phase space selection criteria, with cuts inspired by the ATLAS~\\cite{Aad:2014xzb} and CMS~\\cite{Chatrchyan:2013zna}\nexperiments.

Although a detailed study of the implementation of $VH$\nproduction using $N$-jettiness subtraction in MCFM will be detailed in\nref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}\\footnote{In that paper we validate the general method by comparing\nour results to those obtained using the public code\n{\\tt{vh@nnlo}}~\\cite{Brein:2003wg,Brein:2012ne}.\n\nWe therefore refer the reader to the discussion in that paper for a validation of the general implementation.},\nit is useful to revisit the discussion in the\ncontext of the cuts specified in Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:basid1})--(\\ref{eq:basid2}).\nThe $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$-dependence of the NNLO coefficient in the expansion of\nthe cross-section under these cuts ($\\Delta\\sigma^{NNLO}$), computed for the $14$~TeV LHC,  is shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:tauHbb}.  The remaining dependence on $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ is a result of power corrections,\nwhose form can be fitted according to the solid lines in the figure. The dashed lines indicate the fitting errors\non the asymptotic result for $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}} \\to 0$.\nFurther details on this fitting procedure can be found in ref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}.  It is clear that for $WH$ production\n$\\Delta\\sigma^{NNLO}$ is independent of $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ at the level of a few\npercent for $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}} \\lesssim 0.01$.  For $ZH$ production the same\nvalue of $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ yields an accuracy of about $0.5\\%$ in the\ncoefficient, where, as we will see shortly, the improvement is due to the fact that this process receives\na larger $y_t$ contribution that does not depend on $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$.\nThe accuracy of the prediction for the NNLO cross-section\ncan be assessed by combining this information with the order-by-order\nresults that are shown in Table~\\ref{table:VHbb}.  It is thus clear that\nchoosing $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}=0.01$ is sufficient for per-mille accuracy in the full\nNNLO prediction for all processes.  We shall make this choice henceforth.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nProcess & $\\sigma_{LO} $ [fb] & $\\sigma_{NLO}$ [fb] & $\\sigma_{NNLO}$ [fb] & $\\Delta\\sigma_{NNLO}$ [fb]  \\\\\n\\hline\\hline \n$W^+H\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\nu b \\bar b$     & 19.79 & 20.18 & 20.71 & 0.52 \\\\\n\\hline\n$W^-H\\rightarrow \\ell^-\\bar\\nu b \\bar b$ & 14.14 & 14.24 & 14.57 & 0.33 \\\\\n\\hline\n$ZH\\rightarrow \\ell^-\\ell^+ b \\bar b$    & 5.05  & 5.11  & 5.94  & 0.83 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cross-sections for $VH$ processes, with leptonic decay of the vector bosons and $H \\to b{\\bar b}$,\nat the 14 TeV LHC.

The left-hand plot illustrates the total rate at NLO\n(dashed) and NNLO (solid) for $WH$ and $ZH$ production.\nWe plot the cross-section for $W^+(\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\nu)H$ and\n$W^-(\\rightarrow \\ell^-\\overline{\\nu})H$ separately.  At the LHC the\nproduction of $W^+H$ is dominant, since the $u\\overline{d}$ initial state\nconfiguration has a larger flux than $d\\overline{u}$ for $pp$\ncollisions. The plots on the right hand side show the NNLO\ncoefficient, $\\Delta\\sigma^{NNLO}$. The upper and middle panels present\nresults for $W^+H$ and $W^-H$ production. The NNLO corrections in both\ncases are similar. It is interesting to compare the size of the top\ninduced cross-section $\\sigma^{(2),y_t}_{VH}$ to the total NNLO\ncoefficient. For $WH$ production the top induced pieces, after\ncuts, make up around 30-50\\% of the total $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$\ncorrection.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{xsbas.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section in femtobarns as a function of the operating energy $\\sqrt{s}$ of the LHC.

The shaded bands illustrate the scale-dependence,\ncomputed as described in the text.}\n\\label{fig:xsbas}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $Z$ boson has a much smaller branching ratio to a single family of\nleptons compared to the $W$, so the cross-sections presented in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:xsbas} for $\\ell^+\\ell^- b\\overline{b}$ are smaller than\nthe corresponding $W$ induced ones (for instance, compared to the\ninclusive results presented in ref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}). The NNLO\ncorrections are also much more important for $ZH$ production than for $WH$. This\nis due to the large contribution from the $gg\\rightarrow ZH$\npieces. The importance of the gluon flux at the LHC \ncan help to offset the $\\alpha_S$ suppression, resulting in a NNLO correction\nwhose impact is more comparable to a NLO effect. This is\nclearly visible in the lowest plot on the right-hand side of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:xsbas}, in which only the NNLO coefficient is\nshown. By far the dominant source of the correction arises from\n$\\sigma^{(2),y_t}_{ZH}$ and not $\\sigma^{(2),DY}_{ZH}$.  Of the\n$\\sigma^{(2),y_t}_{ZH}$ contribution the dominant effect is induced by the $gg$\ndiagrams, although it is not possible to separate them from the\n$V_{i}$ and $R_{i}$ pieces at this order in perturbation theory.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{WpHptV.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{WmHptV.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section in femtobarns as a function of the minimum transverse momentum of the $W^+$ (left) and $W^-$ (right) boson, $p_T^W$.

In\norder to reduce the backgrounds from top, diboson and $V+$ jets processes, cuts\non the transverse momentum of the vector boson are usually employed in\nexperimental analyses. We therefore investigate the total cross\nsection as a function of the minimum transverse momentum of the vector\nboson in Figs.~\\ref{fig:ptWxs} $(WH)$ and~\\ref{fig:ptZxs} $(ZH)$.  We\nfocus on the LHC operating at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. To produce these\nresults we apply the basic cuts described above. The results of\nthe previous figures are also manifest in these plots: the initial\nimpact of higher order corrections for $W^-H$ is slightly larger (at\nNLO), but the impact of the NNLO corrections is similar for both\ncharges in $W^{\\pm}H$.  It is also clear that $ZH$ has much larger\nNNLO corrections than $WH$. Particularly rich signal bins in the\nexperimental analysis correspond to $p_T^V > 120$~GeV and $p_T^V > 160$~GeV.\nFor these choices the signal cross-section is around 30-40\\% and $15-20\\%$ of the $p_T^V$-inclusive result,\nrespectively. The impact of NLO is a mild\nenhancement in the tail of the $p_T^V$ distribution for all process.  For\n$WH$ production the NNLO corrections are reasonably flat in $p_T^V$,\nwhile the NNLO corrections to the $ZH$ process become more pronounced in the high $p_T^V$ region.\nThis is due almost exclusively to the $y_t$ correction, which hardens the spectrum as can be clearly seen in the middle panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:ptZxs}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHnj0V.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHnj120V.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section in femtobarns as a function of the number of jets (light plus $b$-jets) for $W^+H$ at 13 TeV.

In\nFigure~\\ref{fig:njetsWp} we present the cross-section as a function of\nthe total number of jets (i.e. $b$-jets plus light jets). The plot on\nthe left-hand side has only the basic lepton cuts applied, while on\nthe right $p_T^V > 120$~GeV is required in addition to the basic\nlepton cuts.  Since the Higgs boson is a resonance decaying to massive\nquarks, a well-defined cross-section can be computed without any\nrequirement on the number of $b$-jets present.  An N$^{n}$LO\nprediction can then have between 0 and $(n+2)$ jets in the final\nstate, with the $(n+2)$-jet bin corresponding to the LO prediction for\n$VH+n$ jets. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:njetsWp} we present NLO and NNLO\npredictions, with NLO (solid) and LO (dashed) $H\\rightarrow\nb\\overline{b}$ decays. As expected the largest scale variation occurs\nin the four-jet bin (NNLO) and three-jet bin (NLO) predictions, since\nthese are LO predictions in this observable. Including the decay has a\nsignificant impact on the jet counting, particularly in the two- and\nthree-jet bins where it changes the predicted rate by\n$\\mathcal{O}(20\\%)$. The higher $p_T^V$ selection has relatively more\nthree-jet events than the more inclusive selection, which arises from\nthe kinematic favorability of balancing a high $p_T$ vector boson with\na jet and the Higgs boson. The Higgs decay at LO has no dependence on\n$\\alpha_S$ and therefore no scale dependence. When we introduce the\ndecay at NLO we include $\\alpha_S$ for the first time, and acquire a\nlarger dependence on the choice of scale.  Reducing the scale\ndependence further requires consideration of NNLO effects in the decay\nstage~\\cite{Anastasiou:2011qx,DelDuca:2015zqa}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHptbh.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHptbb.pdf} \n\\caption{Differential predictions for the transverse momenta of the hardest $b$ (left) and the $b\\overline{b}$ system (right)\nfor $W^+H$ at the LHC.

We\npresent differential distributions for the hardest $b$-jet (left) and\n$p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}$ (right), applying the basic lepton cuts,\ndemanding two $b$-jets and enforcing $p_T^V > 120$~GeV.  The general impact of\nincluding the higher order corrections in the decay is immediately\napparent as a general softening of both spectra. This is easily\nunderstood from the decay kinematics.   The invariant mass of the\nsystem is constrained to be very close to $m_H^2$. When there are three particles\npresent in the decay to share the energy, the result is a softer\nspectrum. For $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}$ the impact of higher order\ncorrections in production and decay are particularly important. At LO,\n$p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}=p_{T}^{V}$ so that the cut on the vector\nboson momentum is also a cut on $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}$. At NLO this is\nno longer necessarily the case, since the real corrections allow for\nan unclustered parton to balance the total momentum. Therefore the\nregion $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}} < 120$~GeV is first accessible at\nNLO. Since in this region of phase space the total transverse momentum\nof the $b\\overline{b}$ is by definition relatively small, the resulting\ntransverse momentum of the $b$-quark pair is also relatively soft. As\na result the region of phase space where $p_T^b$(hard)~$<120$~GeV also\nhas large higher order corrections. This is highlighted in the middle\npanel of the figures which presents the impact of higher order\ncorrections in production (for NLO decays).  Going from LO to NLO\nthere are large corrections to the $p_T$ spectrum of the\nhardest $b$ quark, however the NNLO prediction is relatively stable\nillustrating that the perturbative expansion is well-behaved beyond\nLO. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor $p_T^{b\\overline{b}}$ there is a strong feature\nat the edge of the phase space for the NLO decays that is not present for the\nLO decay option. This is due to the phase space boundary at the LO threshold in the decay phase space~\\cite{Frixione:1997ks}.\nThe virtual decay corrections reside in the $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}} > 120$ GeV region of phase space, whilst the real \ncorrections $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b} g$ can \nfill the region both above and below this value. However in the real phase space when $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}} = 120$~GeV\nthere is a restriction on the phase space  for soft gluon emission and a large logarithm arises. \nBoundary problems such as these occur frequently in perturbation theory~\\cite{Frixione:1997ks} and have been observed for\nthis specific process in previous calculations~\\cite{Ferrera:2013yga,Ferrera:2014lca}.\nFor $ZH$ production the spectrum is smoothed-out somewhat by the turn-on of the $gg\\rightarrow ZH$ contribution,\nwhich resides  in the Born phase space. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Results: $H\\rightarrow WW^*\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\nu\\ell^-\\overline{\\nu}$}\n\nThe decay $H\\rightarrow\nWW^*$ represents a significant fraction, about $20\\%$, of the total decay rate. Although requiring\nleptonic decays of the $W$ bosons reduces the rate further, the signal cross\nsections are large enough to have warranted experimental investigation in Run I\nof the LHC~\\cite{Aad:2015ona}. Going forward into Run II, triboson signatures represent a\nfresh environment in which to search for new physics. From the technical point of view the $2\\rightarrow 8$  phase\nspace is large, corresponding to a 22-dimensional Monte Carlo integration in the double-real part\nof the calculation. This therefore represents a\ndemanding application of the $N$-jettiness subtraction technique that tests its\nsuitability for complex phenomenological studies at NNLO. \nWe study the production of $VH(\\rightarrow WW^*)$ at the 14 TeV LHC with the following simple\nphase space selection criteria,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n{\\rm{Jets : }}&& \\quad  p_T^j > 25 \\; {\\rm{GeV}}, \\;  |\\eta_{j} | < 2.5  \\\\\n{\\rm{Leptons :}}&& \\quad p_T^{\\ell} > 25 \\; {\\rm{GeV}}, \\; |\\eta_{\\ell} | < 2.5 \\\\\n{\\rm{MET: }} &&  \\quad \\slashed{E}_T > 20 \\;  {\\rm{GeV}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nResults for the cross-sections obtained under these cuts are presented in Table~\\ref{table:VHWW}.\nWe present results for a single family of leptons for each  $V$ decay. Including all possibilities\nof electron and muon configurations would thus increase the total rates presented in the table by\na factor of eight. We do not consider any interference between the  leptons arising from the decay of\nthe associated vector boson and those arising from the Higgs boson decay. The primary aim of this section is to address the\nfeasibility of producing NNLO results using the SCET subtraction for a high-dimensional final\nstate configuration. We therefore postpone the treatment of interference effects for a future\nstudy.\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nProcess & $\\sigma^{VH}_{LO} $ [fb] & $\\sigma^{VH}_{NLO}$ [fb] & $\\sigma^{VH}_{NNLO}$ [fb]  \\\\\n\\hline\\hline \n$W^+H\\rightarrow \\ell_1^+\\ell^+_{2}\\ell_3^- +\\slashed{E}_T$   & 0.0293$^{+0.9\\%}_{-3.8\\%}$    &   0.0394$_{-3.1\\%}^{+2.3\\%}$ & 0.0412$^{+1.6\\%}_{-0.9\\%}$   \\\\\n\\hline\n$W^-H\\rightarrow \\ell_1^-\\ell^+_{2}\\ell_3^- +\\slashed{E}_T$     &  0.0180$^{+3.0\\%}_{-3.8\\%}$ &  0.0250$_{-2.4\\%}^{+1.6\\%}$ & 0.0261$^{+0.6\\%}_{-0.5\\%}$   \\\\\n\\hline\n$ZH\\rightarrow \\ell_1^+\\ell_1^- \\ell^+_2 \\ell_3^- +\\slashed{E}_T$ &  0.00634$_{-3.3\\%}^{+2.4\\%}$   & 0.00854$_{-1.9\\%}^{+2.7\\%}$   &  0.0104$^{+2.1\\%}_{-2.1\\%}$    \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cross-sections for $VH \\rightarrow VWW^* \\rightarrow $ leptons at the 14 TeV LHC.\nResults are presented for a single family of leptons.}\n\\label{table:VHWW}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\nAn important variable when considering the decay $H \\to WW^*$ is the transverse mass\nof the electroweak final state.  For the $WH$ process it is defined by,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \nm^{WH}_T = \\sqrt{(E_T^{3\\ell}+\\slashed{E}_T)^2-|{\\bf{p}}_T^{3\\ell}+{\\bf{\\slashed{E}_T}}|^2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nE_T^{3\\ell} = \\sqrt{{|{\\bf{p}}_T^{3\\ell}|}^2+m_{3\\ell}^2} \\;.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe equivalent definition for $ZH$ production ($m^{ZH}_T$) is obtained by making\nthe replacement $3\\ell\\rightarrow 4\\ell$. \nThe transverse mass is important since it can be used as a proxy for $m_{VH}$, which\nis not experimentally observable for $H\\rightarrow WW^*$ decays. \nThe study of this variable is interesting due to its sensitivity to high-energy\nstructures that may be present in the $HVV$ vertex in BSM scenarios.  For instance,\ntreating the SM as an EFT introduces six- (and higher-) dimensional operators that induce\nmomentum dependent couplings between the Higgs and the vector bosons\\footnote{A study of these operators \nat NLO (+PS) in the MCFM framework was presented recently in ref.~\\cite{Mimasu:2015nqa}.}.  In general these operators\nwill induce small deviations in the tails of the transverse mass distribution, so it is crucial to have\ncontrol over percent-level effects from the SM in this region. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{mvhww_WpH} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{mvhww_ZH} \n\\caption{Differential predictions for the transverse mass of the lepton-$\\slashed{E}_T$ system for $W^+H$(left) and\n$ZH$ (right) production at the 14 TeV LHC. }\n\\label{fig:mtransvh}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nOur predictions for this observable are presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:mtransvh} for $W^+H$ (left) and\n$ZH$ (right). We note that, although the cross sections presented in Table~\\ref{table:VHWW} are obtained with $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}=0.01$~GeV, we present differential \ndistributions obtained with a slightly larger value, $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}=0.04$~GeV.  This choice is made in order to obtain smoother predictions for distributions and,\ngiven the results of section~\\ref{sec:Hbb} and ref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}, we expect any difference to be negligible. \nFrom Fig.~\\ref{fig:mtransvh} the difference in shape between $m^{WH}_T$  ($W^+H$ left) and $m^{ZH}_T$   ($ZH$ right) is apparent. Since\nthe transverse mass for $ZH$ is closer in definition\nto $m_{VH}$, it has a\nmuch harder spectrum, whereas $m^{WH}_T$ is much softer. The higher-order\ncorrections for $ZH$ are much larger, primarily due to the significant $gg\\rightarrow ZH$ contribution.\nThese pieces \nare sensitive to the $2 m_{t}$ thresholds present in the loop integrals, and as a result turn on\nat $m^{ZH}_T \\sim 300$ GeV.  In this region the NNLO corrections are much larger\nand the shape of $m^{ZH}_T$ is significantly altered. It is therefore essential\nto include NNLO predictions for this observable in order to avoid attributing any observed change\nin shape to the presence of BSM physics. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{njets_WHWW.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{njets_ZHWW.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section as a function of the number of jets, $n_{j}$, for $W^+H$ (left) and $ZH$ (right) with $H\\rightarrow WW^*$ decays at the 14 TeV LHC}\n\\label{fig:njHWW}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\nFinally in Fig.~\\ref{fig:njHWW} we present the cross-section as a function of the number of additional jets,\nwhere the basic jet definition is used from the previous section, $p_T^j > 25$ GeV and $|\\eta_{j}| < 2.5$.

The standout result from Run\nI of the LHC was the discovery of a Higgs\nboson~\\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj}. One of the principal\nphysics goals of Run II is to pin down the precise nature of the Higgs\nboson and in particular how it interacts with the other \nparticles of the Standard\nModel (SM). In order to do this a range of Higgs production and decay\nprocesses must be studied in greater detail than ever before. A\nsignificant improvement that is expected in Run II analyses\nis their ability to study the Higgs differentially for a\nwider range of processes.\n\nOne such fascinating process is the production of a Higgs boson in\nassociation with a $W$ or $Z$ electroweak vector boson,\ni.e. $pp\\rightarrow VH$ where $V$ denotes the vector boson. At LHC energies these processes are the third\n($V=W$) and fourth ($V=Z$) largest production channels. $VH$ production\nis somewhat special, in that it proceeds at Leading Order (LO) through\nan $s$-channel Feynman diagram. This results in the opportunity to\nprobe the $VVH$ vertex at high momentum transfer while keeping the\nfinal state vector and Higgs bosons on-shell, for instance by looking\nin the region of large $m_{VH}$. This is an interesting region to\nstudy, since contributions arising from physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) \nmay induce a momentum dependent term in the $VVH$ vertex~\\cite{Buchmuller:1985jz,Hagiwara:1993ck,Contino:2013kra}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew physics at TeV scales would modify the SM cross-section\nat the level of a few percent.  Accordingly, it is essential that the SM\ncross-section is known at this level or better.\n\nA second distinguishing feature of the $pp\\rightarrow VH$ process is\nthe ability to study the decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of bottom\nquarks, $H \\to b\\overline{b}$. Such a decay is extremely\ndifficult to measure in inclusive Higgs boson production,\ngiven the small rate of $gg\\rightarrow H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$\ncompared to the QCD production of the same final state. It is essential\nthat the decay $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ is measured experimentally\nsince it provides a direct measurement of the coupling of the Higgs boson to\nfermions.  Moreover,  since it dominates the total width, the uncertainty on\nthis branching ratio feeds into other searches, for instance,\nmeasurements of the Higgs invisible branching ratio. The presence of\nthe vector boson in the final state allows experimental analyses to\nhave manageable backgrounds, in particular when the Higgs is highly\nboosted and the two $b$-quarks reside inside a fat\njet~\\cite{Butterworth:2008iy}. Again it is essential that accurate\ntheoretical predictions are available, with the ability to apply\nintricate final state phase space selection requirements.\n\n\n\n\nGiven its importance, the $pp\\rightarrow VH$ processes have been\nextensively studied in the theoretical literature. At LO the topology\nis essentially the same as that of Drell-Yan (DY) production, and this\nwas utilized to obtain the first Next-to-Next-to Leading Order (NNLO)\npredictions for on-shell bosons in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2003wg}. However at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ a second type of diagram appears, in which\ninstead of coupling to the vector boson, the Higgs is radiated from a\nclosed loop of heavy fermions. These ``$y_t$'' pieces\\footnote{We refer to\n  these pieces with the label $y_t$ in this paper, despite the fact that we also include the\n  $gg\\rightarrow Z^*\\rightarrow ZH$ contributions (that do not go like\n  $y_t$) in this term.}  were computed for on-shell vector\nbosons in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx}. A fully differential calculation,\nincluding the decays of the bosons, was presented for the DY parts of\n$WH$ in refs.~\\cite{Ferrera:2011bk,Ferrera:2013yga} and for $ZH$ in\nref.~\\cite{Ferrera:2014lca}. A subset of the $y_t$ diagrams,\ncorresponding to those which are initiated by a pair of gluons\n$gg\\rightarrow HZ$ was also included in the calculation of\nref.~\\cite{Ferrera:2014lca}. Electroweak corrections were calculated\nin ref.~\\cite{Ciccolini:2003jy,Denner:2011id} while resummation effects have\nbeen studied in ref.~\\cite{Dawson:2012gs}. There has also been\nsignificant progress in matching fixed order calculations to parton\nshower Monte Carlos, allowing for full event simulation. An\nimplementation of the $VH$ process in the POWHEG formalism was\npresented in~\\cite{Hamilton:2009za} and extended to merge with the\n$VH+$jet process in ref.~\\cite{Luisoni:2013cuh}. A SHERPA implementation that\nmerges the $VH$ and $VH+$jet processes was also presented recently in\nref.~\\cite{Goncalves:2015mfa}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe historical bottleneck for NNLO computations was in the\nconstruction of regularization schemes to handle the InfraRed (IR)\nsingularities. These singularities are ubiquitous in a NNLO\ncalculation, since they occur in the two-loop (double virtual),\none-loop~$\\times$~real (real-virtual) and the real-real part of the\ncalculation. The situation is made more complicated by the different\ndimensionality of the phase space in each part. The double-virtual has\nthe same dimension as the Born, and IR singularities manifest\nthemselves as poles in an $\\epsilon$ expansion (where $d=4-2\\epsilon$,\nwith $\\epsilon$ parameterizing excursions from four dimensions). The\nreal-virtual has one additional parton in the final state, and\npossesses IR singularities which manifest themselves as $\\epsilon$\npoles, and when the emitted parton becomes unresolved. Finally the\nreal-real piece corresponds to the emission of two additional partons\nand its IR singularities correspond to when one, or both partons\nbecome unresolved. Constructing a scheme to regulate these divergences\nhas been a ongoing task for many\nyears~\\cite{GehrmannDeRidder:2005cm,Catani:2007vq,Czakon:2010td}. Recently\na new regularization scheme, based upon $N$-jettiness\n\\cite{Stewart:2010tn} has been\nproposed~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Gaunt:2015pea}. Here the idea is\nsimilar to that used in $q_T$ subtraction~\\cite{Catani:2007vq}. Both\nmethods introduce a variable which separates the singly unresolved\nregions from the doubly unresolved ones. If an all-orders formulation\n(i.e. a factorization theorem) is known for the doubly unresolved\nregion, then an expansion can be performed to a fixed order in the\ncoupling. The singly unresolved region corresponds to the NLO\ncalculation of the process with an additional parton, which can be\nevaluated using traditional means.  For $q_T$ subtraction, applicable\nto production of colour neutral final states, the separation is\nobtained via a $q_T$ cut. If $q_T > q_T^{\\rm{cut}}$ then the electroweak (EW) system\nrecoils against a parton, and only single unresolved limits can occur\n(i.e. the NLO calculation of the EW final state together with one\nadditional parton). For $q_T <\nq_T^{\\rm{cut}}$ the all-orders factorization of Collins, Soper and\nSterman~\\cite{Collins:1984kg} can be used. In\nrefs.~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva,Gaunt:2015pea} $N$-jettiness~\\cite{Stewart:2010tn}  was proposed\nas the separation-cut i.e. $\\tau_N > \\tau_N^{\\rm{cut}}$ defines a NLO\ncalculation. When $\\tau_N < \\tau_N^{\\rm{cut}}$ Soft Collinear\nEffective Field Theory\n(SCET)~\\cite{Bauer:2000ew,Bauer:2000yr,Bauer:2001yt,Bauer:2001ct,Bauer:2002nz}\ncan be used to approximate the full expression. An advantage of this\nmethod is that it can be applied to coloured final states with jets.  The\nrecent advances in (a variety of) NNLO regularization schemes has\nled to a veritable explosion in the number of phenomenological\npredictions at NNLO for $2\\rightarrow 2$\nscattering~\\cite{Currie:2013dwa,Chen:2014gva,Brucherseifer:2014ama,Boughezal:2015dva,Boughezal:2015aha,Boughezal:2015dra,Czakon:2015owf,Ridder:2015dxa,Boughezal:2015ded,Cacciari:2015jma}\n\n\n\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. Our chief goal is to provide the first\nNNLO calculation including both the DY and $y_t$ contributions, with\nfull flexibility in the boson decays for both $WH$ and $ZH$\nprocesses. Second, we will apply the recently-developed SCET formalism\nto a detailed phenomenological study, including the process\n$VH\\rightarrow VWW \\rightarrow $leptons. Such decays have not\npreviously been included in NNLO codes, but are studied\nexperimentally. Given the large and intricate final state phase space\n(22 dimensions for the double-real part) this is a particularly good\nexample to test the feasibility of the SCET regularization to provide\nNNLO predictions for complicated phenomenological applications. Our results are\nimplemented in MCFM~\\cite{Campbell:1999ah,Campbell:2011bn,Campbell:2015qma},\nand will be made publicly available in a forthcoming release.\n\n\nThis  paper proceeds as follows. In section~\\ref{sec:calc} we present an\noverview of the component pieces needed to complete the calculation of $VH$ at\nNNLO. Phenomenological results for the LHC Run II are then presented in\nsection~\\ref{sec:pheno}. We draw our conclusions in section~\\ref{sec:conc}. We\npresent a detailed discussion of the helicity amplitudes\nneeded in the computation of the NNLO correction in Appendices~\\ref{app:DYamp}\nand~\\ref{app:ytamp}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Calculation} \n\\label{sec:calc}\n\nIn this section we describe the details of our NNLO calculation for\n$VH$ production and its implementation into a fully flexible Monte Carlo\ncode. The aim of this section is to provide an overview of the\ncalculation, and its subsequent implementation in MCFM. Technical details regarding the calculation of the \namplitudes are presented in Appendices~\\ref{app:DYamp}-\\ref{app:ytamp}.  At NNLO the\nproduction cross-section $d\\sigma^{(2)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}$ \ncan be written as the sum of two terms,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nd\\sigma^{(2)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}= d\\sigma^{(2),DY}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}+d\\sigma^{(2),y_t}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}\n\\label{eq:xsdecomp}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere the first term represents the contributions which have the same structure\nas single vector boson production, the second term represents a new type of\ncontribution that occurs first at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$. These pieces\narise from terms in which the Higgs boson couples directly to a heavy quark\n(predominantly a top-quark).  In the following sections we first describe these two contributions in more detail,\nand then discuss our handling of the decays of the Higgs boson. \n\n\n\\subsection{Drell-Yan type contributions} \n\nAt LO and NLO the production cross-section\n$d\\sigma^{(i)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}$ (where $i=0,1)$\nhas the same structure as the calculation of single vector\nboson production. At LO only $q\\overline{q}$ initial states contribute,\nwhile the NLO\ncorrections consist of virtual (one-loop) corrections to this process, and\nreal-radiation in which the underlying matrix elements contain a\n$q\\overline{q}$ pair and a gluon. Representative Feynman diagrams for these pieces are illustrated in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:DYNLO} where, for simplicity, we have suppressed the decays\nof the vector and Higgs bosons.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{DYNLO.pdf} \n\\caption{Drell-Yan like production modes for the associated production of a Higgs boson. Shown are representative Feynman diagrams needed \nto compute the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_S^0)$ (left) and $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_S)$ (center and right) parts of the production cross-section.}\n\\label{fig:DYNLO}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\nAt NNLO the production cross-section receives contributions from the\n$VH + 0,1$ and 2 parton phase spaces. Representative Feynman diagrams\nfor each of these terms are presented in Figure~\\ref{fig:DYNNLO}.\nUtilizing the similarities with the NNLO calculation of the Drell-Yan\nprocess~\\cite{Hamberg:1990np}, cross-sections for inclusive on-shell\n$VH$ production were presented at this order in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2003wg}.  At\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ $d\\sigma^{(2),DY}_{pp\\rightarrow\n  \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}$ contains UV poles which we renormalize in the\n$\\overline{\\rm{MS}}$ scheme. In addition to the UV divergences,\n$d\\sigma^{(2),DY}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}$ contains\nsingularities of IR origin. In order to regularize these we use the\nrecently developed ``jettiness subtraction''\nprocedure~\\cite{Gaunt:2015pea,Boughezal:2015dva,Boughezal:2015aha,Boughezal:2015ded}. This\nprocedure uses the $N$-jettiness variable of SCET ($\\tau_N$)\nto divide the NNLO calculation into two pieces based on the value of\n$\\tau_N$. Below the $\\tau$-cutoff parameter the technology of\nSCET~\\cite{Bauer:2000ew,Bauer:2000yr,Bauer:2001yt,Bauer:2001ct,Bauer:2002nz}\nis used to provide an approximation for the full calculation. Above\nthe $\\tau_N$-cutoff the calculation reduces to a NLO computation of the\n($VH+j$) process, and can\nbe evaluated using traditional techniques. In MCFM the IR regularization of the\nNLO $VHj$ processes is obtained via the Catani-Seymour dipole formalism~\\cite{Catani:1996vz}.\nSince the SCET formalism\nbelow the $\\tau_N$-cutoff is approximate and subject to power corrections,\nthe value of $\\tau_N$ should be taken\nas small as possible. A check of the implementation is\nthus obtained by checking the cancellation of the logarithmic pieces\nabove and below the cut. For our process, which does not contain any\nfinal state jets in the Born phase space, the $\\tau_N$-cutoff\nprocedure is similar to the $q_T$ subtraction technique~\\cite{Catani:2007vq}\nused in previous calculations~\\cite{Ferrera:2011bk}.  A detailed study\nof the $N$-jettiness regularization for colour singlet final states and\ntheir implementation in MCFM will be presented in ref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}, to which we\nrefer the interested reader for more details.  MCFM also contains implementations of\none-jet production in association with a Higgs~\\cite{Boughezal:2015aha},\n$W$~\\cite{Boughezal:2015dva} or $Z$~\\cite{Boughezal:2015ded} boson.\n\nIn order to implement the DY pieces in MCFM we need the two-loop virtual\namplitude~\\cite{Hamberg:1990np} interpreted in terms of the hard function of\nSCET~\\cite{Becher:2009cu,Becher:2009qa}, and the NLO implementation of $VH+j$. The results for the two-loop virtual\namplitude are readily available in the literature~\\cite{Hamberg:1990np}.\nWe have calculated the NLO corrections to the $VH+j$ process and implemented\nthem in MCFM.  Details of the relevant calculational ingredients are\npresented in Appendix~\\ref{app:DYamp}. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{DYNNLO.pdf} \n\\caption{Drell-Yan like production modes for the associated production of a Higgs boson.

Not all of the diagrams depend on $y_t$ as can be seen from \nthe examples on the left ($y_t$) and right (no~$y_t$). \nThese topologies only occur for $ZH$ production.}\n\\label{fig:ggZH}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\nA new type of process opens up at $\\mathcal{O}({\\alpha_s}^2)$ and corresponds\nto diagrams in which the Higgs boson does not couple directly to the\nvector boson, but instead couples to a massive quark. Since the\ntop quark has by far the largest Yukawa coupling, these contributions\nare dominated by the top-quark loops. These $y_t$ diagrams further\nsub-divide into two categories. Diagrams of the first kind,\nrepresentatives of which are presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:WHtop}, contain\na closed loop of heavy quarks which does not radiate the vector\nboson. The second kind, illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ZHtop}, contains\ndiagrams that include a\nclosed loop of fermions which radiates both the Higgs and the vector\nboson.  Charge conservation mandates that the latter examples are\nforbidden if the radiated boson is a $W$. Therefore the first\ntopologies (Fig.~\\ref{fig:WHtop}) occur for both $WH$ and $ZH$ production\nand the latter topologies occur only in the $ZH$ case. Both sets of topologies\ncan have two-loop $q\\overline{q}$ topologies, which interfere with the LO\namplitude, and one-loop $q\\overline{q} g$ topologies, which interfere\nwith the $q\\overline{q} g VH$ tree amplitude. These pieces have been\ncomputed for on-shell final state particles in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} and we\nfollow the nomenclature introduced in that paper. We refer to the\ntwo-loop diagrams by the label $V$ and the one-loop diagrams by $R$.\nThe sub-topologies of these sets are further\ndistinguished by $I$ (for diagrams that occur for both\n$WH$ and $ZH$ production) and $II$ ($ZH$ only).  In ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx}\nthese pieces were computed and found to contribute around 1--3$\\%$ of\nthe total NNLO cross-section. Whilst this may appear to be a small\ncontribution that can safely be neglected, the total NNLO correction\nfrom the DY-type diagrams discussed previously is itself of the same\norder. Therefore in order to obtain a reliable prediction at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ it is crucial to include both contributions.\nHence a primary aim of this paper is to implement the corrections in this\nway in a fully flexible Monte Carlo code.\n\nFinally we observe that for $ZH$ production a gluon-initiated loop arises\nthat interferes with itself at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$. Example diagrams\nare depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ggZH}. Due to the enhancement from the gluon\nparton distribution function (pdf) these contributions represent a large part of\nthe NNLO correction, particularly in the boosted regime that is defined\nby high vector boson, or Higgs boson, transverse\nmomentum~\\cite{Englert:2013vua}. \nThroughout this paper we include the $gg\\rightarrow ZH$ \ndiagrams in the $y_t$ contribution. This is a slight abuse of nomenclature\nsince, as can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ggZH}, there is a triangle diagram corresponding to\n$gg \\rightarrow Z^* \\rightarrow ZH$, where the virtual $Z$ boson\nradiates a Higgs boson. The $gg\\rightarrow HZ$ contribution\nwas included in the on-shell prediction of~\\cite{Brein:2003wg} and in the more\ndifferential calculation of ref.~\\cite{Ferrera:2014lca}. NLO corrections have\nbeen considered in the heavy top limit in ref.~\\cite{Altenkamp:2012sx} and\nfurther improved through soft gluon resummation in ref.~\\cite{Harlander:2014wda}.\n\nThe one-loop processes $R_I$, $R_{II}$ and $gg\\rightarrow HZ$ can all be\ncalculated in the full theory in which the top mass is retained. The\ncalculation of the two-loop $V_I$ and $V_{II}$ contributions in the\nfull theory is much more complicated and at present, the master\nintegrals are not fully known. Therefore in our calculation and that\nof ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} an asymptotic expansion in $m_t$ is\nperformed. Since both $V$ and $R$ pieces are separately finite, there\nis some freedom in how the top quark is treated in each part of the\ncalculation.  Our strategy is to include the full top mass effects\nwhere possible and to perform an asymptotic expansion only when\nneeded.  Finally we note that $R_{II}$ was found to have a very small\neffect on the total prediction in~ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} so we do\nnot include it in our calculation of $ZH$.  Technical details\nregarding our implementation of these pieces in MCFM are presented in\nAppendix~\\ref{app:ytamp}.\n\n\\subsection{Decays of unstable bosons} \n\nThe aim of this paper is to present a fully flexible Monte Carlo code\nfor the associated production of a Higgs and vector boson. A crucial\nelement of this flexibility is to ensure that the relevant decays of\nthe Higgs and vector bosons are included.\n\n\nDecays of vector bosons to leptons represent the cleanest experimental\nsignature of these processes, so in this paper we focus on the decays\n$W\\rightarrow \\ell\\nu$ and $Z\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\ell^-$.  For the Higgs\nboson the $b\\overline{b}$ decay is the most useful, primarily due to\nits high yield rather than its experimental\ncleanliness~\\cite{Aad:2014xzb,Chatrchyan:2013zna}. However,\n$H\\rightarrow WW^*$ decays also provide a viable experimental\nsignature with the current data\nset~\\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-005,CMS:2013xda}. The high luminosity runs\nof the LHC may also be able to study rarer channels, such as\n$VH\\rightarrow \\ell\\ell\\gamma\\gamma$. These channels are much cleaner,\nsince the dominant irreducible backgrounds from $V\\gamma\\gamma$ are\nmuch smaller, but the small $H\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ branching\nratio makes detailed studies of this process impractical at present.\n\n\nThe decays discussed above are easily incorporated in Monte Carlo\ncodes. However, when considering higher-order QCD corrections, the\ndecay $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ requires further discussion since\nradiation can occur in both production and decay stages. At NLO\n($\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$) the conservation of colour ensures a complete\nfactorization between production and decay processes. The situation is\nmore complicated at NNLO ($\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$) since here\ncontributions exist which connect the initial- and final-state\npartons.  It has been shown~\\cite{Fadin:1993kt,Fadin:1993dz} that\nthese these (non-factorizable) pieces contribute to the total rate at\norder $\\Gamma_H/m_{b\\bar{b}}$ where $\\Gamma_H$ is the Higgs boson\nwidth.  The situation for differential distributions is less precise,\nbut it is plausible that for distributions where $b$ and $\\bar{b}$ are\nnot distinguished the non-factorizable contributions should be\nsimilarly small.  In our calculations we therefore neglect such\neffects and follow a factorized approach in which the Higgs decay is\nincluded to NLO accuracy.  We follow the procedure outlined in\nrefs.~\\cite{Ferrera:2013yga,Ferrera:2014lca} and define,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nd\\sigma^{\\mathrm{NNLO}} \\equiv\nd\\sigma^{\\mathrm{NNLO(prod)+NLO(dec)}}_{pp\\rightarrow VH \\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 b\\overline{b}} &=& Br(H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}) \\nonumber\n\\times\\bigg\\{ d\\sigma^{(0)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H} \\times \\frac{d\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow{b\\overline{b}}}+d\\Gamma^{(1)}_{H\\rightarrow{b\\overline{b}}}}{\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}}+\\Gamma^{(1)}_{H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}}}\n\\nonumber\\\\&&+\n\\left(d\\sigma^{(1)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}+d\\sigma^{(2)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}\\right)\\times \\frac{d\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow{b\\overline{b}}}}{\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}}}\n\\bigg\\}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIn the above equation $d\\sigma^{(i)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H}$ represents the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^i)$ term in the perturbative expansion for the production of\na Higgs boson and a pair of leptons. $d\\Gamma^{i}_{H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}}$ represents the differential partial width at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^i)$ for the\n$H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ decay, whilst $\\Gamma^{i}_{H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}}$ represents the integrated partial width for these decays. \nIn order to study the effect of the pure NNLO corrections it is also useful to define,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nd(\\Delta\\sigma^{\\mathrm{NNLO}}) = Br(H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}) \\times\nd\\sigma^{(2)}_{pp\\rightarrow \\ell_1\\ell_2 H} \\times \\frac{d\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow{b\\overline{b}}}}{\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}}}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"d(\\Delta\\sigma^{\\mathrm{NNLO}})=Br(H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b})\\times d\\sigma^{%&#10;(2)}_{pp\\rightarrow\\ell_{1}\\ell_{2}H}\\times\\frac{d\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow{b%&#10;\\overline{b}}}}{\\Gamma^{(0)}_{H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><msup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>NNLO</mi></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>B</mi><mi>r</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2192</mo><mi>b</mi><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>b</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>d</mi><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>\u2192</mo><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2113</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2113</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u00d7</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2192</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>b</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow><msubsup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2192</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>b</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00658.tex", "nexttext": "\nThese cross-sections are for illustration only and are therefore evaluated at LO.

These two contributions are comparable in size for $WH$ production.  For the $ZH$ process\nthe latter corrections involve $gg$-initiated diagrams that dominate the NNLO correction.  Including both contributions is\ntherefore imperative and our calculation enables the combined effects to be studied in a differential manner for the\nfirst time.   Analytic results for these amplitudes can be found in the appendix and the distributed MCFM code.  \n\nThe $VH$ processes are among the most interesting Higgs production modes for phenomenological studies in Run II.\nWe have therefore studied a number of decay modes of the Higgs boson in some detail.  In the case of the\ndecay to a pair of bottom quarks, $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$, we have also included the effect of radiation in the \ndecay at NLO accuracy.  This has a considerable impact on, for instance, the transverse momentum of the $b\\bar b$ pair.\nOur results suggest that including QCD corrections in the decay to NNLO is important, although it is beyond the scope\nof this paper.  We have investigated the phenomenology of other Higgs decay channels that might be explored more fully\nin Run II of the LHC, namely the decays  $H\\rightarrow WW^* \\rightarrow$ leptons and $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$.\n\n\nFrom the theoretical point of view, presenting a NNLO\ncalculation for the $2\\rightarrow 6$ process, $pp \\to VH \\to VWW^* \\to$~leptons+$\\slashed{E}_T$ is technically\nchallenging due to the large final state phase space. In the double-real part\nof the calculation the phase space is 22-dimensional, and provides a challenging environment in which to test the jettiness-based\napproach to NNLO calculations.  The $H\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ decay results in very small cross-sections, but has the advantage\nthat the irreducible background in the neighborhood of the Higgs boson mass is also small, resulting in comparable signal and\nbackground rates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of this paper have been implemented into MCFM, and will be made available in a forthcoming release of the code. \n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\n\nWe thank Radja Boughezal, Xiaohui Liu and Frank Petriello for assisting in the implementation\nof the $N$-jettiness regularization procedure in MCFM. \nCW thanks Shawn Matott for computational help and JC is grateful to the Fermilab computing sector for\nproviding access to the Accelerator Simulations Cluster.\nFermilab is supported by the US DOE under contract DE-AC02-07CH11359.

We present results for  contributions above and below\n$\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ separately. Since the Higgs boson is a scalar particle the decay amplitude\nfactorizes from  the production amplitude, modulo ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ corrections that we\nneglect in our calculation. Therefore the results in this section are presented for an on-shell\nHiggs boson and a $V$ boson that decays to leptons are included.  We have used the Mathematica\npackage S@M~\\cite{Maitre:2007jq} frequently in our calculations. \n\n\n\\subsection{Below $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$}\n\nBelow $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ the calculation requires the soft, beam, and hard functions of the SCET\nformalism.  The required soft and beam functions can be found in, for example,\nref.~\\cite{Gaunt:2015pea}. The process-dependent  hard-function can be extracted from the two-loop virtual \nform-factor as outlined in refs.~\\cite{Becher:2009cu,Becher:2009qa}. We have repeated the  calculation\nand for completeness we reproduce the $1$- and $2-$loop results below, \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}\\right\\rangle_{\\overline{MS}} &=& C_F\\left(\\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{2\\pi}\\right) \\left(-L^2-3L+8-\\zeta_2\\right)|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rangle \\\\\n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(2)}\\right\\rangle_{\\overline{MS}} &=&\\left(\\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 \\bigg[C_F^2\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}(L^2-3L+8-\\zeta_2)^2 \\nonumber\\\\&&\n      +\\left(\\frac{3}{2}-12\\zeta_2+24\\zeta_3\\right)L \n      -\\frac{1}{8}+29\\zeta_2-30\\zeta_3-\\frac{44}{5}\\zeta_2^2\\bigg) \\nonumber\\\\&&\n      +C_FN_f\\bigg(-\\frac{2}{9}L^3+\\frac{19}{9}L^2-\\left(\\frac{209}{27}+\\frac{4}{3}\\zeta_2\\right)L\n     +\\frac{4085}{324}+\\frac{23}{9}\\zeta_2+\\frac{2}{9}\\zeta_3\\bigg)\\nonumber\\\\&&\n     +C_FC_A\\bigg(\\frac{11}{9}L^3+\\left(2\\zeta_2-\\frac{233}{18}\\right)L^2\n      +\\left(\\frac{2545}{54}+\\frac{22}{3}\\zeta_2-26\\zeta_3\\right)L\\nonumber\\\\&&\n      -\\frac{51157}{648}-\\zeta_2\\left(\\frac{337}{18}-\\frac{44}{5}\\zeta_2\\right)+\\frac{313}{9}\\zeta_3\\bigg)\\bigg]\n      \\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\right\\rangle\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $L=\\log{\\left({-s_{12}}/{\\mu^2}\\right)}$ and $\\left|M^{(0)}\\right\\rangle$\nrepresents the LO amplitude. Note that the above amplitudes are defined in four-dimensions\nand as such the LO amplitude (for $WH$ production) can be defined in terms of helicity\namplitudes as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\right\\rangle_{WH}=g_W^3 m_W \\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34})\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},4^-_{\\ell},p_H)\n\\end{eqnarray} \nIn the above equation $\\mathcal{P}$ represents the propagator function, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{P}_X(s) = \\frac{s}{s-m_X^2+i m_X\\Gamma_X} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe tree-level helicity amplitude is then defined as follows\\footnote{We refer readers unfamiliar with spinor-helicity notation to one of the many \ncomprehensive reviews, for instance ref.~\\cite{Dixon:1996wi}}, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},4^-_{\\ell},p_H)= \\frac{\\spa1.4{[ 3 .]}2}{s_{34}s_{12}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIt is instructive to re-write this amplitude as, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},4^-_{\\ell},p_H)= -\\frac{1}{s_{12}}\\left(\\frac{{\\langle 1  .\\rangle}4^2}{{\\langle 1  .\\rangle}2\\spa3.4}+\\frac{\\spa1.4{\\langle 1|.|p]}_H.3}{\\spa1.2 s_{34}}\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nModulo the overall factor of $s_{12}$, which is a result of the internal $W$ propagator function,\nthe holomorphic piece of the above expression (the first term) corresponds exactly to the  MHV\ntree-level amplitude for $q\\overline{q}\\ell\\overline{\\nu}$. The second, non-holomorphic, term\nis a correction that vanishes in the soft Higgs boson limit. Since the amplitudes for $W+3$\nand $W+4$ partons have been calculated analytically~\\cite{Giele:1991vf,Bern:1997sc} the above\ndecomposition provides a useful check of all of our calculated amplitudes.\n\nThe helicity breakdown for the $ZH$ process requires a summation over the left and right-handed couplings \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\right\\rangle_{ZH}=2\\frac{g_W e^2}{\\cos^2\\theta_W}m_W \\mathcal{P}_H(s_{1234})\\mathcal{P}_Z(s_{34})\n\\sum_{ij = L,R} v^{q}_{i}v^{\\ell}_{i} \\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{ij}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nThe fermionic (quark or lepton) coupling to the $Z$ boson is given by $v_{h}^{(q,\\ell)}$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nv_{L}^{\\ell}=\\frac{-1-2Q_{\\ell}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \\quad v_{R}^{\\ell}=-\\frac{2Q_{\\ell}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \\nonumber\\\\\nv_{L}^{q}=\\frac{\\pm1-2Q_{q}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \\quad v_{R}^{q}=-\\frac{2Q_{q}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe sign in the $v_{L}^{q}$ term is determined by whether the quark is up ($+$) or down ($-$)\ntype. The helicity amplitudes are then obtained from the equivalent amplitudes for the $WH$\nprocess, by applying line reversal symmetries as necessary.\n\n\n\\subsection{Above $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$}\n\nAbove $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ the calculation corresponds to a NLO one for the $VH +$ jet process. We have\ncalculated helicity amplitudes for this process which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been\npresented in the literature before. The LO amplitude for $WHj$ can be written as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rangle_{WHj} =\\sqrt{2}g_s g_W^3 m_W (T^{g_5})^{i_1}_{j_2} \\;\\mathcal{P}_H(s_{12345})\\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34})\n\\sum_{h_5=\\pm1}\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{h_5},p_H) \\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray} \nThe tree-level MHV helicity amplitude is  defined as, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_4(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{+},p_H)=-\\frac{\\spa1.3\\spab1.P_{25}.4}{s_{125}s_{34}\\spa1.5\\spa2.5}\n\\label{eq:A0WHj}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $P_{25}=p_2+p_5$.  The helicity amplitude for $h_5=-1$ can be readily obtained from the above by the conjugation operation. \nAt NLO we require the one-loop amplitude for $WHj$ and the tree-level amplitudes for $WHjj$. The one-loop amplitude for $WHj$ can be written as follows, \n \\begin{eqnarray} \n|\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}\\rangle_{WHj} &=&\\sqrt{2}g_s g_W^3 m_W N_c (T^{g_5})^{i_1}_{j_2} \\;\\mathcal{P}_H(s_{12345})\\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34})\n\\\\&\\times&\n\\sum_{h_5=\\pm1}\\bigg(\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_1(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{+},p_H) + \\frac{1}{N_c^2}\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_2(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{+},p_H)\\bigg)\n\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}   \nAs discussed in the previous subsection, the amplitudes for $VHj$ can be decomposed in terms of those for $Vj$ and a piece which vanishes in the soft limit (where it is understood that momentum conservation is altered accordingly in the $Vj$ amplitude). We use this decomposition on our one-loop amplitudes, defining, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_i\n =V_i  \\mathcal{A}^{(0)}+F_i + S^H_i\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}$ is understood to be given by eq.~\\eqref{eq:A0WHj}. $V_i$ and $F_i$ then correspond\nexactly to the amplitudes obtained in the calculation of the $W+3$ parton one-loop amplitude, and $S_i^H$\ncorresponds to the missing piece which vanishes in the soft Higgs limit. For brevity we do not reproduce the results\nfor $V_i$ and $F_i$ here, they can be found in the literature~\\cite{Bern:1997sc} or in the distributed MCFM code.\nThe leading colour contribution $S^H_1$ has the following form, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n S^H_1 = -\\frac{3\\spa2.1\\spab3.P_{125}.4\\spb5.2}{2s_{125}^2\\spa2.5}L_0(-s_{25},-s_{125})\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhile the subleading colour contribution $S^2_H$ is \n \\begin{eqnarray}\nS^H_2&=&\\frac{\\spa1.2{\\langle 3|.|P]}_{125}.4 }{s_{125}\\spa1.5^2}{\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{1m}_{4F}}}(-s_{12},-s_{25};-s_{125})         \n \\nonumber\\\\&& +\n\\frac{\\spa1.2\\spb5.1{\\langle 3|.|P]}_{125}.4}{s_{125}\\spa1.5}\\left(    \\frac{L_0(-s_{125},-s_{25})}{s_{25}}-\\frac{L_0(-s_{125},-s_{12})}{s_{12}}\\right)\n \\nonumber\\\\&&-\\frac{\\spb5.1{\\langle 3|.|P]}_{125}.4}{s_{125}\\spa1.5\\spb2.1}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n Here ${\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{1m}_{4F}}}$ represents the finite part of the one-mass box integral and is given by, \n \\begin{eqnarray}\n {\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{1m}_{4F}}}(s,t;P^2) = -2\\left(\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{s}\\bigg)+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{t}\\bigg)+\\frac{1}{2}\\log^2\\left(\\frac{s}{t}\\right)\n +\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray} \n and the auxiliary function $L_0(s,t)$ is,\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n L_0(s,t)=\\frac{\\log{s/t}}{1-s/t}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n The amplitudes for $ZH$ production can be obtained in similar fashion to the tree-level discussion in the previous\n sub-section, i.e. by appropriate dressing of the helicity amplitudes by the left- and right-handed couplings and\n modification of the electroweak pre-factor accordingly. \n\n\\section{Amplitudes for $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ $y_t$ contributions} \n\n\\label{app:ytamp}\n\nIn this section we present formulae for some of the amplitudes that contribute to the term\n$d\\sigma^{(2),y_t}$.  There are in principle five such terms, labelled in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} as $V_I$, $V_{II}$,\n$R_{I}$, $R_{II}$ and $gg$-initiated pieces.  In this section we follow closely the formalism and nomenclature used in that reference,\nwhich presents these contributions for on-shell bosons.  Here we do not include any results for $R_{II}$ since its\neffects are tiny and not accounted-for in our calculation.  We also do not present our analytic results for the\n$gg \\to ZH$ contribution, which are too lengthy to include here but may be inspected in the distributed MCFM code. \n\n\\subsection{$V_I$ pieces}\n\nWe begin by considering the $V_I$ pieces, which occur for both $W$ and $Z$ associated production\n(cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:WHtop}, right). Using the method of asymptotic \nexpansions\\footnote{see, for example, the discussion in refs.~\\cite{Smirnov:1994tg,Harlander:1999cs}} it was shown in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} that the leading \nterms in the expansion correspond to replacing the top quark loop by the effective $ggH$ vertex. Therefore we can\nobtain $V_I$ by calculating  the results in the effective field theory. \nWe write the one-loop amplitude as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n|\\mathcal{M}^{VI}\\rangle_{WH}= -C_F g_w^2 \\frac{\\alpha_s^2}{6\\pi^2 v}\\mathcal{P}_{W}(s_{34}) \\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_{VI}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_{VI}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)&=&\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{{\\langle 2  .\\rangle}3^2}{{\\langle 1  .\\rangle}2 {\\langle 3  .\\rangle}4} + \\frac{{[ 4 .]}1^2}{{[ 2 .]}1\\spb4.3}\\right){\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{2me}_{4F}}}(-s_{134},-s_{234};-s_{34},-s_{1234}) \\nonumber\\\\\n&&+\\left(\\frac{{\\langle 2  .\\rangle}3{[ 4 .]}1}{2{\\langle 1|.|P]}_{34}.1} - \\frac{\\spa1.2{\\langle 3  .\\rangle}4{[ 4 .]}1^2}{4{\\langle 1|.|P]}_{34}.1^2} \\right)\\log{\\left(\\frac{-s_{34}}{-s_{134}}\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\\n&&+\\left(\\frac{\\spa2.3\\spb4.1}{2\\spab2.P_{34}.2}-\\frac{\\spa2.3^2\\spb2.1\\spb4.3}{4\\spab2.P_{34}.2^2}\\right)\n\\log{\\left(\\frac{-s_{34}}{-s_{234}}\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\\n&&-\\frac{\\spa2.3^2\\spb2.1}{4\\spa3.4\\spab2.P_{34}.2}-\\frac{\\spa1.2\\spb4.1^2}{4\\spab1.P_{34}.1\\spb4.3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe finite part of the two-mass easy box is defined as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{2me}_{4F}}}(s,t;P^2,Q^2)&=&-2\\bigg[\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{s}\\bigg)\n+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{t}\\bigg)+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{Q^2}{s}\\bigg)\n\\nonumber\\\\&&+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{Q^2}{t}\\bigg)-\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2Q^2}{st}\\bigg)\n+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln^2\\bigg(\\frac{s}{t}\\bigg)\\bigg]\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\subsection{$V_{II}$ pieces} \n\nNext we consider the $V_{II}$ diagrams, in which the vector boson also couples to the closed fermion loop.\n(cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:ZHtop}, left).  These contributions therefore only exist for $ZH$ production.\nThe results of ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} show that the leading terms in the \n$m_t$ asymptotic expansion correspond to the $q\\overline{q}ZH$  effective vertex multiplying a two-loop massless\ntadpole diagram. The leading term in the expansion thus has the form of a tree-level amplitude \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n|\\mathcal{M}^{V_{II}}\\rangle_{ZH}=16\\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{4\\pi^2}G_F e m_W (v_L^t-v_R^t)\\sum_{i=L,R} \nv_i^{\\ell}\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{VII}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{VII}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)\n=\\frac{\\spb1.4\\spa3.2}{s_{34}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe $(v_L^t-v_R^t)$ factor arises since only the axial part of the two-loop massive tadpole contributes to the\namplitude. \n\n\\subsection{$R_I$ pieces} \n\nFinally we present the results for the $R_I$ contribution (cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:WHtop}, left). These contributions are\nuniversal and occur for either $WH$ or $ZH$ production. They correspond to one-loop calculations and can be\nperformed  either including the top quark mass in full, or in the effective field theory. The general structure of\nthe result is as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n|\\mathcal{M}^{R_{I}}\\rangle_{WH}= \\frac{g_s g_w^2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34}) \\mathcal{J}^{FT/EFT} \\sum_{h_5=\\pm 1} \n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{R_I}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{h_5},p_H)\\mathcal{I}^{FT/EFT}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe helicity amplitude is universal,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{R_I}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^+,p_H)&=&\n\\frac{\\spab3.P_{24}.5{\\langle 1|.|P]}_{234}.5\\spb4.2}{s_{1234}s_{234}s_{34}}\n       \\nonumber\\\\&&  +\\frac{\\spa1.3\\spb5.2\n     ({\\langle 1  .\\rangle}2{[ 4 .]}1\\spb5.2-\\spa2.3\\spb4.3\\spb5.2\n     +s_{134}\\spb5.4)}{s_{1234}s_{134}s_{34}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nbut the prefactor $\\mathcal{J}$ depends on whether one is in the full or the effective field theory, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{J}^{FT} &=& \\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{4\\pi} \\frac{m_t^2}{2m_W} g_w \\\\\n\\mathcal{J}^{EFT} &=& \\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{3\\pi v} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nFinally, the function $\\mathcal{I}$ is either equal to unity in the effective field theory or is a\ncombination of scalar loop integrals in the full theory,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{I}^{EFT}&=&1 \\\\\n\\mathcal{I}^{FT} &=& 8\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{4m_t^2}{s_{12345}-s_{1234}}\\right)I_3(s_{12345},s_{1234},m_t^2)\\\\&&  \n+\\frac{s_{1234}}{(s_{12345}-s_{1234})^2}\\left(I_2(s_{1234},m_t^2)-I_2(s_{12345},m_t^2)\\right)\n-\\frac{1}{s_{12345}-s_{1234}}\\bigg) \\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $I_3(s,t,m_t^2)$ and $I_2(s,m_t^2)$ represent the triangle with two massive external legs and the bubble\nintegral, respectively; in both cases the internal propagators have a common mass, $m_t$.\nIn the notation of the QCDLoop library~\\cite{Ellis:2007qk}, which we use to evaluate the integrals,\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 54453, "prevtext": "\nsuch that $d\\sigma^{\\mathrm{NLO}} = d\\sigma^{\\mathrm{NNLO}} - d(\\Delta\\sigma^{\\mathrm{NNLO}})$ defines the prediction that treats\nboth radiation in production and decay stages at the NLO level.\n\nRadiative corrections to the decay $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ were first\ncomputed over thirty years ago~\\cite{Braaten:1980yq}. It was shown that there\nare large differences between the partial width in a ``massless'' theory, in\nwhich the $b$-quark mass is kept in the Yukawa coupling but dropped in the\nmatrix element and phase space, and the full theory in which a non-zero\nbottom quark mass is retained throughout.\nThese large differences are the result of logarithms of the form\n$\\log{(m_b^2/m_H^2)}$ that can be absorbed into a re-definition of\n$m_b$ in the Yukawa coupling. As a result, if the running bottom quark mass\nis used then the massless and massive predictions are very similar. In our MCFM implementation we\nkeep the mass of the $b$-quark in full, and do not run the $b$-quark mass in the\nLO partial width. In order to ensure that the parts of the cross-section that\nare only exposed to a LO partial width are not susceptible  to the running mass\ncorrections, we divide out the partial width and normalize to the branching\nratio, $BR(H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b})$.  In this way we can also take advantage\nof advanced theoretical predictions for this branching ratio, which\nis now known to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^4)$~\\cite{Baikov:2005rw}.  In our MCFM implementation \nwe use the value obtained from the HDECAY code~\\cite{Djouadi:1997yw}. We note that, although we do not\ncurrently include effects beyond NLO in the decay, differential calculations for these\nquantities have been presented in the massless theory~\\cite{Anastasiou:2011qx,DelDuca:2015zqa}.  \n\n\n\n\\section{LHC Phenomenology }\n\\label{sec:pheno}\n\nIn this section we study the phenomenology of the $VH$ processes at\nNNLO for the LHC Run II. For the larger rate $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ decay we present results \nwhich can be compared to data collected with the current operating energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. For the rarer \n$H\\rightarrow WW^*$ and $H\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ processes we instead focus on predictions which may be\ncompared with a larger data set obtained in a future $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV run. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOur predictions are obtained using the default MCFM EW scheme, which\ncorresponds to the following parameter choices: $m_W=80.398$ GeV, $m_Z=91.1876$ GeV,\n$\\Gamma_W=2.1054$ GeV, $\\Gamma_Z =2.4952$ GeV, $G_F=1.16639 \\times\n10^{-5}$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $m_t=172$ GeV.   These are sufficient to determine\nthe remaining EW parameters.  We use\n$m_b=4.75$~GeV and set the CKM matrix elements $V_{ud} = 0.975$ and\n$V_{cs} = 0.222$.  Jets are clustered using the anti-$k_T$ jet algorithm\nwith distance parameter $R=0.4$. Unless otherwise stated, we use the CT14 pdf\nsets~\\cite{Dulat:2015mca} matched to the appropriate order in\nperturbation theory. Our default renormalization and factorization\nscale choice is $\\mu_R=\\mu_F=\\mu_0$ with $\\mu_0=m_V+m_H$.\n\n\n\nAt NNLO the dependence on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales is rather mild, especially  for\n$q\\overline{q}$ initiated processes such as those under consideration here. As a result any prescription for estimating the\nscale uncertainty, for instance by varying both scales in the same direction or varying them in opposite directions, yields\nsimilar results.  However since the $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ decay is computed at NLO, a larger scale dependence for this\ndecay is observed, with the largest deviations at NNLO (for $WH$) arising from the  case where the scales are varied in opposite\ndirections.  We will therefore present results obtained with\n$ \\mu_R = k \\mu_0$ and $\\mu_F = \\mu_0 / k$, with $k = 1/2$ and $k = 2$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Results: $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$}\n\\label{sec:Hbb}\n\n\nIn this section we present our results for LHC phenomenology for the $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$ decay. \nWe will study a variety of phase space selection criteria, with cuts inspired by the ATLAS~\\cite{Aad:2014xzb} and CMS~\\cite{Chatrchyan:2013zna}\nexperiments. We define the following set of basic cuts,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n{\\rm{Jets : }}&& \\quad  p_T^j > 25 \\; {\\rm{GeV}}, \\;  |\\eta_{j} | < 2.5  \\label{eq:basid1}\n \\\\\n{\\rm{Leptons :}}&& \\quad p_T^{\\ell} > 25 \\; {\\rm{GeV}}, \\; |\\eta_{\\ell} | < 2.5 \n \\\\\n{{WH :}}&& \\quad \\slashed{E}_T > 20 \\;  {\\rm{GeV}},  \\; m_T^W  < 120 \\; {\\rm{GeV}} \\\\\n{{ZH :}}&& \\quad 80 <  \\; m_{\\ell\\ell}  < 100 \\; {\\rm{GeV}} \\label{eq:basid2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\n\n\n\\includegraphics[width=12cm]{tauWpH.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=12cm]{tauWmH.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=12cm]{tauZH.pdf} \n\\caption{The $\\tau$-dependence of the NNLO coefficient for the $VH$ processes,\nunder the $H \\to b{\\bar b}$ cuts of Section~\\ref{sec:Hbb}.}\n\\label{fig:tauHbb}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\nBefore proceeding with our phenomenological study, we must first specify\nthe value of $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ that will be used throughout the remainder\nof this paper.  Although a detailed study of the implementation of $VH$\nproduction using $N$-jettiness subtraction in MCFM will be detailed in\nref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}\\footnote{In that paper we validate the general method by comparing\nour results to those obtained using the public code\n{\\tt{vh@nnlo}}~\\cite{Brein:2003wg,Brein:2012ne}.\n\nWe therefore refer the reader to the discussion in that paper for a validation of the general implementation.},\nit is useful to revisit the discussion in the\ncontext of the cuts specified in Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:basid1})--(\\ref{eq:basid2}).\nThe $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$-dependence of the NNLO coefficient in the expansion of\nthe cross-section under these cuts ($\\Delta\\sigma^{NNLO}$), computed for the $14$~TeV LHC,  is shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:tauHbb}.  The remaining dependence on $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ is a result of power corrections,\nwhose form can be fitted according to the solid lines in the figure. The dashed lines indicate the fitting errors\non the asymptotic result for $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}} \\to 0$.\nFurther details on this fitting procedure can be found in ref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}.  It is clear that for $WH$ production\n$\\Delta\\sigma^{NNLO}$ is independent of $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ at the level of a few\npercent for $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}} \\lesssim 0.01$.  For $ZH$ production the same\nvalue of $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ yields an accuracy of about $0.5\\%$ in the\ncoefficient, where, as we will see shortly, the improvement is due to the fact that this process receives\na larger $y_t$ contribution that does not depend on $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$.\nThe accuracy of the prediction for the NNLO cross-section\ncan be assessed by combining this information with the order-by-order\nresults that are shown in Table~\\ref{table:VHbb}.  It is thus clear that\nchoosing $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}=0.01$ is sufficient for per-mille accuracy in the full\nNNLO prediction for all processes.  We shall make this choice henceforth.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nProcess & $\\sigma_{LO} $ [fb] & $\\sigma_{NLO}$ [fb] & $\\sigma_{NNLO}$ [fb] & $\\Delta\\sigma_{NNLO}$ [fb]  \\\\\n\\hline\\hline \n$W^+H\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\nu b \\bar b$     & 19.79 & 20.18 & 20.71 & 0.52 \\\\\n\\hline\n$W^-H\\rightarrow \\ell^-\\bar\\nu b \\bar b$ & 14.14 & 14.24 & 14.57 & 0.33 \\\\\n\\hline\n$ZH\\rightarrow \\ell^-\\ell^+ b \\bar b$    & 5.05  & 5.11  & 5.94  & 0.83 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cross-sections for $VH$ processes, with leptonic decay of the vector bosons and $H \\to b{\\bar b}$,\nat the 14 TeV LHC.

The left-hand plot illustrates the total rate at NLO\n(dashed) and NNLO (solid) for $WH$ and $ZH$ production.\nWe plot the cross-section for $W^+(\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\nu)H$ and\n$W^-(\\rightarrow \\ell^-\\overline{\\nu})H$ separately.  At the LHC the\nproduction of $W^+H$ is dominant, since the $u\\overline{d}$ initial state\nconfiguration has a larger flux than $d\\overline{u}$ for $pp$\ncollisions. The plots on the right hand side show the NNLO\ncoefficient, $\\Delta\\sigma^{NNLO}$. The upper and middle panels present\nresults for $W^+H$ and $W^-H$ production. The NNLO corrections in both\ncases are similar. It is interesting to compare the size of the top\ninduced cross-section $\\sigma^{(2),y_t}_{VH}$ to the total NNLO\ncoefficient. For $WH$ production the top induced pieces, after\ncuts, make up around 30-50\\% of the total $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$\ncorrection.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{xsbas.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section in femtobarns as a function of the operating energy $\\sqrt{s}$ of the LHC. The basic selection\ncuts described in the text are applied. The right-hand plots  show the size of the NNLO coefficient, on each plot the\ncontribution from the top induced couplings is shown in grey. The shaded bands illustrate the scale-dependence,\ncomputed as described in the text.}\n\\label{fig:xsbas}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe $Z$ boson has a much smaller branching ratio to a single family of\nleptons compared to the $W$, so the cross-sections presented in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:xsbas} for $\\ell^+\\ell^- b\\overline{b}$ are smaller than\nthe corresponding $W$ induced ones (for instance, compared to the\ninclusive results presented in ref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}). The NNLO\ncorrections are also much more important for $ZH$ production than for $WH$. This\nis due to the large contribution from the $gg\\rightarrow ZH$\npieces. The importance of the gluon flux at the LHC \ncan help to offset the $\\alpha_S$ suppression, resulting in a NNLO correction\nwhose impact is more comparable to a NLO effect. This is\nclearly visible in the lowest plot on the right-hand side of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:xsbas}, in which only the NNLO coefficient is\nshown. By far the dominant source of the correction arises from\n$\\sigma^{(2),y_t}_{ZH}$ and not $\\sigma^{(2),DY}_{ZH}$.  Of the\n$\\sigma^{(2),y_t}_{ZH}$ contribution the dominant effect is induced by the $gg$\ndiagrams, although it is not possible to separate them from the\n$V_{i}$ and $R_{i}$ pieces at this order in perturbation theory.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{WpHptV.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{WmHptV.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section in femtobarns as a function of the minimum transverse momentum of the $W^+$ (left) and $W^-$ (right) boson, $p_T^W$.

In\norder to reduce the backgrounds from top, diboson and $V+$ jets processes, cuts\non the transverse momentum of the vector boson are usually employed in\nexperimental analyses. We therefore investigate the total cross\nsection as a function of the minimum transverse momentum of the vector\nboson in Figs.~\\ref{fig:ptWxs} $(WH)$ and~\\ref{fig:ptZxs} $(ZH)$.  We\nfocus on the LHC operating at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. To produce these\nresults we apply the basic cuts described above. The results of\nthe previous figures are also manifest in these plots: the initial\nimpact of higher order corrections for $W^-H$ is slightly larger (at\nNLO), but the impact of the NNLO corrections is similar for both\ncharges in $W^{\\pm}H$.  It is also clear that $ZH$ has much larger\nNNLO corrections than $WH$. Particularly rich signal bins in the\nexperimental analysis correspond to $p_T^V > 120$~GeV and $p_T^V > 160$~GeV.\nFor these choices the signal cross-section is around 30-40\\% and $15-20\\%$ of the $p_T^V$-inclusive result,\nrespectively. The impact of NLO is a mild\nenhancement in the tail of the $p_T^V$ distribution for all process.  For\n$WH$ production the NNLO corrections are reasonably flat in $p_T^V$,\nwhile the NNLO corrections to the $ZH$ process become more pronounced in the high $p_T^V$ region.\nThis is due almost exclusively to the $y_t$ correction, which hardens the spectrum as can be clearly seen in the middle panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:ptZxs}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHnj0V.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHnj120V.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section in femtobarns as a function of the number of jets (light plus $b$-jets) for $W^+H$ at 13 TeV.

In\nFigure~\\ref{fig:njetsWp} we present the cross-section as a function of\nthe total number of jets (i.e. $b$-jets plus light jets). The plot on\nthe left-hand side has only the basic lepton cuts applied, while on\nthe right $p_T^V > 120$~GeV is required in addition to the basic\nlepton cuts.  Since the Higgs boson is a resonance decaying to massive\nquarks, a well-defined cross-section can be computed without any\nrequirement on the number of $b$-jets present.  An N$^{n}$LO\nprediction can then have between 0 and $(n+2)$ jets in the final\nstate, with the $(n+2)$-jet bin corresponding to the LO prediction for\n$VH+n$ jets. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:njetsWp} we present NLO and NNLO\npredictions, with NLO (solid) and LO (dashed) $H\\rightarrow\nb\\overline{b}$ decays. As expected the largest scale variation occurs\nin the four-jet bin (NNLO) and three-jet bin (NLO) predictions, since\nthese are LO predictions in this observable. Including the decay has a\nsignificant impact on the jet counting, particularly in the two- and\nthree-jet bins where it changes the predicted rate by\n$\\mathcal{O}(20\\%)$. The higher $p_T^V$ selection has relatively more\nthree-jet events than the more inclusive selection, which arises from\nthe kinematic favorability of balancing a high $p_T$ vector boson with\na jet and the Higgs boson. The Higgs decay at LO has no dependence on\n$\\alpha_S$ and therefore no scale dependence. When we introduce the\ndecay at NLO we include $\\alpha_S$ for the first time, and acquire a\nlarger dependence on the choice of scale.  Reducing the scale\ndependence further requires consideration of NNLO effects in the decay\nstage~\\cite{Anastasiou:2011qx,DelDuca:2015zqa}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHptbh.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{WpHptbb.pdf} \n\\caption{Differential predictions for the transverse momenta of the hardest $b$ (left) and the $b\\overline{b}$ system (right)\nfor $W^+H$ at the LHC.

We\npresent differential distributions for the hardest $b$-jet (left) and\n$p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}$ (right), applying the basic lepton cuts,\ndemanding two $b$-jets and enforcing $p_T^V > 120$~GeV.  The general impact of\nincluding the higher order corrections in the decay is immediately\napparent as a general softening of both spectra. This is easily\nunderstood from the decay kinematics.   The invariant mass of the\nsystem is constrained to be very close to $m_H^2$. When there are three particles\npresent in the decay to share the energy, the result is a softer\nspectrum. For $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}$ the impact of higher order\ncorrections in production and decay are particularly important. At LO,\n$p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}=p_{T}^{V}$ so that the cut on the vector\nboson momentum is also a cut on $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}}$. At NLO this is\nno longer necessarily the case, since the real corrections allow for\nan unclustered parton to balance the total momentum. Therefore the\nregion $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}} < 120$~GeV is first accessible at\nNLO. Since in this region of phase space the total transverse momentum\nof the $b\\overline{b}$ is by definition relatively small, the resulting\ntransverse momentum of the $b$-quark pair is also relatively soft. As\na result the region of phase space where $p_T^b$(hard)~$<120$~GeV also\nhas large higher order corrections. This is highlighted in the middle\npanel of the figures which presents the impact of higher order\ncorrections in production (for NLO decays).  Going from LO to NLO\nthere are large corrections to the $p_T$ spectrum of the\nhardest $b$ quark, however the NNLO prediction is relatively stable\nillustrating that the perturbative expansion is well-behaved beyond\nLO. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor $p_T^{b\\overline{b}}$ there is a strong feature\nat the edge of the phase space for the NLO decays that is not present for the\nLO decay option. This is due to the phase space boundary at the LO threshold in the decay phase space~\\cite{Frixione:1997ks}.\nThe virtual decay corrections reside in the $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}} > 120$ GeV region of phase space, whilst the real \ncorrections $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b} g$ can \nfill the region both above and below this value. However in the real phase space when $p_{T}^{b\\overline{b}} = 120$~GeV\nthere is a restriction on the phase space  for soft gluon emission and a large logarithm arises. \nBoundary problems such as these occur frequently in perturbation theory~\\cite{Frixione:1997ks} and have been observed for\nthis specific process in previous calculations~\\cite{Ferrera:2013yga,Ferrera:2014lca}.\nFor $ZH$ production the spectrum is smoothed-out somewhat by the turn-on of the $gg\\rightarrow ZH$ contribution,\nwhich resides  in the Born phase space. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Results: $H\\rightarrow WW^*\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\nu\\ell^-\\overline{\\nu}$}\n\nThe decay $H\\rightarrow\nWW^*$ represents a significant fraction, about $20\\%$, of the total decay rate. Although requiring\nleptonic decays of the $W$ bosons reduces the rate further, the signal cross\nsections are large enough to have warranted experimental investigation in Run I\nof the LHC~\\cite{Aad:2015ona}. Going forward into Run II, triboson signatures represent a\nfresh environment in which to search for new physics. From the technical point of view the $2\\rightarrow 8$  phase\nspace is large, corresponding to a 22-dimensional Monte Carlo integration in the double-real part\nof the calculation. This therefore represents a\ndemanding application of the $N$-jettiness subtraction technique that tests its\nsuitability for complex phenomenological studies at NNLO. \nWe study the production of $VH(\\rightarrow WW^*)$ at the 14 TeV LHC with the following simple\nphase space selection criteria,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n{\\rm{Jets : }}&& \\quad  p_T^j > 25 \\; {\\rm{GeV}}, \\;  |\\eta_{j} | < 2.5  \\\\\n{\\rm{Leptons :}}&& \\quad p_T^{\\ell} > 25 \\; {\\rm{GeV}}, \\; |\\eta_{\\ell} | < 2.5 \\\\\n{\\rm{MET: }} &&  \\quad \\slashed{E}_T > 20 \\;  {\\rm{GeV}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nResults for the cross-sections obtained under these cuts are presented in Table~\\ref{table:VHWW}.\nWe present results for a single family of leptons for each  $V$ decay. Including all possibilities\nof electron and muon configurations would thus increase the total rates presented in the table by\na factor of eight. We do not consider any interference between the  leptons arising from the decay of\nthe associated vector boson and those arising from the Higgs boson decay. The primary aim of this section is to address the\nfeasibility of producing NNLO results using the SCET subtraction for a high-dimensional final\nstate configuration. We therefore postpone the treatment of interference effects for a future\nstudy.\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nProcess & $\\sigma^{VH}_{LO} $ [fb] & $\\sigma^{VH}_{NLO}$ [fb] & $\\sigma^{VH}_{NNLO}$ [fb]  \\\\\n\\hline\\hline \n$W^+H\\rightarrow \\ell_1^+\\ell^+_{2}\\ell_3^- +\\slashed{E}_T$   & 0.0293$^{+0.9\\%}_{-3.8\\%}$    &   0.0394$_{-3.1\\%}^{+2.3\\%}$ & 0.0412$^{+1.6\\%}_{-0.9\\%}$   \\\\\n\\hline\n$W^-H\\rightarrow \\ell_1^-\\ell^+_{2}\\ell_3^- +\\slashed{E}_T$     &  0.0180$^{+3.0\\%}_{-3.8\\%}$ &  0.0250$_{-2.4\\%}^{+1.6\\%}$ & 0.0261$^{+0.6\\%}_{-0.5\\%}$   \\\\\n\\hline\n$ZH\\rightarrow \\ell_1^+\\ell_1^- \\ell^+_2 \\ell_3^- +\\slashed{E}_T$ &  0.00634$_{-3.3\\%}^{+2.4\\%}$   & 0.00854$_{-1.9\\%}^{+2.7\\%}$   &  0.0104$^{+2.1\\%}_{-2.1\\%}$    \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cross-sections for $VH \\rightarrow VWW^* \\rightarrow $ leptons at the 14 TeV LHC.\nResults are presented for a single family of leptons.}\n\\label{table:VHWW}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\nAn important variable when considering the decay $H \\to WW^*$ is the transverse mass\nof the electroweak final state.  For the $WH$ process it is defined by,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \nm^{WH}_T = \\sqrt{(E_T^{3\\ell}+\\slashed{E}_T)^2-|{\\bf{p}}_T^{3\\ell}+{\\bf{\\slashed{E}_T}}|^2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nE_T^{3\\ell} = \\sqrt{{|{\\bf{p}}_T^{3\\ell}|}^2+m_{3\\ell}^2} \\;.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe equivalent definition for $ZH$ production ($m^{ZH}_T$) is obtained by making\nthe replacement $3\\ell\\rightarrow 4\\ell$. \nThe transverse mass is important since it can be used as a proxy for $m_{VH}$, which\nis not experimentally observable for $H\\rightarrow WW^*$ decays. \nThe study of this variable is interesting due to its sensitivity to high-energy\nstructures that may be present in the $HVV$ vertex in BSM scenarios.  For instance,\ntreating the SM as an EFT introduces six- (and higher-) dimensional operators that induce\nmomentum dependent couplings between the Higgs and the vector bosons\\footnote{A study of these operators \nat NLO (+PS) in the MCFM framework was presented recently in ref.~\\cite{Mimasu:2015nqa}.}.  In general these operators\nwill induce small deviations in the tails of the transverse mass distribution, so it is crucial to have\ncontrol over percent-level effects from the SM in this region. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{mvhww_WpH} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{mvhww_ZH} \n\\caption{Differential predictions for the transverse mass of the lepton-$\\slashed{E}_T$ system for $W^+H$(left) and\n$ZH$ (right) production at the 14 TeV LHC. }\n\\label{fig:mtransvh}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nOur predictions for this observable are presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:mtransvh} for $W^+H$ (left) and\n$ZH$ (right). We note that, although the cross sections presented in Table~\\ref{table:VHWW} are obtained with $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}=0.01$~GeV, we present differential \ndistributions obtained with a slightly larger value, $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}=0.04$~GeV.  This choice is made in order to obtain smoother predictions for distributions and,\ngiven the results of section~\\ref{sec:Hbb} and ref.~\\cite{Inprep2015}, we expect any difference to be negligible. \nFrom Fig.~\\ref{fig:mtransvh} the difference in shape between $m^{WH}_T$  ($W^+H$ left) and $m^{ZH}_T$   ($ZH$ right) is apparent. Since\nthe transverse mass for $ZH$ is closer in definition\nto $m_{VH}$, it has a\nmuch harder spectrum, whereas $m^{WH}_T$ is much softer. The higher-order\ncorrections for $ZH$ are much larger, primarily due to the significant $gg\\rightarrow ZH$ contribution.\nThese pieces \nare sensitive to the $2 m_{t}$ thresholds present in the loop integrals, and as a result turn on\nat $m^{ZH}_T \\sim 300$ GeV.  In this region the NNLO corrections are much larger\nand the shape of $m^{ZH}_T$ is significantly altered. It is therefore essential\nto include NNLO predictions for this observable in order to avoid attributing any observed change\nin shape to the presence of BSM physics. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{njets_WHWW.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{njets_ZHWW.pdf} \n\\caption{The cross-section as a function of the number of jets, $n_{j}$, for $W^+H$ (left) and $ZH$ (right) with $H\\rightarrow WW^*$ decays at the 14 TeV LHC}\n\\label{fig:njHWW}\n\\end{center} \n\\end{figure}\n\nFinally in Fig.~\\ref{fig:njHWW} we present the cross-section as a function of the number of additional jets,\nwhere the basic jet definition is used from the previous section, $p_T^j > 25$ GeV and $|\\eta_{j}| < 2.5$. The\n$n_{j}$ distribution for these decays are different from those studied previously in the $H\\rightarrow\nb\\overline{b}$ section, since now the jets are only produced through initial state radiation, with no\ncontamination from jets arising from the decay.

For $ZH$ production the percentage drops to around 35\\% due to the presence of the\n$gg\\rightarrow ZH$ contribution that only populates the 0-jet bin.\n\n\n\\subsection{Results: $H\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\vskip 0.5cm\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nProcess & $\\sigma^{VH}_{LO} $ [fb] & $\\sigma^{VH}_{NLO}$ [fb] & $\\sigma^{VH}_{NNLO}$ [fb] &$\\sigma^{\\rm{Back}}_{LO,m_{\\gamma\\gamma}}$ \\\\\n\\hline\\hline \n$\\ell^+\\nu\\gamma\\gamma$   & 0.0686$^{+3.0\\%}_{-3.7\\%}$  &  0.0860$^{+2.2\\%}_{-2.4\\%}$  \n\n & $0.0891^{+0.2\\%}_{-0.8\\%}$ \n & 0.0459$^{+1.9\\%}_{-2.4\\%}$   \\\\\n\\hline\n$\\ell^-\\overline{\\nu}\\gamma\\gamma$  & 0.0448$^{+3.2\\%}_{-3.9\\%}$  &  0.0579$^{+2.3\\%}_{-2.4\\%}$ \n\n & $0.0603^{+0.2\\%}_{-1.0\\%}$ \n & 0.0324$^{+2.7\\%}_{-3.9\\%}$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$ \\ell^+\\ell^-\\gamma\\gamma $ & 0.0177$^{+3.1\\%}_{-3.9\\%}$    &  0.0224$^{+2.2\\%}_{-2.4\\%}$\n\n & $0.0256^{+2.0\\%}_{-1.6\\%}$ \n & 0.0555$^{+1.6\\%}_{-4.6\\%}$    \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\n\\caption{Cross-sections for $V\\gamma\\gamma$ production at the 14 TeV LHC, for a single family of leptons.\n\nThe corresponding phase space selection criteria are described in the text.}\n\\label{table:VHgaga}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\nThe decay $H\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ provides a relatively clean experimental signature, at the cost of a very small branching ratio.

These two contributions are comparable in size for $WH$ production.  For the $ZH$ process\nthe latter corrections involve $gg$-initiated diagrams that dominate the NNLO correction.  Including both contributions is\ntherefore imperative and our calculation enables the combined effects to be studied in a differential manner for the\nfirst time.   Analytic results for these amplitudes can be found in the appendix and the distributed MCFM code.  \n\nThe $VH$ processes are among the most interesting Higgs production modes for phenomenological studies in Run II.\nWe have therefore studied a number of decay modes of the Higgs boson in some detail.  In the case of the\ndecay to a pair of bottom quarks, $H\\rightarrow b\\overline{b}$, we have also included the effect of radiation in the \ndecay at NLO accuracy.  This has a considerable impact on, for instance, the transverse momentum of the $b\\bar b$ pair.\nOur results suggest that including QCD corrections in the decay to NNLO is important, although it is beyond the scope\nof this paper.  We have investigated the phenomenology of other Higgs decay channels that might be explored more fully\nin Run II of the LHC, namely the decays  $H\\rightarrow WW^* \\rightarrow$ leptons and $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$.\n\n\nFrom the theoretical point of view, presenting a NNLO\ncalculation for the $2\\rightarrow 6$ process, $pp \\to VH \\to VWW^* \\to$~leptons+$\\slashed{E}_T$ is technically\nchallenging due to the large final state phase space. In the double-real part\nof the calculation the phase space is 22-dimensional, and provides a challenging environment in which to test the jettiness-based\napproach to NNLO calculations.  The $H\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ decay results in very small cross-sections, but has the advantage\nthat the irreducible background in the neighborhood of the Higgs boson mass is also small, resulting in comparable signal and\nbackground rates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of this paper have been implemented into MCFM, and will be made available in a forthcoming release of the code. \n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\n\nWe thank Radja Boughezal, Xiaohui Liu and Frank Petriello for assisting in the implementation\nof the $N$-jettiness regularization procedure in MCFM. \nCW thanks Shawn Matott for computational help and JC is grateful to the Fermilab computing sector for\nproviding access to the Accelerator Simulations Cluster.\nFermilab is supported by the US DOE under contract DE-AC02-07CH11359.

We present results for  contributions above and below\n$\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ separately. Since the Higgs boson is a scalar particle the decay amplitude\nfactorizes from  the production amplitude, modulo ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ corrections that we\nneglect in our calculation. Therefore the results in this section are presented for an on-shell\nHiggs boson and a $V$ boson that decays to leptons are included.  We have used the Mathematica\npackage S@M~\\cite{Maitre:2007jq} frequently in our calculations. \n\n\n\\subsection{Below $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$}\n\nBelow $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ the calculation requires the soft, beam, and hard functions of the SCET\nformalism.  The required soft and beam functions can be found in, for example,\nref.~\\cite{Gaunt:2015pea}. The process-dependent  hard-function can be extracted from the two-loop virtual \nform-factor as outlined in refs.~\\cite{Becher:2009cu,Becher:2009qa}. We have repeated the  calculation\nand for completeness we reproduce the $1$- and $2-$loop results below, \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}\\right\\rangle_{\\overline{MS}} &=& C_F\\left(\\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{2\\pi}\\right) \\left(-L^2-3L+8-\\zeta_2\\right)|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rangle \\\\\n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(2)}\\right\\rangle_{\\overline{MS}} &=&\\left(\\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 \\bigg[C_F^2\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}(L^2-3L+8-\\zeta_2)^2 \\nonumber\\\\&&\n      +\\left(\\frac{3}{2}-12\\zeta_2+24\\zeta_3\\right)L \n      -\\frac{1}{8}+29\\zeta_2-30\\zeta_3-\\frac{44}{5}\\zeta_2^2\\bigg) \\nonumber\\\\&&\n      +C_FN_f\\bigg(-\\frac{2}{9}L^3+\\frac{19}{9}L^2-\\left(\\frac{209}{27}+\\frac{4}{3}\\zeta_2\\right)L\n     +\\frac{4085}{324}+\\frac{23}{9}\\zeta_2+\\frac{2}{9}\\zeta_3\\bigg)\\nonumber\\\\&&\n     +C_FC_A\\bigg(\\frac{11}{9}L^3+\\left(2\\zeta_2-\\frac{233}{18}\\right)L^2\n      +\\left(\\frac{2545}{54}+\\frac{22}{3}\\zeta_2-26\\zeta_3\\right)L\\nonumber\\\\&&\n      -\\frac{51157}{648}-\\zeta_2\\left(\\frac{337}{18}-\\frac{44}{5}\\zeta_2\\right)+\\frac{313}{9}\\zeta_3\\bigg)\\bigg]\n      \\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\right\\rangle\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $L=\\log{\\left({-s_{12}}/{\\mu^2}\\right)}$ and $\\left|M^{(0)}\\right\\rangle$\nrepresents the LO amplitude. Note that the above amplitudes are defined in four-dimensions\nand as such the LO amplitude (for $WH$ production) can be defined in terms of helicity\namplitudes as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\right\\rangle_{WH}=g_W^3 m_W \\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34})\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},4^-_{\\ell},p_H)\n\\end{eqnarray} \nIn the above equation $\\mathcal{P}$ represents the propagator function, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{P}_X(s) = \\frac{s}{s-m_X^2+i m_X\\Gamma_X} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe tree-level helicity amplitude is then defined as follows\\footnote{We refer readers unfamiliar with spinor-helicity notation to one of the many \ncomprehensive reviews, for instance ref.~\\cite{Dixon:1996wi}}, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},4^-_{\\ell},p_H)= \\frac{\\spa1.4{[ 3 .]}2}{s_{34}s_{12}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIt is instructive to re-write this amplitude as, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},4^-_{\\ell},p_H)= -\\frac{1}{s_{12}}\\left(\\frac{{\\langle 1  .\\rangle}4^2}{{\\langle 1  .\\rangle}2\\spa3.4}+\\frac{\\spa1.4{\\langle 1|.|p]}_H.3}{\\spa1.2 s_{34}}\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nModulo the overall factor of $s_{12}$, which is a result of the internal $W$ propagator function,\nthe holomorphic piece of the above expression (the first term) corresponds exactly to the  MHV\ntree-level amplitude for $q\\overline{q}\\ell\\overline{\\nu}$. The second, non-holomorphic, term\nis a correction that vanishes in the soft Higgs boson limit. Since the amplitudes for $W+3$\nand $W+4$ partons have been calculated analytically~\\cite{Giele:1991vf,Bern:1997sc} the above\ndecomposition provides a useful check of all of our calculated amplitudes.\n\nThe helicity breakdown for the $ZH$ process requires a summation over the left and right-handed couplings \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\left|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\right\\rangle_{ZH}=2\\frac{g_W e^2}{\\cos^2\\theta_W}m_W \\mathcal{P}_H(s_{1234})\\mathcal{P}_Z(s_{34})\n\\sum_{ij = L,R} v^{q}_{i}v^{\\ell}_{i} \\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{ij}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nThe fermionic (quark or lepton) coupling to the $Z$ boson is given by $v_{h}^{(q,\\ell)}$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nv_{L}^{\\ell}=\\frac{-1-2Q_{\\ell}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \\quad v_{R}^{\\ell}=-\\frac{2Q_{\\ell}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \\nonumber\\\\\nv_{L}^{q}=\\frac{\\pm1-2Q_{q}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \\quad v_{R}^{q}=-\\frac{2Q_{q}\\sin^2\\theta_W}{\\sin2\\theta_W} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe sign in the $v_{L}^{q}$ term is determined by whether the quark is up ($+$) or down ($-$)\ntype. The helicity amplitudes are then obtained from the equivalent amplitudes for the $WH$\nprocess, by applying line reversal symmetries as necessary.\n\n\n\\subsection{Above $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$}\n\nAbove $\\tau^{\\mbox{\\tiny{cut}}}$ the calculation corresponds to a NLO one for the $VH +$ jet process. We have\ncalculated helicity amplitudes for this process which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been\npresented in the literature before. The LO amplitude for $WHj$ can be written as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n|\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rangle_{WHj} =\\sqrt{2}g_s g_W^3 m_W (T^{g_5})^{i_1}_{j_2} \\;\\mathcal{P}_H(s_{12345})\\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34})\n\\sum_{h_5=\\pm1}\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{h_5},p_H) \\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray} \nThe tree-level MHV helicity amplitude is  defined as, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_4(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{+},p_H)=-\\frac{\\spa1.3\\spab1.P_{25}.4}{s_{125}s_{34}\\spa1.5\\spa2.5}\n\\label{eq:A0WHj}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $P_{25}=p_2+p_5$.  The helicity amplitude for $h_5=-1$ can be readily obtained from the above by the conjugation operation. \nAt NLO we require the one-loop amplitude for $WHj$ and the tree-level amplitudes for $WHjj$. The one-loop amplitude for $WHj$ can be written as follows, \n \\begin{eqnarray} \n|\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}\\rangle_{WHj} &=&\\sqrt{2}g_s g_W^3 m_W N_c (T^{g_5})^{i_1}_{j_2} \\;\\mathcal{P}_H(s_{12345})\\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34})\n\\\\&\\times&\n\\sum_{h_5=\\pm1}\\bigg(\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_1(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{+},p_H) + \\frac{1}{N_c^2}\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_2(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{+},p_H)\\bigg)\n\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}   \nAs discussed in the previous subsection, the amplitudes for $VHj$ can be decomposed in terms of those for $Vj$ and a piece which vanishes in the soft limit (where it is understood that momentum conservation is altered accordingly in the $Vj$ amplitude). We use this decomposition on our one-loop amplitudes, defining, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_i\n =V_i  \\mathcal{A}^{(0)}+F_i + S^H_i\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}$ is understood to be given by eq.~\\eqref{eq:A0WHj}. $V_i$ and $F_i$ then correspond\nexactly to the amplitudes obtained in the calculation of the $W+3$ parton one-loop amplitude, and $S_i^H$\ncorresponds to the missing piece which vanishes in the soft Higgs limit. For brevity we do not reproduce the results\nfor $V_i$ and $F_i$ here, they can be found in the literature~\\cite{Bern:1997sc} or in the distributed MCFM code.\nThe leading colour contribution $S^H_1$ has the following form, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n S^H_1 = -\\frac{3\\spa2.1\\spab3.P_{125}.4\\spb5.2}{2s_{125}^2\\spa2.5}L_0(-s_{25},-s_{125})\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhile the subleading colour contribution $S^2_H$ is \n \\begin{eqnarray}\nS^H_2&=&\\frac{\\spa1.2{\\langle 3|.|P]}_{125}.4 }{s_{125}\\spa1.5^2}{\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{1m}_{4F}}}(-s_{12},-s_{25};-s_{125})         \n \\nonumber\\\\&& +\n\\frac{\\spa1.2\\spb5.1{\\langle 3|.|P]}_{125}.4}{s_{125}\\spa1.5}\\left(    \\frac{L_0(-s_{125},-s_{25})}{s_{25}}-\\frac{L_0(-s_{125},-s_{12})}{s_{12}}\\right)\n \\nonumber\\\\&&-\\frac{\\spb5.1{\\langle 3|.|P]}_{125}.4}{s_{125}\\spa1.5\\spb2.1}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n Here ${\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{1m}_{4F}}}$ represents the finite part of the one-mass box integral and is given by, \n \\begin{eqnarray}\n {\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{1m}_{4F}}}(s,t;P^2) = -2\\left(\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{s}\\bigg)+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{t}\\bigg)+\\frac{1}{2}\\log^2\\left(\\frac{s}{t}\\right)\n +\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray} \n and the auxiliary function $L_0(s,t)$ is,\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n L_0(s,t)=\\frac{\\log{s/t}}{1-s/t}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n The amplitudes for $ZH$ production can be obtained in similar fashion to the tree-level discussion in the previous\n sub-section, i.e. by appropriate dressing of the helicity amplitudes by the left- and right-handed couplings and\n modification of the electroweak pre-factor accordingly. \n\n\\section{Amplitudes for $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ $y_t$ contributions} \n\n\\label{app:ytamp}\n\nIn this section we present formulae for some of the amplitudes that contribute to the term\n$d\\sigma^{(2),y_t}$.  There are in principle five such terms, labelled in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} as $V_I$, $V_{II}$,\n$R_{I}$, $R_{II}$ and $gg$-initiated pieces.  In this section we follow closely the formalism and nomenclature used in that reference,\nwhich presents these contributions for on-shell bosons.  Here we do not include any results for $R_{II}$ since its\neffects are tiny and not accounted-for in our calculation.  We also do not present our analytic results for the\n$gg \\to ZH$ contribution, which are too lengthy to include here but may be inspected in the distributed MCFM code. \n\n\\subsection{$V_I$ pieces}\n\nWe begin by considering the $V_I$ pieces, which occur for both $W$ and $Z$ associated production\n(cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:WHtop}, right). Using the method of asymptotic \nexpansions\\footnote{see, for example, the discussion in refs.~\\cite{Smirnov:1994tg,Harlander:1999cs}} it was shown in ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} that the leading \nterms in the expansion correspond to replacing the top quark loop by the effective $ggH$ vertex. Therefore we can\nobtain $V_I$ by calculating  the results in the effective field theory. \nWe write the one-loop amplitude as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n|\\mathcal{M}^{VI}\\rangle_{WH}= -C_F g_w^2 \\frac{\\alpha_s^2}{6\\pi^2 v}\\mathcal{P}_{W}(s_{34}) \\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_{VI}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}_{VI}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)&=&\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{{\\langle 2  .\\rangle}3^2}{{\\langle 1  .\\rangle}2 {\\langle 3  .\\rangle}4} + \\frac{{[ 4 .]}1^2}{{[ 2 .]}1\\spb4.3}\\right){\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{2me}_{4F}}}(-s_{134},-s_{234};-s_{34},-s_{1234}) \\nonumber\\\\\n&&+\\left(\\frac{{\\langle 2  .\\rangle}3{[ 4 .]}1}{2{\\langle 1|.|P]}_{34}.1} - \\frac{\\spa1.2{\\langle 3  .\\rangle}4{[ 4 .]}1^2}{4{\\langle 1|.|P]}_{34}.1^2} \\right)\\log{\\left(\\frac{-s_{34}}{-s_{134}}\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\\n&&+\\left(\\frac{\\spa2.3\\spb4.1}{2\\spab2.P_{34}.2}-\\frac{\\spa2.3^2\\spb2.1\\spb4.3}{4\\spab2.P_{34}.2^2}\\right)\n\\log{\\left(\\frac{-s_{34}}{-s_{234}}\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\\n&&-\\frac{\\spa2.3^2\\spb2.1}{4\\spa3.4\\spab2.P_{34}.2}-\\frac{\\spa1.2\\spb4.1^2}{4\\spab1.P_{34}.1\\spb4.3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe finite part of the two-mass easy box is defined as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\operatorname{ {\\rm F}^{2me}_{4F}}}(s,t;P^2,Q^2)&=&-2\\bigg[\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{s}\\bigg)\n+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2}{t}\\bigg)+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{Q^2}{s}\\bigg)\n\\nonumber\\\\&&+\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{Q^2}{t}\\bigg)-\\mathrm{Li}_2\\bigg(1-\\frac{P^2Q^2}{st}\\bigg)\n+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln^2\\bigg(\\frac{s}{t}\\bigg)\\bigg]\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\subsection{$V_{II}$ pieces} \n\nNext we consider the $V_{II}$ diagrams, in which the vector boson also couples to the closed fermion loop.\n(cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:ZHtop}, left).  These contributions therefore only exist for $ZH$ production.\nThe results of ref.~\\cite{Brein:2011vx} show that the leading terms in the \n$m_t$ asymptotic expansion correspond to the $q\\overline{q}ZH$  effective vertex multiplying a two-loop massless\ntadpole diagram. The leading term in the expansion thus has the form of a tree-level amplitude \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n|\\mathcal{M}^{V_{II}}\\rangle_{ZH}=16\\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{4\\pi^2}G_F e m_W (v_L^t-v_R^t)\\sum_{i=L,R} \nv_i^{\\ell}\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{VII}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{VII}(1^+_{\\overline{q}},2^-_q,3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},p_H)\n=\\frac{\\spb1.4\\spa3.2}{s_{34}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe $(v_L^t-v_R^t)$ factor arises since only the axial part of the two-loop massive tadpole contributes to the\namplitude. \n\n\\subsection{$R_I$ pieces} \n\nFinally we present the results for the $R_I$ contribution (cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:WHtop}, left). These contributions are\nuniversal and occur for either $WH$ or $ZH$ production. They correspond to one-loop calculations and can be\nperformed  either including the top quark mass in full, or in the effective field theory. The general structure of\nthe result is as follows, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n|\\mathcal{M}^{R_{I}}\\rangle_{WH}= \\frac{g_s g_w^2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathcal{P}_W(s_{34}) \\mathcal{J}^{FT/EFT} \\sum_{h_5=\\pm 1} \n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{R_I}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^{h_5},p_H)\\mathcal{I}^{FT/EFT}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe helicity amplitude is universal,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\mathcal{A}^{(0)}_{R_I}(1^-_{q},2^+_{\\overline{q}},3^-_{\\ell},4^+_{\\overline{\\ell}},5_g^+,p_H)&=&\n\\frac{\\spab3.P_{24}.5{\\langle 1|.|P]}_{234}.5\\spb4.2}{s_{1234}s_{234}s_{34}}\n       \\nonumber\\\\&&  +\\frac{\\spa1.3\\spb5.2\n     ({\\langle 1  .\\rangle}2{[ 4 .]}1\\spb5.2-\\spa2.3\\spb4.3\\spb5.2\n     +s_{134}\\spb5.4)}{s_{1234}s_{134}s_{34}}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nbut the prefactor $\\mathcal{J}$ depends on whether one is in the full or the effective field theory, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{J}^{FT} &=& \\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{4\\pi} \\frac{m_t^2}{2m_W} g_w \\\\\n\\mathcal{J}^{EFT} &=& \\frac{{\\alpha_s}}{3\\pi v} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nFinally, the function $\\mathcal{I}$ is either equal to unity in the effective field theory or is a\ncombination of scalar loop integrals in the full theory,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{I}^{EFT}&=&1 \\\\\n\\mathcal{I}^{FT} &=& 8\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{4m_t^2}{s_{12345}-s_{1234}}\\right)I_3(s_{12345},s_{1234},m_t^2)\\\\&&  \n+\\frac{s_{1234}}{(s_{12345}-s_{1234})^2}\\left(I_2(s_{1234},m_t^2)-I_2(s_{12345},m_t^2)\\right)\n-\\frac{1}{s_{12345}-s_{1234}}\\bigg) \\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $I_3(s,t,m_t^2)$ and $I_2(s,m_t^2)$ represent the triangle with two massive external legs and the bubble\nintegral, respectively; in both cases the internal propagators have a common mass, $m_t$.\nIn the notation of the QCDLoop library~\\cite{Ellis:2007qk}, which we use to evaluate the integrals,\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nI_3(s,t,m_t^2) \\equiv I_3(s,t,0; m_t^2,m_t^2,m_t^2) \\quad\n\\mbox{and} \\quad\nI_2(s,m_t^2) \\equiv I_2(s; m_t^2,m_t^2) \\,.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"I_{3}(s,t,m_{t}^{2})\\equiv I_{3}(s,t,0;m_{t}^{2},m_{t}^{2},m_{t}^{2})\\quad%&#10;\\mbox{and}\\quad I_{2}(s,m_{t}^{2})\\equiv I_{2}(s;m_{t}^{2},m_{t}^{2})\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>;</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mtext>and</mtext></mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>;</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
