dihydrogenphosphate (KH$_2$PO$_4$, hereafter KDP) \nwas one of the first discovered ferroelectric materials \\cite{iona}, \nthe microscopic mechanism at play during its ferroelectric phase \ntransition has been one of the most difficult to understand. \nThe crystals of the KDP family belong to the class of hydrogen-bonded \nferroelectrics, in which protons play an important role: \ntheir PO$_4$ molecular units are linked by hydrogen bonds, \nand ferroelectricity appears to be connected to the behaviour \nof the protons in these bonds. \nThe generic theoretical framework describing the hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics was introduced by Slater \\cite{slater}: \nthe static and dynamic properties of these systems are described on the basis of the configuration energy\ndetermined by proton configurations (Fig. \\ref{fig.Hconfigs}). \nIn Slater's model, each proton occupies one of two possible crystallographic positions in its bond. \nIn the paraelectric phase, both positions are equivalent and randomly occupied, while in the ferroelectric phase one of the positions is favoured, according to the local ferroelectric polarisation. \nThe ferroelectric transition appears thus as a classical order-disorder phase transition \\cite{slater,takagi1,senko}.\nIntensive experimental and theoretical investigation has confirmed this model \\cite{strukov74}. \nThe proton ordering at the phase transition has been evidenced and correlated with atomic displacements along the $c$-axis at the origin of the electric polarisation \\cite{nelmes1985}.\nTo explain the large effect of deuteration on the transition, Blinc suggested that, instead of a static proton disorder, \nprotons are in fact delocalised and tunnel back and forth between both sites of a double-well potential \\cite{blinc}.\nSince then, the nature of the phase transition, either order-disorder or confinement-deconfinement, has been much debated \n(see, \\textit{e.g.}, reviews by Schmidt \\cite{schmidt}, Tokunaga \\& Matsubara \\cite{tokunaga} and Lines \\& Glass \\cite{lines}).\nGeometrical effects have been suggested as an alternative to tunnelling to explain the modification of the phase transition of deuteration \\cite{ichikawa1981,ichikawa1987}. \nNowadays there is growing evidence for a combination of both effects \\cite{nelmes1988,bussmannholder}. \nIndeed, recent \\textit{ab initio} calculations \\cite{koval2002,koval2005} confirm the interplay of geometrical and tunneling effects, \nand provide a more accurate view of the tunneling mechanism, which involves not only protons but larger clusters including heavy atoms.\nExperimentally, recent neutron Compton scattering experiments have shown strong evidence for the deconfinement of the protons in the paraelectric phase \\cite{reiter2002}.\nWhile the role of the protons during the phase transition is now well established, \nnot much attention has been given to their behaviour in the paraelectric phase.\nIn particular, a number of different proton configurations have been proposed \\cite{slater,takagi2} \nand are expected to coexist with different probabilities, but a quantitative experimental \nevaluation of their probabilities is still lacking.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\columnwidth]{figure_1a}\n

on a spectroscopic study of the forbidden reflections of KDP with resonant x rays. \nWe recently demonstrated that such forbidden reflections show spectacular \neffects across the phase transition \\cite{beutier14}.\nHere we go further by carefully modeling the spectra and their \ntemperature dependence in the paraelectric phase; \nwe determine the relative probabilities of various proton configurations \nand show that they change with temperature.\nRecently, a similar effect has been studied in rubidium dihydrogen phosphate (hereafter RDP), \nwhose structure is isomorphic to that of KDP \\cite{richter14}. Due to the limited number \nof data sets and the limited temperature range, only one particular \nproton configuration (the so-called Slater configuration - see below) \nwas evidenced. Here, by studying two different types of forbidden reflections \n(the $00l$ and $hhh$ reflections) at two different azimuths and over a large \ntemperature range, we are able to extract the contributions of all three main proton configurations.\nTo this purpose, we present a methodology to deal quantitatively \nwith the influence of defects in resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), \nthe scope of which goes well beyond the particular case of KDP.\n\n\n\\section{Forbidden reflections in the para- and ferroelectric phases\n\\label{theory}}\n\n\n\\subsection{General structure factor for the forbidden reflections}\n\nThe paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition of KDP occurs at\nthe Curie temperature $T_c=123$ K. The paraelectric and\nferroelectric phases have, respectively, body-centered tetragonal ($I\\bar 42d$,\n$Z=4$) and face-centered orthorhombic ($Fdd2$, $Z=8$) systems,\nand ferroelectricity appears along the $c$-axis. \nIn the paraelectric (tetragonal) phase of KDP, each proton \ntunnels back and forth between \ntwo sites of equal probabilities related by symmetry. The\ndisordered distribution of each proton between two oxygen atoms of\nthe hydrogen bond has been confirmed by neutron diffraction \\cite{nelmes1982}. \nThe description of the paraelectric phase by the $I\\bar 42d$ group\ncorresponds to the structure averaged over the proton distribution.\n\nThe usual settings used for the description of the ferro- and\nparaelectric phases differ by a rotation of 45$^\\circ$ around the\n$c$ axis accompanying a doubling of the unit cell. Below we shall\nuse the settings which correspond to the paraelectric (disordered) phase \n\\footnote{unlike in Ref. \\onlinecite{beutier14}}. \nIn these settings, Bragg reflections with Miller indices $hhl$ \nsuch that $2h+l=4n+2$ are forbidden in conventional \nx-ray diffraction in both phases, due to a glide-plane symmetry. \nHowever they appear with significant intensity when the energy \nof the incoming x rays is tuned close to an absorption edge, \ndue to the anisotropy of the tensor of scattering \\cite{dmitrienko83}: \nindeed we recently reported the observation of the $002$ and $222$ \nreflections at the potassium K edge \\cite{beutier14}. \nWe showed that the intensity and the energy spectra of these reflections undergo huge changes across the phase transition, \nbecause the electric dipole-dipole (E1E1) resonant scattering vanishes in the higher symmetry (tetragonal) phase.\n\nThe general structure factor $F$ of the Bragg reflections \nwith Miller indices $hhl$, $2h+l=4n+2$, is equal to\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n F =  2\\left( f^{(1)} - f^{(2)} \\right)\n\\label{F}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math

The $002$ and\n$222$ forbidden reflections were measured at the potassium K edge\n($\\sim$3.608 keV). The measurements were performed in vertical\nscattering geometry with the natural linear ($\\sigma$)\npolarisation of the incoming beam and without polarisation\nanalysis of the scattered beam. The azimuthal reference is the 100\naxis and the azimuth $\\psi$  is zero when the azimuthal reference is in the\nscattering plane. KDP is known to suffer from radiation damage,\nand so great care was taken to ensure the reproducibility of the\nresults presented here. Indeed, we observed radiation damage\nduring the preliminary measurements at beamline I16 when the incident beam was insufficiently attenuated.\n\nRocking curves were recorded at 3.6095 keV and showed a Lorentzian\nshape with a varying width as a function of the temperature\n\\cite{beutier14}. Energy spectra were recorded in the same\ntemperature loop and were corrected for the fluorescence\nbackground and for the varying ratio between integrated\nintensity and peak intensity of the rocking curves. The corrected\nspectra $I_{exp}(hkl,\\psi)$ are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig.TE}.\n\nAs reported in \\cite{beutier14}, a spectacular change of spectrum and intensity can be seen across\nthe phase transition ({$T_c\\approx123$ K}), due to the switching\non/off of the pure electric dipole (E1E1) component: the latter\nvanishes in the tetragonal phase for symmetry reasons\n\\cite{beutier14,mukhamedzhanov}. In this paper we focus on the\ntetragonal phase, whose energy spectra show interesting features\nin their temperature dependence. Looking at the 002 reflection, we\nsee that \n(1) the spectrum changes with azimuth, meaning that more\nthan one independent component contributes to the structure factor,\nin agreement with the symmetry analysis presented in Sec.\n\\ref{theory}; \n(2) the spectra at both azimuths change with temperature, revealing the contribution of more than one\nscattering process, with different temperature dependences\n(presumably one of them is independent of the temperature); \nand (3) the change of spectrum is stronger at $\\psi=-83^\\circ$ than at\n$\\psi=-48^\\circ$. The case of the 222 reflection is less\nspectacular but essentially shows the same features. We note that\nboth reflections have very different spectra, pointing at a very\ndifferent mix of the contributing amplitudes.\n\n\n\\section{Data analysis}\n\nAn analysis of the ferroelectric phase can be found in Appendix B. \nHere we deal only with the paraelectric phase.\n\nThe structure amplitude (\\ref{sf}) of forbidden reflections involves three independent complex tensor components:\nthey interfere in the intensity and it is thus impossible to extract them directly from the four measurements (two reflections at two azimuths).\nThe analysis of the experimental spectra is therefore based on modelling with the FDMNES code \\cite{bunau,fdmnes}.\nThe latter calculates resonant scattering amplitudes based on an input crystallographic configuration.\nOne should thus be able to evaluate several parameters of the crystallographic configuration, \nsuch as thermal motion and the relative probabilities of the various proton configurations, by trying to fit the experimental spectra.\n\nIn more details, we calculate the amplitudes $F_{\\sigma\\sigma}$ and $F_{\\sigma\\pi}$, \nwhich are the values of the structure factor (\\ref{sf})\nfor incident polarisation $\\sigma$ and scattered polarisation $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ respectively.\nThe calculations are performed with the multiple scattering method of FDMNES \\cite{joly}, \nusing the convolution parameters obtained from the fits of the absorption spectra (see Appendix A).\n\n\n\\subsection{Self-absorption correction}\n\nIn the kinematical theory of diffraction, \nthe integrated intensity $I$ measured in Bragg geometry from a

All three\ncomponents contribute to the structure factor of $hhh, h=4n+2$\nforbidden reflections.\n\n\n\\section{Experimental}\n\\label{exp}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_2a}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_2b}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_2c}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_2d}\n    \\caption{Temperature dependence of the spectra of the $002$ and $222$ forbidden reflections at two azimuths each. \n         Intensities were corrected for the fluorescent background, normalized by the incident beam intensity, and corrected for the varying ratio between integrated intensity and peak intensity of the rocking curve.\n         Colour bars show the temperature scale.\n         }\n    \\label{fig.TE}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nA single crystal of KDP was grown and cut with surface normal 001 at the Institute of Crystallography (Moscow).\nREXS was measured at beam line BM28 (XMaS) of the European Synchrotron Radiation\nFacility, with preliminary measurements and fluorescence\nmeasurements performed at beam line I16 of Diamond Light Source \\cite{i16}. \nThe sample was enclosed in a closed-cycle cryofurnace\nand the temperature varied between 15 and 320 K. The $002$ and\n$222$ forbidden reflections were measured at the potassium K edge\n($\\sim$3.608 keV). The measurements were performed in vertical\nscattering geometry with the natural linear ($\\sigma$)\npolarisation of the incoming beam and without polarisation\nanalysis of the scattered beam. The azimuthal reference is the 100\naxis and the azimuth $\\psi$  is zero when the azimuthal reference is in the\nscattering plane. KDP is known to suffer from radiation damage,\nand so great care was taken to ensure the reproducibility of the\nresults presented here. Indeed, we observed radiation damage\nduring the preliminary measurements at beamline I16 when the incident beam was insufficiently attenuated.\n\nRocking curves were recorded at 3.6095 keV and showed a Lorentzian\nshape with a varying width as a function of the temperature\n\\cite{beutier14}. Energy spectra were recorded in the same\ntemperature loop and were corrected for the fluorescence\nbackground and for the varying ratio between integrated\nintensity and peak intensity of the rocking curves. The corrected\nspectra $I_{exp}(hkl,\\psi)$ are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig.TE}.\n\nAs reported in \\cite{beutier14}, a spectacular change of spectrum and intensity can be seen across\nthe phase transition ({$T_c\\approx123$ K}), due to the switching\non/off of the pure electric dipole (E1E1) component: the latter\nvanishes in the tetragonal phase for symmetry reasons\n\\cite{beutier14,mukhamedzhanov}. In this paper we focus on the\ntetragonal phase, whose energy spectra show interesting features\nin their temperature dependence. Looking at the 002 reflection, we\nsee that \n(1) the spectrum changes with azimuth, meaning that more\nthan one independent component contributes to the structure factor,\nin agreement with the symmetry analysis presented in Sec.\n\\ref{theory}; \n(2) the spectra at both azimuths change with temperature, revealing the contribution of more than one\nscattering process, with different temperature dependences\n(presumably one of them is independent of the temperature); \nand (3) the change of spectrum is stronger at $\\psi=-83^\\circ$ than at\n$\\psi=-48^\\circ$. The case of the 222 reflection is less\nspectacular but essentially shows the same features. We note that\nboth reflections have very different spectra, pointing at a very\ndifferent mix of the contributing amplitudes.\n\n\n\\section{Data analysis}\n\nAn analysis of the ferroelectric phase can be found in Appendix B. \nHere we deal only with the paraelectric phase.\n\nThe structure amplitude (\\ref{sf}) of forbidden reflections involves three independent complex tensor components:\nthey interfere in the intensity and it is thus impossible to extract them directly from the four measurements (two reflections at two azimuths).\nThe analysis of the experimental spectra is therefore based on modelling with the FDMNES code \\cite{bunau,fdmnes}.\nThe latter calculates resonant scattering amplitudes based on an input crystallographic configuration.\nOne should thus be able to evaluate several parameters of the crystallographic configuration, \nsuch as thermal motion and the relative probabilities of the various proton configurations, by trying to fit the experimental spectra.\n\nIn more details, we calculate the amplitudes $F_{\\sigma\\sigma}$ and $F_{\\sigma\\pi}$, \nwhich are the values of the structure factor (\\ref{sf})\nfor incident polarisation $\\sigma$ and scattered polarisation $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ respectively.\nThe calculations are performed with the multiple scattering method of FDMNES \\cite{joly}, \nusing the convolution parameters obtained from the fits of the absorption spectra (see Appendix A).\n\n\n\\subsection{Self-absorption correction}\n\nIn the kinematical theory of diffraction, \nthe integrated intensity $I$ measured in Bragg geometry from a thick sample, \nwith incident polarisation $\\sigma$ and no polarisation analysis of the scattered beam, \nis proportional to\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  I = \\left[ \\frac{\\mid F_{\\sigma\\sigma}\\mid^2}\n  {\\mu_\\sigma+g\\mu^\\prime_\\sigma} + \\frac{\\mid F_{\\sigma\\pi}\\mid^2}\n  {\\mu_\\sigma+g\\mu^\\prime_\\pi} \\right]e^{-2M} \\label{int}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"I=\\left[\\frac{\\mid F_{\\sigma\\sigma}\\mid^{2}}{\\mu_{\\sigma}+g\\mu^{\\prime}_{%&#10;\\sigma}}+\\frac{\\mid F_{\\sigma\\pi}\\mid^{2}}{\\mu_{\\sigma}+g\\mu^{\\prime}_{\\pi}}%&#10;\\right]e^{-2M}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo>\u2223</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2223</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>\u03c3</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo>\u2223</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2223</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>\u03c3</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00776.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe anisotropic character of the material is reflected by the\nchoice of $\\tilde\\mu$, which is chosen differently for different\nreflections and different azimuths.

accounts for a small dependence of the E1E2 term on atomic positions.\n\n\n\\subsection{Model of TMI scattering}\n\nThe TMI contribution to the resonant structure factor was calculated \nwith the same method as that developed for Ge and the wurtzites \\cite{ovchinnikova05,ovchinnikova10}, \nwhich has been validated by \\textit{ab initio} calculations \\cite{oreshko12}.\nWe simulated a $2\\times 2\\times 2$ supercell\nin which all atoms were randomly displaced from their average positions. \nThe displacement amplitudes were chosen according to the data given in Ref. \n\\onlinecite{nelmes1982} for {125 K}. \nThis model neglects the correlations between the displacements of the various atoms.\nTherefore it yields similar results to a model taking into account the displacements \nof the resonant atoms alone.\nIn this approximation, the TMI contribution to the atomic factor \ndepends linearly on the displacements of the resonant atom, \nwhich are supposed to be isotropic. \nMoreover the calculations of the TMI spectrum show that \nits lineshape does not change with temperature, \nso that the temperature plays only as a global scalar on the spectrum.\nThis point has been demonstrated with \\textit{ab initio} calculations \nin the case of ZnO and GaN \\cite{oreshko12}.\nWe can thus consider the TMI contribution as the product of a temperature-independent \nspectrum $F_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}^{TMI}(E)$ \nand a temperature-dependent scalar coefficient $a^{TMI}(T)$.\n\n\n\\subsection{Model for the contribution of the proton configurations}\n\nA method to calculate the PC contributions has been reported \\cite{richter14}: \nit consists of calculating the various tensor components $f_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}^{\\mathcal C}$ \nfor each configuration according to Eq. (\\ref{fijkC}) after relaxing \nthe structure in the chosen configuration.\nAfter the calculation of the $f_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}^{\\mathcal C}$,\nphenomenological expressions describing the azimuthal dependence of the reflections\nare derived and used to fit the experimental data.\nThis approach gives satisfactory fits to the experimental data. \n\nIn order to improve the spectra description we present here another \nmethod to simulate the energy spectra, \nwhich we believe is more reliable because all\ncalculations are made in the same FDMNES calculation\nand there is no necessity to use phenomenological expressions.\nInstead of modelling the Cartesian components $f^\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$, \nwe directly calculate the structure amplitudes $F_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}$ \nof the forbidden reflections as a sum of several contributions. \nSimilarly to the method applied in Ref. \\onlinecite{ovchinnikova10} \nwe suppose that each contribution to the scattering amplitude \nmay be considered as a temperature-independent spectrum \n$F^X_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}(E)$ ($X\\in\\{\\mathcal{P,S,T}\\}$) \nmultiplied by a temperature-dependent coefficient $a^{X}(T)$. \nTo calculate the PC contributions, \nwe have constructed supercells, where all protons \noccupy the same configuration chosen among the $\\mathcal P$, $\\mathcal S$, and $\\mathcal T$ configurations. \nHere we consider the proton configurations as independent static defects. \nThe {\\it ab initio} code VASP \\cite{kresse96,kresse99} \nwas used to compute the relaxation of the structure\nfor the chosen proton configuration and obtain new atomic coordinates. \nThe resulting coordinates are slightly different inside each\npair of configurations. \nOf particular interest is the displacement $\\bm u(\\mathcal C)$ of the resonant atom.\nThese calculations were made for each temperature, \ntaking into account the change of lattice parameters\nand of the spacing $\\delta$ between the two proton sites of the H-bond, \nin correspondence with the data given in Ref. \\onlinecite{nelmes1982}. \nThe variation of $\\bm u(\\mathcal C)$ obtained in the {125-300 K} range does not exceed 5$\\%$ \nfor the three types of proton configurations considered here \nand provides similarly weak variations of $\\Delta f_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathcal C)$.\nThe variation is essentially a global scaler of the spectrum with a linear dependence in temperature. \nIt supports our model, in which each contribution $F^X_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}(E)$ \nis assumed to be independent of the temperature, \nprovided the global dependence is included in the coefficient $a^X(T)$.\nThen the spectra $F^X_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}(E)$ \ncorresponding to each configuration are calculated with FDMNES, using the relaxed structures.\nThe coefficients $a^{X}(T)$ are obtained by fitting \nthe experimental data at each recorded temperature.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3a}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3b}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3c}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3d}\n      \\caption{Contributions of the various scattering processes to the intensity of the forbidden reflections $002$ and $222$, for the measured azimuthal angles, at 300 K.\n      See text for details.}\n    \\label{contributions}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral contributions and fits}\n\nFor each temperature, we have four experimental energy spectra: \ntwo reflections at two different azimuths each.\nThe four scalar parameters of the model can thus be reliably \ndetermined by fitting the experimental spectra.\nThe task is simplified because all contributions possess different energy\ndependences: it is more or less obvious which contribution is\nresponsible for different parts of the energy spectra. \nThis is shown in Fig. \\ref{contributions}, which presents the contributions\n$I^{X}(E)=\\left(|F^X_{\\sigma\\pi}(E)|^2+|F^X_{\\sigma\\sigma}(E)|^2\\right)/\\tilde\\mu(E)$\nfor the $002$ and $222$ reflections each for two azimuthal angles at 300 K. \nWe see that the dipole-quadrupole, TMI, and Takagi configurations \ncontribute in the structure factor mainly in the lower part of the energy spectra, \nwhile the higher-energy side is mainly provided by the polar and Slater configurations. \nMoreover, the dipole-quadrupole and TMI contributions predominate in the $002$ reflection, \nwhile the PC contributions become more important in the $222$ reflection.\n\nNevertheless, the intensity spectra of the forbidden reflections \nare not simple sums of these partial intensity spectra, \nbut are determined by the interference between the complex amplitudes.\nBy fitting the experimental spectra against Eqs. (\\ref{intensity}) and (\\ref{SF}), we obtained the coefficients $a^X$. \n\nIn Ref. \\onlinecite{richter14}, only the Slater configurations were evidenced:\nthe polar configurations were found to contribute to the experimental spectra \nand the Takagi configurations were neglected due to their higher energy. \nIn the case of KDP, it turns out that all three types of configurations are needed \nto explain the experimental spectra, which are much more complex than those of RDP. \nHowever, the line shape of the Takagi configurations cannot easily be disentangled from that of the TMI and polar configurations.\nWhile they provide a sensible improvement of the fits, their coefficient $a^\\mathcal{T}$ lacks reliability.\n\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_5a}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_5b}\n         \\caption{Left: Temperature dependence of the various contributions to forbidden reflections. \n         Right: Arrhenius plots of the polar and Slater contributions.\n         (Open circles: experimental data obtained from the spectra fitting; solid line: approximating functions (see text for details).}\n    \\label{fitting}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4a}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4b}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4c}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4d}\n      \\caption{Energy spectra of the $002$ and $222$ reflections at the two measured azimuths,\n      at various temperatures.

(\\ref{fijkC}) after relaxing \nthe structure in the chosen configuration.\nAfter the calculation of the $f_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}^{\\mathcal C}$,\nphenomenological expressions describing the azimuthal dependence of the reflections\nare derived and used to fit the experimental data.\nThis approach gives satisfactory fits to the experimental data. \n\nIn order to improve the spectra description we present here another \nmethod to simulate the energy spectra, \nwhich we believe is more reliable because all\ncalculations are made in the same FDMNES calculation\nand there is no necessity to use phenomenological expressions.\nInstead of modelling the Cartesian components $f^\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$, \nwe directly calculate the structure amplitudes $F_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}$ \nof the forbidden reflections as a sum of several contributions. \nSimilarly to the method applied in Ref. \\onlinecite{ovchinnikova10} \nwe suppose that each contribution to the scattering amplitude \nmay be considered as a temperature-independent spectrum \n$F^X_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}(E)$ ($X\\in\\{\\mathcal{P,S,T}\\}$) \nmultiplied by a temperature-dependent coefficient $a^{X}(T)$. \nTo calculate the PC contributions, \nwe have constructed supercells, where all protons \noccupy the same configuration chosen among the $\\mathcal P$, $\\mathcal S$, and $\\mathcal T$ configurations. \nHere we consider the proton configurations as independent static defects. \nThe {\\it ab initio} code VASP \\cite{kresse96,kresse99} \nwas used to compute the relaxation of the structure\nfor the chosen proton configuration and obtain new atomic coordinates. \nThe resulting coordinates are slightly different inside each\npair of configurations. \nOf particular interest is the displacement $\\bm u(\\mathcal C)$ of the resonant atom.\nThese calculations were made for each temperature, \ntaking into account the change of lattice parameters\nand of the spacing $\\delta$ between the two proton sites of the H-bond, \nin correspondence with the data given in Ref. \\onlinecite{nelmes1982}. \nThe variation of $\\bm u(\\mathcal C)$ obtained in the {125-300 K} range does not exceed 5$\\%$ \nfor the three types of proton configurations considered here \nand provides similarly weak variations of $\\Delta f_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathcal C)$.\nThe variation is essentially a global scaler of the spectrum with a linear dependence in temperature. \nIt supports our model, in which each contribution $F^X_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}(E)$ \nis assumed to be independent of the temperature, \nprovided the global dependence is included in the coefficient $a^X(T)$.\nThen the spectra $F^X_{\\epsilon\\epsilon^\\prime}(E)$ \ncorresponding to each configuration are calculated with FDMNES, using the relaxed structures.\nThe coefficients $a^{X}(T)$ are obtained by fitting \nthe experimental data at each recorded temperature.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3a}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3b}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3c}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_3d}\n      \\caption{Contributions of the various scattering processes to the intensity of the forbidden reflections $002$ and $222$, for the measured azimuthal angles, at 300 K.\n      See text for details.}\n    \\label{contributions}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral contributions and fits}\n\nFor each temperature, we have four experimental energy spectra: \ntwo reflections at two different azimuths each.\nThe four scalar parameters of the model can thus be reliably \ndetermined by fitting the experimental spectra.\nThe task is simplified because all contributions possess different energy\ndependences: it is more or less obvious which contribution is\nresponsible for different parts of the energy spectra. \nThis is shown in Fig. \\ref{contributions}, which presents the contributions\n$I^{X}(E)=\\left(|F^X_{\\sigma\\pi}(E)|^2+|F^X_{\\sigma\\sigma}(E)|^2\\right)/\\tilde\\mu(E)$\nfor the $002$ and $222$ reflections each for two azimuthal angles at 300 K. \nWe see that the dipole-quadrupole, TMI, and Takagi configurations \ncontribute in the structure factor mainly in the lower part of the energy spectra, \nwhile the higher-energy side is mainly provided by the polar and Slater configurations. \nMoreover, the dipole-quadrupole and TMI contributions predominate in the $002$ reflection, \nwhile the PC contributions become more important in the $222$ reflection.\n\nNevertheless, the intensity spectra of the forbidden reflections \nare not simple sums of these partial intensity spectra, \nbut are determined by the interference between the complex amplitudes.\nBy fitting the experimental spectra against Eqs. (\\ref{intensity}) and (\\ref{SF}), we obtained the coefficients $a^X$. \n\nIn Ref. \\onlinecite{richter14}, only the Slater configurations were evidenced:\nthe polar configurations were found to contribute to the experimental spectra \nand the Takagi configurations were neglected due to their higher energy. \nIn the case of KDP, it turns out that all three types of configurations are needed \nto explain the experimental spectra, which are much more complex than those of RDP. \nHowever, the line shape of the Takagi configurations cannot easily be disentangled from that of the TMI and polar configurations.\nWhile they provide a sensible improvement of the fits, their coefficient $a^\\mathcal{T}$ lacks reliability.\n\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_5a}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_5b}\n         \\caption{Left: Temperature dependence of the various contributions to forbidden reflections. \n         Right: Arrhenius plots of the polar and Slater contributions.\n         (Open circles: experimental data obtained from the spectra fitting; solid line: approximating functions (see text for details).}\n    \\label{fitting}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4a}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4b}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4c}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figure_4d}\n      \\caption{Energy spectra of the $002$ and $222$ reflections at the two measured azimuths,\n      at various temperatures.

correlations are also ignored in the simulation of the thermal effects.\nSecond, the spectroscopic calculations of forbidden reflections are never very accurate, even in simple cases, \nbecause they involve complicated quantum calculations, such as the convolution with the width of the excited state, which is unknown. \nFor these two reasons, it is not impossible that the contribution of the polar configurations is not well evaluated. \nNevertheless, we found, maybe fortuitously, a value of the activation energy of Slater configurations (7.3 meV) that is in fair agreement with the values reported in the literature.\nThe activation energy of Slater configurations with respect to the polar configurations has been evaluated to 5.2 meV by Fairall and Reese \\cite{fairall}, \nbased on a phenomenological model and experimental polarisation curves.\nRecent \\textit{ab initio} calculations yielded values of 16.9 meV for uncorrelated Slater defects and 5.0 meV for Slater defects correlated in chains \\cite{lasave2005}.\nThe better agreement of the latter with the value of Fairall and Reese suggests the occurrence of correlated Slater clusters. \nOur value (7.3 meV) is also in better agreement with the correlated model, although significantly different.\nRakvin and Dalal \\cite{rakvin} and Hukuda \\cite{hukuda} independently found a much higher activation energy (190 meV) from electronic spin resonance measurements, \nbut their measurements cannot attribute it to a particular configuration.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusion}\n\nThe results presented above show very clearly that forbidden reflections are sensitive to proton configurations in hydrogen bonds.\nWe have presented above a method to analyse quantitatively their spectra and extract the relative probabilities of the configurations.\nWe find that the concentration of the polar and Slater configurations in KDP has a strong temperature dependence which follows the Arrhenius law.\nThe resulting activation energies for polar and Slater configurations are in a reasonable order of magnitude but are in reversed order compared to the usually accepted model. \nThis suggests that the quantitative analysis of the spectra requires further development.\n\nBy comparison with the results obtained from the $006$ and $550$\nforbidden reflections of RDP \\cite{richter14}, \nwhose crystal symmetry is isomorphic to KDP, \nthe temperature effects are stronger in KDP. \nFirst, the phase transition from the para- to ferroelectric\nphase provides a much stronger intensity jump at the $002$ reflection \nof KDP \\cite{beutier14} than at the $006$ reflection of RDP.\nSecond, the energy spectra of the forbidden reflections \nare more complicated in KDP than in RDP and their variation with\ntemperature is also stronger. \nThis spectroscopic difference is the result of a structural difference: \nwhile both materials have the same symmetry, \nRb atoms are heavier than potassium atoms and the lattice\nis possibly more rigid. \n\nMoreover, we evidenced in KDP the contributions of the\npolar proton configurations, while in RDP only\nthe presence of the Slater configurations had been observed (in the $550$ reflection). \nThis could be achieved by collecting a larger set of experimental data in KDP, \n\\textit{i.e.}, two reflections at two azimuths each, \nusing the same simple theoretical framework.\nMoreover, measuring the spectra of the forbidden reflections \nat various azimuthal angles over a large temperature range\ngives additional information, which is very important for fitting the spectra. \nNevertheless, the method has a limited accuracy, \nwhich is illustrated by the quality of the fits in Fig. \\ref{fits}. \nA number of simplifying assumptions contribute to this discrepancy: \n(a) In the calculation of the TMI term, \nwe neglect the correlation of atomic displacements, \nwhich is equivalent to considering that only the resonant atoms vibrate; \n(b) proton distributions in a double-well potential\nare considered as static configurations of defects \nand the structure amplitude is considered to be a sum of coherent contributions \nfrom the supercells with different kinds of defects; \nand (c) the various contributions to the resonant amplitude were calculated \nusing the multiple scattering approach (as opposed to the finite-difference method) \nwith a limited number of atoms involved in the multiple scattering model.\nNevertheless, this simple model provides a description of the main features \nof the forbidden reflections, their energy spectra and temperature dependence. \n\nAs such, this study raises questions about the physics of hydrogen-bonded\nmaterials, and provides a method to investigate them.\nWe should point out that while the potassium K edge provides a convenient resonance edge to apply the technique, \nthe phosphorus K edge could be even more sensitive. \nIndeed, the potassium atoms are not directly related to the hydrogen bonds, \nwhile the phosphorus atoms are located at the centre of the hydrogen-bonded oxygen tetrahedra. \nThe phosphorus K edge could possibly provide more accurate results and more detailed information about the proton configuration.\nREXS at this edge would nevertheless imply experimental complications, due to the low energy (2.1455 keV).\n\nFinally, we point out that the mechanism contributing to forbidden resonant reflections presented here, \n\\textit{i.e.}, the proton disorder, is a realisation of the point-defect-induced scattering predicted in Ref. \n\\onlinecite{dmitrienko2000}, \nwhich had not been evidenced experimentally prior to the studies of RDP and KDP. \nWhile it had been predicted as an effect of static disorder, here the protons are not static, \nbut they are seen as such during the resonant x-ray scattering process.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support of the XMaS staff\nfor the measurements

correlations are also ignored in the simulation of the thermal effects.\nSecond, the spectroscopic calculations of forbidden reflections are never very accurate, even in simple cases, \nbecause they involve complicated quantum calculations, such as the convolution with the width of the excited state, which is unknown. \nFor these two reasons, it is not impossible that the contribution of the polar configurations is not well evaluated. \nNevertheless, we found, maybe fortuitously, a value of the activation energy of Slater configurations (7.3 meV) that is in fair agreement with the values reported in the literature.\nThe activation energy of Slater configurations with respect to the polar configurations has been evaluated to 5.2 meV by Fairall and Reese \\cite{fairall}, \nbased on a phenomenological model and experimental polarisation curves.\nRecent \\textit{ab initio} calculations yielded values of 16.9 meV for uncorrelated Slater defects and 5.0 meV for Slater defects correlated in chains \\cite{lasave2005}.\nThe better agreement of the latter with the value of Fairall and Reese suggests the occurrence of correlated Slater clusters. \nOur value (7.3 meV) is also in better agreement with the correlated model, although significantly different.\nRakvin and Dalal \\cite{rakvin} and Hukuda \\cite{hukuda} independently found a much higher activation energy (190 meV) from electronic spin resonance measurements, \nbut their measurements cannot attribute it to a particular configuration.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusion}\n\nThe results presented above show very clearly that forbidden reflections are sensitive to proton configurations in hydrogen bonds.\nWe have presented above a method to analyse quantitatively their spectra and extract the relative probabilities of the configurations.\nWe find that the concentration of the polar and Slater configurations in KDP has a strong temperature dependence which follows the Arrhenius law.\nThe resulting activation energies for polar and Slater configurations are in a reasonable order of magnitude but are in reversed order compared to the usually accepted model. \nThis suggests that the quantitative analysis of the spectra requires further development.\n\nBy comparison with the results obtained from the $006$ and $550$\nforbidden reflections of RDP \\cite{richter14}, \nwhose crystal symmetry is isomorphic to KDP, \nthe temperature effects are stronger in KDP. \nFirst, the phase transition from the para- to ferroelectric\nphase provides a much stronger intensity jump at the $002$ reflection \nof KDP \\cite{beutier14} than at the $006$ reflection of RDP.\nSecond, the energy spectra of the forbidden reflections \nare more complicated in KDP than in RDP and their variation with\ntemperature is also stronger. \nThis spectroscopic difference is the result of a structural difference: \nwhile both materials have the same symmetry, \nRb atoms are heavier than potassium atoms and the lattice\nis possibly more rigid. \n\nMoreover, we evidenced in KDP the contributions of the\npolar proton configurations, while in RDP only\nthe presence of the Slater configurations had been observed (in the $550$ reflection). \nThis could be achieved by collecting a larger set of experimental data in KDP, \n\\textit{i.e.}, two reflections at two azimuths each, \nusing the same simple theoretical framework.\nMoreover, measuring the spectra of the forbidden reflections \nat various azimuthal angles over a large temperature range\ngives additional information, which is very important for fitting the spectra. \nNevertheless, the method has a limited accuracy, \nwhich is illustrated by the quality of the fits in Fig. \\ref{fits}. \nA number of simplifying assumptions contribute to this discrepancy: \n(a) In the calculation of the TMI term, \nwe neglect the correlation of atomic displacements, \nwhich is equivalent to considering that only the resonant atoms vibrate; \n(b) proton distributions in a double-well potential\nare considered as static configurations of defects \nand the structure amplitude is considered to be a sum of coherent contributions \nfrom the supercells with different kinds of defects; \nand (c) the various contributions to the resonant amplitude were calculated \nusing the multiple scattering approach (as opposed to the finite-difference method) \nwith a limited number of atoms involved in the multiple scattering model.\nNevertheless, this simple model provides a description of the main features \nof the forbidden reflections, their energy spectra and temperature dependence. \n\nAs such, this study raises questions about the physics of hydrogen-bonded\nmaterials, and provides a method to investigate them.\nWe should point out that while the potassium K edge provides a convenient resonance edge to apply the technique, \nthe phosphorus K edge could be even more sensitive. \nIndeed, the potassium atoms are not directly related to the hydrogen bonds, \nwhile the phosphorus atoms are located at the centre of the hydrogen-bonded oxygen tetrahedra. \nThe phosphorus K edge could possibly provide more accurate results and more detailed information about the proton configuration.\nREXS at this edge would nevertheless imply experimental complications, due to the low energy (2.1455 keV).\n\nFinally, we point out that the mechanism contributing to forbidden resonant reflections presented here, \n\\textit{i.e.}, the proton disorder, is a realisation of the point-defect-induced scattering predicted in Ref. \n\\onlinecite{dmitrienko2000}, \nwhich had not been evidenced experimentally prior to the studies of RDP and KDP. \nWhile it had been predicted as an effect of static disorder, here the protons are not static, \nbut they are seen as such during the resonant x-ray scattering process.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support of the XMaS staff\nfor the measurements
