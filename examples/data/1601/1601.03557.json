These influences are of special interest for realization of highly stable and accurate optical atomic clocks \\cite{7}-\\cite{15}, particularly neutral-atom-based optical frequency standards \\cite{15a}-\\cite{15g}.\n\nThere are a great number of works where the environmental influence on the atomic decay constant is studied both theoretically and experimentally \\cite{44a}-\\cite{41}. In the vast majority of these researchs, the case of a transparent and continuous surrounding medium is considered.  For theoretical description of such systems, both macroscopic and microscopic approaches are used. Depending on the different assumptions about the local environment of the embedded atom several models have been proposed and studied.  Among the most important, we note such approaches as a virtual cavity, a real cavity and so-called \"fully microscopic\" models.\n\nThe main goal of the present work is to study theoretically the case of disordered atomic ensembles with averaged interatomic distances greater than or comparable with the wavelength of the atomic transition as it is held in the optical atomic clock based on cold atoms \\cite{15a}-\\cite{15g}.  In such a case discrete structure of atomic clouds should be taken into account. Besides that the atomic radiation is quasi-resonant, and a model assuming quasi-transparent non-absorbing media is not valid.\n\nIn this work we make numerical Monte-Carlo simulations based on a quantum microscopic approach \\cite{44}. Numerical simulation allows us to analyze the process of single atom excitation decay, taking into account resonant multiple incoherent scattering of the light inside atomic cloud, without introduction of any adjustable parameters, as opposed to approaches used earlier for similar problems in  \\cite{38}-\\cite{41}. In addition, we do not use a continuous media approximation. It allows us to take into account correctly the discrete structure of atomic clouds and consequently the interatomic correlations which play, in our case, an important role.\n\nOne further unique feature of the present work is that we calculate not only the decay constant, but also dynamics of decay and the spectrum of the atomic transition, particularly the shifts of atomic lines caused by the dipole-dipole interaction. The question of density dependent spectral line shifts for cold atomic gases recently gave rise to a wide discussion, \\cite{45a}-\\cite{45f} and this question is especially important for optical frequency standards \\cite{15d}, \\cite{45r}.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we first lay out our basic assumptions and approach. This is followed by a presentation of our main results, and a discussion of them.\n\n\n\\section{Basic assumptions and approach}\n\nThe calculation of spontaneous decay dynamics in this paper will be made on the basis of a microscopic quantum approach developed in \\cite{44}. A similar approach was previously used for analogous problems in \\cite{27}, \\cite{28}. The authors of these papers searched for analytical solutions, in order to have an opportunity to analyze the validity of real and virtual cavity approximations.  They succeeded in finding an approximate expression for the decay constant up to the second order of the parameter $n\\alpha$, where $n$ is the atomic density and $\\alpha$ is the polarizability of a free atom. Besides that, final expressions in these papers were obtained for transparent and continuous medium.\n\nIn the present work we search for numerical solutions to this problem. It allows us to obtain results in all order of $n\\alpha$ and for arbitrary parameters of the excited atom.  The approach used is depicted in detail in \\cite{44} and we will not discuss it here.  We will mention only the main approximations used hereafter and will show the principal analytical expressions utilized for numerical calculations.\n\nNote also, that a similar microscopic approach combined with numerical calculation has been used in \\cite{PC10} for determination of averaged decay rate and for discussion the influence of local density of collective states on spontaneous decay of impurity atoms. However the authors did not analyze the explicit time dependence of atomic population and did not consider the spectrum of the atomic transition.\n\nWe consider an ensemble consisting of N atoms. All atoms have a ground state with $J = 0$ and an excited level with $J = 1$.  In the present paper we analyze two different cases. In the first, all atoms including the initially exited one are identical. The physical properties of clouds considered in this part of the paper correspond to the situation realized in atomic clocks \\cite{15a}-\\cite{15g}. Namely, interatomic separations are relatively big and the discrete structure of the clouds is important. The identity of the atoms means that radiation emitted by one of them is quasi resonant for the other. The main goal of this part of the paper is to study the single atom decay under such conditions.\nBy now single atom spectral response has not been studied in experiment. In typical experiments external radiation interacts with whole (or essential part of) atomic clouds. However in our opinion such a problem statement is interesting from a theoretical point of view. Beside that it is not completely abstract. Local excitation of atoms inside optically depth and dense clouds can be performed by means of method suggested earlier by M. D. Havey \\cite{PC}.\n\nFor such excitation one has to illuminate the cloud with two narrow and off resonant orthogonally propagated light beams. Each beam does not cause single photon excitation; but their simultaneous interaction with atoms in the crossing region can cause two-photon excitation from the ground $S$ to excited $D$ state if conditions of two-photon resonance are satisfied.  The subsequent spontaneous transition from $D$ to $P$ state leads to population of the studied $P$ state. Thereby described method allows obtaining small cluster of excited atoms in the middle of the cloud. For simplicity thereafter in the paper we will consider the case of only one atom excited. Note that possibilities of two-photon excitation $5s\\; S-2(1/2)\\rightarrow 5p\\; P-2(j)\\rightarrow 5d\\; D-2(j)'$ of rubidium atoms have been already studied in experiment \\cite{JPB06}.\n\nThe second case we will consider in the paper corresponds to spontaneous decay of an impurity atom embedded in homogeneous ensemble. In this case the transition frequency of the embedded atom $\\omega_{emb}$  and the natural linewidth of its excited state $\\gamma_{emb}$  differ from the corresponding values  $\\omega_{0}$ and $\\gamma_{0}$   of surrounding atoms.\n\n\nIn our calculation we will assume that all atoms are motionless. To take into account residual atomic motion and the random spatial inhomogeneity of the atomic ensemble, we will consider the statistical ensemble of clouds with a random distribution of atoms. The results presented below are obtained by averaging over this ensemble using the Monte Carlo method.\n\n\nThe microscopic approach enables us to consider the clouds of arbitrary form with an arbitrary nonuniform spatial distribution of atoms.  The initially excited atom can also be located at an arbitrary position.  Further, we will assume that atoms surrounding the emitting atom are randomly distributed in a cubic volume. The random distribution is uniform.  The initially excited atom itselfis in the center of the cube.  For the chosen geometry the system is isotopic on average, so we can consider the spontaneous decay of any Zeeman sublevel.  For determinacy we will assume that at initial time $t=0$ only one substate $m=-1$ of the central atom is populated. All the other atoms of the ensemble are in their ground state having $J=0,\\;m=0$.\n\nAll approximations described above allow us to avail ourselves of the results of the general theory developed in \\cite{44}. This theory was then mainly used for description of the interaction between light and dense atomic clouds in steady-state conditions \\cite{45},  \\cite{46}-\\cite{48}. Here we analyze the dynamics of the dense atomic ensemble.\n\nAccording to \\cite{44}, the time dependent amplitudes of the collective atomic states with one excited atom $b_{e_a^m}(t)$ can be found as follows\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nb_{e_a^m}(t)= \\int\\limits_{-\\infty }^{\\infty }\\frac{d\\omega\n}{2\\pi}exp(-i\\omega t)\\sum\\limits_{e_b^{m'}}\nR_{e_a^m e_b^{m'}}(\\omega)b^0_{e_b^{m'}}. \\label{2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"b_{e_{a}^{m}}(t)=\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}exp(-i%&#10;\\omega t)\\sum\\limits_{e_{b}^{m^{\\prime}}}R_{e_{a}^{m}e_{b}^{m^{\\prime}}}(%&#10;\\omega)b^{0}_{e_{b}^{m^{\\prime}}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>b</mi><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi></msubsup></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></munderover><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mi>b</mi><msup><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msubsup></munder><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mrow><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mi>b</mi><msup><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msubsup></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>b</mi><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mi>b</mi><msup><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msubsup><mn>0</mn></msubsup></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03557.tex", "nexttext": "\nHere $\\omega _{a}$ is equal to $\\omega _{emb}$ for the embedded atom and $\\omega _{0}$ for surrounding atoms.\n\nIf $a\\neq b$, the matrix $\\Sigma_{e_a^m e_b^{m'}}$ describes the excitation exchange between atoms $a$ and $b$ inside the cloud.

The calculations were made for an atomic density $n=0.05$ and for three different $N$ -- $N=300$; $N=1000$ and $N=2000$.

Initial state with only one excited atom can be expanded as a series over set of nonorthogonal eigenvectors of Green matrix for each random spatial configuration of the system. Among different collective quantum states in the considered ensemble there are both super- and sub-radiant ones. The former influences the spontaneous decay dynamics predominantly in the early stages; an atom inside the ensemble decays faster than a free atom. Even in the case of relatively small densities like $n=0.05$ the increasing in decay rate is important.  With time the role of sub-radiant states increases, resulting in a decrease in decay rate. For $t>1/\\gamma_{emb}$ this rate becomes less than that for free atoms (see Fig. 1b).\n\nThe specific type of decay dynamics for given density depends on the size of the atomic ensemble, i.e. on the number of atoms N in it. It is typical situation when sub and super radiant states manifest themselves in collective decay (for more detail see \\cite{AGK08}-\\cite{BPK12}). We have analyzed how the function $P_0(t)$ changes with $N$ and found that for small clouds when mean free path of photon less or comparable with linear size of atomic ensemble these changes are very essential. As $N$ and linear size increase the changes in $P_0(t)$  become more and more weak. This dependence has evident tendency to saturation.  Our calculation shows that for studied geometry for $n=0.05$ the curve $P_0(t)$ does not practically changes as $N$ becomes more than 300. So results obtained for $N>300$ can be used for description of single atom spontaneous decay inside any macroscopic ensemble with reasonable accuracy.\n\nIt is illustrated by the fig. 1a where we show time dependence of $P_0(t)$ for three different $N$. For times less or comparable with $3/\\gamma$ all three curves coincide with accuracy of calculations. Such behavior connects with specific initial condition considered in this paper (contrary to the cases studied in \\cite{AGK08}-\\cite{ BPK12}). Modification of decay rate of initially excited central atom is caused by radiation of this atom which is scattered back by atoms of environment. Results displayed in the fig.1a show that atoms of the cloud located far from central atom influence on decay faintly at this time interval. Slight discrepancy at bigger times when population $P_0(t)$ is already small, connects with the fact that lifetimes of the most long-lived collective states are very sensitive to specific spatial configuration of the cloud and for accurate averaging of corresponding dates volume of calculation  has to be increased immensely.\n\n\nIncreasing the density of surrounding atoms causes enhancement of collective effects and consequently more considerable modification of spontaneous decay.  This effect is illustrated by Fig. 2 which shows the dynamics of single atom excitation decay inside an ensemble with the atomic density $n=1$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n{$\\scalebox{0.4}{\\includegraphics*{fig2a.EPS}}$ }{$\\scalebox{0.4}{\n\\includegraphics*{fig2b.EPS}}$ }\n\\caption{(Color online) Spontaneous decay dynamics (a); time dependence of the effective spontaneous decay rate (b); $n=1$, $\\gamma_{emb}=\\gamma_{0}$, $\\Delta=0$, $N=2000$}\n\\end{center}\n\\par\n\\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt short times the decay constant is several times greater than for free atoms.  On the contrary, for $t>1/\\gamma_{emb}$ the decay process shown in Fig. 2 goes noticeably slower than in case of $n=0.05$.\n\nAs density increases the size of mesoscopic cloud for which we can neglect dependence $P_0(t)$ on $N$ is also increase. For $n=1$ we observed saturation for $N\\approx 2000$.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 describe one atom excitation decay in completely homogeneous clouds.  In this case, the frequency of emitted photon lies in the absorption band of the surrounding atoms. Consider now the case of spontaneous emission of a foreign atom embedded in a dense ensemble when this atom and atoms of the medium have essentially different transition frequencies.\n\nWe will choose parameters of the cloud's atoms in such a way that the dielectric constant would be real with a good accuracy.  It gives us possibility to compare our results obtained in the framework of our quantum microscopic approach with different models suggested earlier.\n\nWe can neglect imaginary part of dielectric constant if $Im(\\varepsilon(\\omega))\\ll Re(\\varepsilon(\\omega))-1$ for all frequencies emitted by the impurity atoms. It is known that for large detuning from resonance $Re(\\varepsilon(\\omega))-1$ is inversely proportional to $\\Delta$ whereas $Im(\\varepsilon(\\omega))$ is inversely proportional to $\\Delta^{2}$. So to have the possibility to satisfy corresponding inequality we have to choose $\\omega_{emb}-\\omega_0$ several times greater than $\\gamma_{0}$. The width of emitted radiation should be relatively small so that necessary inequality would be satisfied not\nonly at $\\omega_{emb}$ but at all the spectral area of the radiation.\n\nThe detailed analysis performed on the basis of known dielectric permittivity of cold atomic ensembles \\cite{45}, \\cite{48} shows that the requirements formulated above are satisfied particularly for  $\\Delta=4\\gamma_{0}$ and $\\gamma_{emb}=0.1\\gamma_{0}$ for the atomic density $n=0.05$; and for $\\Delta=70\\gamma_{0}$ and $\\gamma_{emb}=2\\gamma_{0}$ for the atomic density $n=1$.\n\nFigure 3 shows the spontaneous decay dynamics of an atom embedded in an ensemble of atomic density $n=0.05$ and $n=1$ obtained in the framework of the quantum microscopic approach.

This approach does not allow one to take into account inter-atomic correlations quite correctly.\n\n\\subsection{Atomic transition spectrum}\nInteraction of a radiating atom with its surroundings causes not only modification of the decay constant but also a shift of the atomic transition. Moreover, this interaction can be the reason of fundamental distortion of the spectral line.\nAt present there is a whole number of theoretical works devoted to analysis of spectral properties of cold atomic clouds. Theory predicts that different observables have different spectral dependence for dense clouds and these dependencies transform differently as density increases. Thus, the spectrum of the dielectric permittivity of cold and dense atomic clouds has a blue shift \\cite{45}, \\cite{45h}.  The maximal probability to excite the dense ensemble is observed for a negative detuning of exciting radiation \\cite{46}.  The calculation of the total scattering cross section shows that the corresponding spectrum has several resonances \\cite{44}.  Two of them are red shifted, and the third is in the blue region. Spectral dependence of fluorescence also has complicated behavior. It depends both on direction of fluorescence and its polarization \\cite{44}.\nBy now density dependence of spectral properties of cold clouds has been studied in several experiments \\cite{15d}, \\cite{43},\\cite{43a}.  In these experiments laser induced fluorescence of atomic ensemble was studied. Experiments showed red shift and some distortion of excitation spectrum.\n\nIn experiment external laser radiation excites whole atomic ensemble. Different atoms in the cloud excite with different probabilities. Observed fluorescence is result of averaging of secondary radiation of all atoms. And it depends essentially on specific type of excitation.  For typical spatially inhomogeneous clouds main contribution comes from relatively dilute external regions. In such a case observed collective effects are weak and spatial inhomogeneity makes interpretation of experimental result more difficult.\n\nIn this paper we analyze decay of local excitation inside dense atomic ensemble. The transition spectrum can be described by inverse Fourier transformation of $b_{0}(t)$ (\\ref{2}).  It is completely determined by Fourier components of the resolvent matrix (\\ref{4}).\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n{$\\scalebox{0.38}{\\includegraphics*{fig4a.EPS}}$ }{$\\scalebox{0.38}{\n\\includegraphics*{fig4b.EPS}}$ }\n\\caption{(Color online) Atomic transition spectrum for different densities of atomic ensemble: absorbtion curve (a); dispersion curve (b)}\n\\end{center}\n\\par\n\\label{fig4}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure 4 shows the spectrum of an atomic transition in the case when the excited atom is identical to the surrounding ones.\nIt demonstrates that the absorption curve (Fig. 4.a) as well as the dispersion one (Fig. 4.b) are significantly modified in comparison with the classical Lorenz and dispersion curves typical for a free atom. The contours have relatively narrow peaks and wide wings. The maximum of the spectral line is shifted in lower frequency as compared with a free atom. The value of the shift and average width of the contour increases with density.\n\nIn our opinion one atom spectral response analyzed above can be the foundation of new practical method of studying of collective effects in dense media. Few atom excitations can be realized in experiment as it described in sec.II. It gives opportunity to create local excitation in deep part of dense ensemble and study directly single atom polarizability modified by resonant dipole-dipole interaction.  It will give additional information for further analysis of complicate influence of collective effects on the spectral properties of cold clouds. Relatively strong modification of spectrum allows us to hope that this method will be sensitive.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we show the transition line shapes of a foreign atom embedded in a homogeneous atomic ensemble. Distortion of the line shape here is noticeably weaker than in the case shown in Fig. 4. Such an effect is directly connected with weakening of dipole-dipole interaction between the embedded atom and atoms of the surrounding ensemble as the difference in resonance frequencies of these atoms increases.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n{$\\scalebox{0.38}{\\includegraphics*{fig5a.EPS}}$ }{$\\scalebox{0.38}{\n\\includegraphics*{fig5b.EPS}}$ }\n\\caption{(Color online) Atomic transition spectrum: absorbtion curve (a); dispersion curve (b); $\\gamma_{emb}=0.1\\gamma_{0}$; 1 -- $n=0.05,\\;\\Delta=+4\\gamma_0$; 2 -- $n=0.2,\\;\\Delta=+4\\gamma_0$; 3 -- $n=0.05,\\;\\Delta=-4\\gamma_0$; 4 -- $n=0.2,\\;\\Delta=-4\\gamma_0$}\n\\end{center}\n\\par\n\\label{fig5}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe influence of the dipole-dipole interaction is determined not only by the difference in absolute value of their resonance frequencies but also by the sign of the difference.

As the sign of the detuning changes, the sign of the line shift changes as well.\n\nSuch behavior of the level shift of an embedded atom can be illustrated by the example of diatomic system where the eigenstate problem is solved analytically \\cite{44a}.

The calculations were made for an atomic density $n=0.05$ and for three different $N$ -- $N=300$; $N=1000$ and $N=2000$. Hereafter in this paper we use the inverse wave number of the resonance probe radiation in vacuum $k_0^{-1}=c/\\omega_{0}$ as a unit of length.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n{$\\scalebox{0.4}{\\includegraphics*{fig1a.EPS}}$ }{$\\scalebox{0.4}{\n\\includegraphics*{fig1b.EPS}}$ }\n\\caption{(Color online) Spontaneous decay dynamics (a); time dependence of the effective spontaneous decay rate (b); $n=0.05$, $\\gamma_{emb}=\\gamma_{0}$, $\\Delta=0$}\n\\end{center}\n\\par\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure 1a demonstrates that the process of spontaneous decay in a dense atomic ensemble is described by a multi-exponential law. Initial state with only one excited atom can be expanded as a series over set of nonorthogonal eigenvectors of Green matrix for each random spatial configuration of the system. Among different collective quantum states in the considered ensemble there are both super- and sub-radiant ones. The former influences the spontaneous decay dynamics predominantly in the early stages; an atom inside the ensemble decays faster than a free atom. Even in the case of relatively small densities like $n=0.05$ the increasing in decay rate is important.  With time the role of sub-radiant states increases, resulting in a decrease in decay rate. For $t>1/\\gamma_{emb}$ this rate becomes less than that for free atoms (see Fig. 1b).\n\nThe specific type of decay dynamics for given density depends on the size of the atomic ensemble, i.e. on the number of atoms N in it. It is typical situation when sub and super radiant states manifest themselves in collective decay (for more detail see \\cite{AGK08}-\\cite{BPK12}). We have analyzed how the function $P_0(t)$ changes with $N$ and found that for small clouds when mean free path of photon less or comparable with linear size of atomic ensemble these changes are very essential. As $N$ and linear size increase the changes in $P_0(t)$  become more and more weak. This dependence has evident tendency to saturation.  Our calculation shows that for studied geometry for $n=0.05$ the curve $P_0(t)$ does not practically changes as $N$ becomes more than 300. So results obtained for $N>300$ can be used for description of single atom spontaneous decay inside any macroscopic ensemble with reasonable accuracy.\n\nIt is illustrated by the fig. 1a where we show time dependence of $P_0(t)$ for three different $N$. For times less or comparable with $3/\\gamma$ all three curves coincide with accuracy of calculations. Such behavior connects with specific initial condition considered in this paper (contrary to the cases studied in \\cite{AGK08}-\\cite{ BPK12}). Modification of decay rate of initially excited central atom is caused by radiation of this atom which is scattered back by atoms of environment. Results displayed in the fig.1a show that atoms of the cloud located far from central atom influence on decay faintly at this time interval. Slight discrepancy at bigger times when population $P_0(t)$ is already small, connects with the fact that lifetimes of the most long-lived collective states are very sensitive to specific spatial configuration of the cloud and for accurate averaging of corresponding dates volume of calculation  has to be increased immensely.\n\n\nIncreasing the density of surrounding atoms causes enhancement of collective effects and consequently more considerable modification of spontaneous decay.  This effect is illustrated by Fig. 2 which shows the dynamics of single atom excitation decay inside an ensemble with the atomic density $n=1$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n{$\\scalebox{0.4}{\\includegraphics*{fig2a.EPS}}$ }{$\\scalebox{0.4}{\n\\includegraphics*{fig2b.EPS}}$ }\n\\caption{(Color online) Spontaneous decay dynamics (a); time dependence of the effective spontaneous decay rate (b); $n=1$, $\\gamma_{emb}=\\gamma_{0}$, $\\Delta=0$, $N=2000$}\n\\end{center}\n\\par\n\\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt short times the decay constant is several times greater than for free atoms.  On the contrary, for $t>1/\\gamma_{emb}$ the decay process shown in Fig. 2 goes noticeably slower than in case of $n=0.05$.\n\nAs density increases the size of mesoscopic cloud for which we can neglect dependence $P_0(t)$ on $N$ is also increase. For $n=1$ we observed saturation for $N\\approx 2000$.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 describe one atom excitation decay in completely homogeneous clouds.  In this case, the frequency of emitted photon lies in the absorption band of the surrounding atoms. Consider now the case of spontaneous emission of a foreign atom embedded in a dense ensemble when this atom and atoms of the medium have essentially different transition frequencies.\n\nWe will choose parameters of the cloud's atoms in such a way that the dielectric constant would be real with a good accuracy.  It gives us possibility to compare our results obtained in the framework of our quantum microscopic approach with different models suggested earlier.\n\nWe can neglect imaginary part of dielectric constant if $Im(\\varepsilon(\\omega))\\ll Re(\\varepsilon(\\omega))-1$ for all frequencies emitted by the impurity atoms. It is known that for large detuning from resonance $Re(\\varepsilon(\\omega))-1$ is inversely proportional to $\\Delta$ whereas $Im(\\varepsilon(\\omega))$ is inversely proportional to $\\Delta^{2}$. So to have the possibility to satisfy corresponding inequality we have to choose $\\omega_{emb}-\\omega_0$ several times greater than $\\gamma_{0}$.

Besides decay dynamics, we analyze shifts of resonance as well as distortion of spectral shape of atomic transition. Two main cases are considered. First we study decay of atom identical to the surrounding ones. In addition we consider the case of an impurity atom, one with different properties than atoms of the surroundings.\n\nThe calculations were made on the basis of a quantum approach taking into account the vector nature of the electromagnetic field and Zeeman structure of atomic sublevels. A continuous medium approximation was not used. It allowed us to take into consideration random inhomogeneity of the atomic system and consequently the existing interatomic correlations.\n\nIt was shown that under the considered conditions, decay dynamics can be described by a multi exponential law. Instantaneous decay rate depends on time. At the beginning of the decay it is greater than decay constant of a free atom $\\gamma$. In due course the rate decreases and becomes less than $\\gamma$. We also found a noticeable distortion of the spectral shape of transition in comparison with the Lorentz profile typical for motionless free atoms.\n\nOur calculation confirmed expected results consisting in increasing environmental influence as parameters of emitting atom approach those of surrounding atoms.  Most significantly this influence manifests itself when the initially excited atom is identical to the other ones. Particularly, in this case the distortion of the transition is most prominent and the shift of resonance is maximal. The latter becomes comparable with the half-width of atomic transition even for relatively small density $n=0.05$.\n\nIn our opinion results obtained in this paper are very important for future improvement in quantum frequency standards based on optical transitions in cold atomic ensembles. In such standards all atoms are identical to each other and for optimization of these devices the density dependence of the main characteristics have to be taken into account.\n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank M.
