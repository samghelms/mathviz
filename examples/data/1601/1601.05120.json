Well-posed boundary conditions along with transparent boundary data are required at the boundary, which are difficult to construct and implement numerically. Standard methods for boundary treatment lead to spurious \u00d2reflections\u00d3 from the outer boundary and contaminate the solution. The standard \napproach currently in use by many communities is to place the outer boundary \nfar enough that these reflected spurious  \nwaves are unable to interfere with the physical solution. This approach makes the computational domain unnecessarily large and the computation very expensive. With the approach of compactification of the computational domain, one is able to \nextend the domain to infinity, thus offering a clean solution to this \nproblem. Second, because the compactified computational domains have a \nrather modest extent (in our simulations we set $S\\sim 20$)  one has the ability \nto perform computations with grid-resolutions that are enormously high at \nvery low cost. For instance, in this work we use uniform grid-spacings (in $\\rho$) on the scale\nof $1/2,000$. This dense computational grid allows us to obtain results which are accurate to $1\\%$. \n(In addition, we take full advantage of GPU-accelerated computing to perform our computations efficiently.)  \nThird, the compactification allows us to extract signals at  (future null) infinity ($\\mathscr{I}^+$) directly, because it is part of the computational domain. And finally, these coordinates also resolve the aforementioned instability problem. See Ref.~\\cite{ZengKha:2011} for more detail. \n\nNotably, our coordinates compactify $\\mathscr{I}^+$, thereby allow us to compactify the domain of computation without introducing reflection of the waves back into the interior region. This way, we  avoid one of the main difficulties associated with the compactification of spatial infinity.

Relatively little is known about the nature of BH singularities, including their physical and geometrical properties, the possibility of extension of the spacetime manifold beyond them, or the role played by quantum gravity. \n\nBased on properties of spherical toy models and of cosmological singularities in addition to perturbative and non-perturbative analysis of rotating BHs, it is believed that three types of singularities could exist, and possibly co-exist, inside realistic BHs: first, a BKL-type singularity \\cite{bkl}, a spacelike,  anisotropic, homogeneous and chaotic singularity, in which Kasner epochs alternate independently along different timelike approaches to the singularity; second, the Poisson-Israel mass-inflation singularity \\cite{poisson-israel}, a null and deformationally-weak singularity that evolves along the generators of the BH's Cauchy horizon, or ingoing inner horizon, because of the capture of future perturbations; and third, the Marolf-Ori singularity \\cite{marolf-ori}, a null shock-wave singularity that evolves along the generators of the outgoing inner horizon because of the capture of past perturbations.\n\nHere we are mostly concerned with the mass-inflation singularity inside rotating BHs, and specifically with the properties of the singularity in its early parts. \nThe mass-inflation singularity was simulated in fully nonlinear simulations for a spherical charged scalar-field toy model in Ref.~\\cite{brady-smith}, where the properties of its general features were confirmed. However, several key details of the features of the mass-inflation singularity that were predicted by perturbative analysis \\cite{ori-91} appeared to be inconsistent with the nonlinear results of \\cite{brady-smith}. This discrepancy was resolved by the careful simulations of Ref.~\\cite{burko-97}, which showed that in the early parts of the mass-inflation singularity perturbation analysis is highly reliable and accurate. The picture of the singularity structure in spherical, charged, scalar-field toy models is that of a spherical, null, weak singularity, which is accurately described by perturbation analysis at early times, and that propagates at the speed of light while its null generators  contract, until eventually it contracts to zero volume when the singularity becomes spacelike. The spacelike singularity found in spherical charged toy models is strong,  scalar-curvature, and monotonic \\cite{burko-99}, and is very different from the BKL singularity. The occurrence of the mass-inflation singularity in spherical symmetry was shown rigorously in \\cite{dafermos}. \n\nRealistic black holes are neither spherical nor charged. The evidence for the singularity structure inside rotating black holes is made mostly of linear and nonlinear perturbation analysis \\cite{ori-92,ori-99,ori-99a}, in addition to non-perturbative studies \\cite{brady-chambers,ori-flanagan,ori-1998}. The early parts of the mass-inflation singularity inside asymptotically-flat, vacuum, rotating BHs is the main topic of the present paper. We evolve a linearized gravitational field over a Kerr spacetime using the Teukolsky equation, and find the behavior of the (azimuthal modes of the) linearized Weyl scalars $\\psi_0$ and $\\psi_4$ in the Kinnersley tetrad, and of the linearized curvature scalar $K:=R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}R^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ approaching the mass-inflation singularity along an outgoing null direction. Since our code is a linear one, this paper cannot address inherently nonlinear phenomena such as the contraction of the null generators of the Cauchy horizon, the formation of a possible spacelike singularity, or the properties thereof. We can find, however, much about the early parts of the mass-inflation singularity. As detailed below, we first check, verify, or critique results found by perturbative \\cite{ori-99} and non-perturbative \\cite{brady-chambers} analyses, and then go beyond the latter and find additional phenomenology. This is the first numerical simulation for the dynamical  evolution of the gravitational field inside a perturbed spinning BH. \nAddressing the nonlinear questions requires nonlinear simulations of the full Einstein equations. With the coming of age of numerical relativity it is hoped that a new era of numerical geometrodynamics will commence. \n\n\nIn our numerical experiments we find the Teukolsky equation to be numerically unstable when expressed in the common Boyer-Lindquist  or ingoing Kerr coordinates. Indeed, already in Schwarzschild spacetime the Teukolsky equation for $\\Psi_0$, for spin $s=2$, in numerically unstable. (In Minkowski spacetime, it is the equation for $\\Psi_4$, for spin $s=-2$, which is unstable.) This numerical instability comes about because of the presence of terms in the Teukolsky equation that effectively act as anti-damping terms. This instability presents us with a challenge when exploring the singularity of a Kerr BH. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenoting the ingoing Kerr coordinates (${\\tilde t},r,\\theta,{\\tilde\\varphi}$) we define the dimensionless compactified hyperboloidal coordinates $(\\tau,\\rho,\\theta,{\\tilde\\varphi})$ by $\\tau := {\\tilde{t}}' - {r'}^2/({r'}+S) + 4 \\ln [S/({r'}+S)]$ and $\\rho :={r'}/[1+{r'}/S]$, where ${\\tilde{t}}':=\\tilde{t}/M$ and ${r'}:=r/M$. The free parameter $S$ controls the numerical domain and the foliation, and gives us some freedom in the number of grid points and the size of the time steps  \\cite{harms-2014}.  In these coordinates the horizons are located at \n$\\rho_\\pm = \\frac{ a^2 S +  S^2M^2 \\pm S^2 M\\sqrt{M^2 - a^2} } { a^2 + 2  S M^2 + S^2 M^2}\\,,$ and the PDE becomes mixed type hyperbolic-elliptic. Notice that $\\rho\\in [0,S)$ maps   the domain $r\\in [0,\\infty )$ one-to-one. Figure \\ref{Penrose} shows the coordinates on a Penrose diagram of a Kerr BH. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{PenroseDiagram1.eps}\n\\caption{The Penrose diagram for the domain of integration and the coordinates.

Our numerical scheme satisfies the CFL condition in practice. Part of the CFL condition is that if $v_{i+j-1}$ and $v_{i+j+1}$ are the retarded times of the two data points on which Cauchy data are specified, and $v$ is the retarded time at which we want to find the field, than the CFL condition requires that \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}{\\rm max}(v_{i+j-1},v_{i+j+1})-v>0\n\\, . \\tag{1}\n\\label{courant}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\rm max}(v_{i+j-1},v_{i+j+1})-v&gt;0\\,.{}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>max</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>j</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>0</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05120.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere \n$\\omega_{\\rm p}=m\\Omega_-$,  and where for the fastest-growing gravitational mode $\\alpha_{\\rm p}=7$.

Therefore, the difference between the two expressions for the curvature grows exponentially with retarded time. \n\nWe conjecture that the reason for this discrepancy between the perturbative results of Ref.~\\cite{ori-99} and our results is that \\cite{ori-99} finds $\\psi_0(u={\\rm const},v)$ and $\\psi_4(u,v={\\rm const})$, and uses these in order to calculate $K_{\\rm p}(u={\\rm const},v)$. This approach amounts to tacitly assuming that $\\psi_4(u={\\rm const},v)\\sim{\\rm const}$ asymptotically. As we show above in Fig.~\\ref{psi04} and in Table \\ref{table:psi4}, this tacit assumption is unrealized in our numerical simulations. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{curvature.eps}\n\\caption{The curvature scalar $R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}R^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ as a function of $v/M$ along an outgoing null ray on the equatorial plane approaching the Cauchy horizon.

The numerical simulation is shown with a solid curve, and the prediction of \\cite{ori-99} with a dashed curve.}\n\\label{kretch}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe note that this disagreement is based on the fit parameters for the Ansatz (\\ref{ansatz}). While this Ansatz for the fit functions fits the data very well, the data represent a rather short interval of retarded time. Consider, say, the hypothetical alternative Ansatz $\\psi_4(u={\\rm const},v)\\sim e^{-i\\omega v}\\, (e^{-v/mW}+A)$. If the parameter $A\\ll 1$ it is hard to find numerically a non-zero value for $A$ unless the interval in retarded time is very long. In our numerical simulations it is difficult to significantly increase the retarded-time interval: the function we solve for, $\\Delta^{-2}\\Psi_4$, grows exponentially with retarded time, and floating-point arithmetics limits the interval. \n\nConsequently, our data represent evolutions to $v/M=500$. In the context of external  perturbations this length of evolution typically allows for only a crude estimate of power law indices, even when combined with an evaluation of the local power index \\cite{burko-ori-97} and its extrapolation to infinite time. We believe this is the case also here, contributing to the disagreements reflected in Tables \\ref{table:psi0} and \\ref{table:psi4}. Specifically, our results do no depend on an Ansatz regarding the asymptotic form of the fields (such as assuming a Price law behavior at finite times along the EH), such that subdominant terms may still contribute. \n\nEven if the aforementioned retarded-time problem can be resolved, we face the fact that there is little  sense in continuing our evolution beyond the level that curvature become Planckian. While general relativistic nonlinear effects may be ignored at the early parts of the Cauchy horizon, we do not yet know what any quantum gravity effects may be. Our results may have important implications for the latter. \n\n\n\nIt will be interesting to use a similar code in order to study the behavior of fields along the Cauchy horizon, and also along and across the outgoing inner horizon. Further details of this work will appear elsewhere. \n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements} \nThe authors are indebted to Richard Price for discussions. \nG.K.~acknowledges research support from NSF Grants No.~PHY--1303724 and No.~PHY--1414440, and from the U.S.~Air Force agreement No.~10--RI--CRADA--09.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{hawking-penrose} S.~Hawking and G.F.R.~Ellis, {\\em The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time} (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK) (1973).\n\n\\bibitem{bkl} V.A.~Belinskii, I.M.~Khalatnikov, and E.M.~Lifshitz,  Advances in Physics {\\bf 19}, 525  (1970).\n\n\\bibitem{poisson-israel} E.~Poisson and W.~Israel, Phys.~Rev.~D {\\bf 41}, 1796 (1990).\n\n\\bibitem{marolf-ori} D.~Marolf and A.~Ori, Phys.~Rev.~D {\\bf 86}, 124026 (2012). \n\n\\bibitem{brady-smith} P.R.~Brady and J.D.~Smith, Phys.~Rev.~Lett. {\\bf 75}, 1256 (1995). \n\n\\bibitem{ori-91} A.~Ori, Phys.~Rev.~Lett. {\\bf 67}, 789 (1991).\n\n\\bibitem{burko-97} L.M.~Burko, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf 79}, 4958 (1997). \n\n\\bibitem{burko-99} L.M.~Burko, Phys.~Rev.~D {\\bf 59},  024011 (1998). \n\n\\bibitem{dafermos} M.~Dafermos, Comm.~Pure Appl.~Math.~{\\bf 58}, 0445 (2005).\n\n\\bibitem{ori-92} A.~Ori, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf 68}, 2117 (1992).\n\n\\bibitem{ori-99} A.~Ori, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf 83}, 5423 (1999). \n\n\\bibitem{ori-99a} A.~Ori, Phys.~Rev.
