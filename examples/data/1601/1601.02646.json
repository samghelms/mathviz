\n\\label{volume_galaxy}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{volume_galaxy} shows \n the absolute $r-$band magnitudes of individual compact group member galaxies \n as a function of redshift.\nThe sample galaxies are distributed over \n a redshift range $0.015 < z < 0.212$ and \n a magnitude range $-22.5 < M_{r} < -16.0$. \nThe plot shows no significant difference in redshift and magnitude distribution\n for $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact group galaxies.\nFor comparison, \n we plot the absolute $r-$band magnitudes of the Hickson compact group members. \nThe sample here extends to a higher redshift limit \n than the Hickson sample. \n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=80mm]{fig3.eps}\n\\caption{\n(a) The velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) vs. \n the redshift for

and $N=3$ compact groups, respectively. \n(b) and (c) show the redshift and velocity dispersion distributions \n for $N\\geq4$ compact groups (filled histogram) \n and $N=3$ compact groups (hatched histogram), respectively. }\n\\label{volume_group}\n\\end{figure}\n \nFigure \\ref{volume_group} shows the group velocity dispersion \n as a function of redshift. \nThe median redshift for our sample is $z=0.08$. \nThere are more $N=3$ compact groups than $N\\ge4$ groups at $z > 0.15$, \n but the most distant compact groups have  $N\\ge4$ at $z=0.211$. \nThere is actually no significant difference in the redshift distribution\n between the two types of compact groups. \nThe velocity dispersions of $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups appear\n to increase slightly with redshift,\n but the errors in the velocity dispersion are too large to identify a clear trend. \n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=80mm]{fig4.eps}\n\\caption{Velocity dispersion vs. total r-band luminosity of compact groups.\nCircles and starlets show\n compact groups in normal environments and \n compact groups within rich clusters, respectively. \nLighter colored symbols represent compact groups at higher redshifts. }\n\\label{lumsigma}\n\\end{figure} \n \nTo study the cause of the possible slight increase\n in the velocity dispersion of compact groups\n with redshift in Figure \\ref{volume_group},\n we plot the velocity dispersion of compact groups \n as a function of the total group $r-$band luminosity (Figure \\ref{lumsigma}).\nThe total luminosity is the sum of\n $r-$band luminosities of the members.\nThe velocity dispersion increases with total $r-$band luminosity;\n the correlation tests including \n Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's result in \n correlation coefficients of 0.27-0.38 \n with the two-sided significance of $\\sim0$,\n indicating a weak, but significant correlation. \nThe distribution for compact groups near galaxy clusters \n does not differ from the other groups. \nAt higher redshift,\n compact groups containing only low luminosity member galaxies\n are undetectable because the limiting absolute magnitude changes with redshift.\nThus compact groups at higher redshifts tend to have greater total luminosities\n and larger velocity dispersion than nearby compact groups.\nThe slight increase in the velocity dispersion of compact groups with redshift\n in Figure \\ref{volume_group}\n reflects the greater total luminosity of the higher redshift systems.\nWhen we examine the velocity dispersions and \n total luminosities of the DPOSS II compact groups, \n the compact groups at higher redshift also have larger velocity dispersion \n and greater luminosity for the same reason.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Morphological Content}\n\nWe next examine the morphological content of compact groups.  \nBoth $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups show \n larger fractions of early-type galaxies than  late-type galaxies (Table \\ref{tab:morph}):  \n $65.3 \\pm 1.7\\%$ and $56.0 \\pm 2.3\\%$ of $N\\ge4$ and \n $N=3$ compact group galaxies are early types, respectively. \nIn total, $62.1 \\pm 1.4\\%$ of compact group galaxies are early types. \nThis fraction  slightly exceeds  the fraction of early-type galaxies \n in the Hickson compact groups ($51 \\pm 2\\%$, \\citealp{Hic88}), \n but it is smaller than the fraction in the DPOSS II compact groups ($81\\%$, \\citealp{Pom12}). \nHowever, the early- and late-type galaxies in the DPOSS II compact groups \n are classified based on H$\\alpha$ equivalent width, \n different from the morphological approach we take.  \nTherefore, direct comparison is not possible. \nThe fraction of early-type galaxies in our compact groups is \n similar to the fraction in local galaxy clusters \\citep{Par09}. \n \n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\caption{Morphological Composition of the Sample Compact

fraction of early-type galaxies appears\n to decrease with groupcentric radius in the range\n $0 < R_{projected} < 70 ~h^{-1}$ kpc\n for both $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups.\nHowever, the fraction in the outermost region \n at $70 < R_{projected} < 150 ~h^{-1}$ kpc is \n as high as the fraction in the very inner region.\nBecause we have a similar number of galaxies in each radial bin,\n this behavior does not simply result from small number statistics.\n \nWe also examine the velocity dispersion of \n early- and late-type galaxies\n as a function of groupcentric distance.\nThe dispersion profiles do not change much\n with groupcentric radius except for the innermost region of $N=3$ compact groups.\nThis result differs from dispersion profiles \n for galaxy clusters that typically increase \n with decreasing clustercentric radius \\citep{Mah99, Biv04, Hwa08},\n but on much larger scale.\n\nFigure \\ref{rfrac} shows that \n we can explore the radial dependence of properties of compact groups\n (including the early-type fraction and velocity dispersion)\n in a radial range $0 < R_{projected} < 150 ~h^{-1}$ kpc. \nThis small range is interesting because it is hard to sample in any other systems.\nThe scale is, for example, comparable to or smaller than \n the typical size of the brightest cluster galaxies ($\\sim 100$ kpc, \\citealp{New13, Lop14}). \nThe morphological properties of galaxies in these small dense regions\n may ultimately provide interesting tests of processes involved in galaxy evolution.\n \n\\subsubsection{The Abundance of Compact

galaxy survey.\nAlthough the $N\\geq3$ incomplete compact groups are not included\n in our compact group catalog,\n they are useful for determining the abundance of $N\\ge3$ compact groups.\nBecause we use a magnitude-limited sample of galaxies to identify compact groups,\n the variation in the absolute magnitude limit as a function of redshift\n affects the observed space density of compact groups.\n\nTo correct for this effect,\n we follow the method of \\citet{Bar96},\n who computed the abundance of compact groups\n identified by applying a friends-of-friends method\n to the magnitude-limited sample of CfA2+SSRS2 redshift survey data \n \\citep{Gel89, Gio85, daC94}. \n\\citet{Bar96} assumed  that the galaxies in their sample compact groups\n are randomly drawn from a magnitude distribution $\\overline{\\Phi}(M)$.\nThey then calculated $P_{i}$,\n the probability for detecting $i$th brightest member of a compact group\n in the absolute magnitude range $[M, M+dM]$.\nThe $P_{i}$ is proportional to $P_{(i-1) < M}(M)\\overline{\\Phi}(M)dM$,\n where $P_{(i-1) < M}(M)$ is the probability that $i-1$ group members are brighter than $M$.\nThey derived the $P_{(i-1) < M}(M)$ from the Poisson distribution:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\n\\jkashead \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{INTRODUCTION\\label{sec:intro}}\n\nCompact groups of galaxies

than those of clusters \n ($500 - 1000~ {\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, \\citealp{Rin06,Hwa12}),\n but comparable with many loose groups \\citep{Ein03}.  \nThe high density, low velocity dispersion, and short crossing time of compact groups\n make them a test-bed for the study of  galaxy interactions\n (e.g. \\citealp{Hic92, MdO94, Bit11, Soh13, Bit14, Fed15}).\n\nThe physical processes important for\n the formation and evolution of compact groups remain unclear.\nThe mere survival of these systems for times\n much longer than a few crossing times has been a long-standing puzzle.\nSeveral numerical simulations showed that\n galaxies within a compact group should merge and\n the group should thus disappear \\citep{Bar85,Bar89,Mam87}.\nIn fact, \\citet{Bar89} proposed that \n compact group galaxies merge into a single elliptical galaxy\n on a very short time scale ($< 0.02$ Hubble time),\n comparable with the observed crossing time \\citep{Hic92,Pom12}.\nOther simulations suggested that\n compact groups can survive much longer than the crossing time\n \\citep{Gov91, Ath97}.\n\\citet{Gov91} showed that\n for galaxies with a mass range appropriate to compact groups,\n some group members may remain in quasi-stable orbits for billions of years.\n\\citet{Ath97} suggested that\n compact groups survive because the galaxies are embedded in a common halo. \nIn yet another picture,\n \\citet{Dia94} proposed that\n compact groups form within a single rich loose group and\n they can thus acquire new members from the surrounding environment\n thus lengthening their apparent lifetime.\nThe number density of compact groups as a function of epoch\n may thus depend not only on the merger rate of galaxies within them\n but also on the replenishment with new members accreted from the surroundings.\n\nThe environments of compact groups are\n an important clue to understand their formation and evolution.\nKnown compact groups inhabit a range of environments\n ranging from clusters and rich groups to low density regions.\n\\citet{Ram94} found that\n 76\\% of a sample of 38 Hickson compact groups are embedded in rich groups. \nSeveral studies showed that \n a significant fraction of compact groups \n are embedded in clusters, rich groups, less dense poor groups and\n in the surrounding larger-scale structures \\citep{Roo94, Rib98, And05, Men11, Pom12}. \nIn some of these studies neither the compact group candidates nor the environments\n have complete redshift measurements (e.g. see the discussion by \\citealp{Men11}). \nA fuller understanding of the environmental issues\n affecting the formation and evolution of compact groups\n requires complete spectroscopy of compact group candidates\n within a large volume redshift survey. \n \nThe abundance of compact groups as a function of redshift is\n also a potential constraint on the evolution of these systems.\nFor example,\n \\citet{Kro15} suggested that \n the abundance of compact groups should decline significantly over a 1 Gyr timescale\n for halos composed of exotic dark matter particles. \nThe suggestion by \\citet{Kro15} tacitly assumes\n that compact groups do not accrete new members from the environment\n in contrast with the model proposed by \\citet{Dia94}. \nTo date there are no direct observational measures\n of the space density evolution of compact groups to test these conjectures.  \n \nThere have been several attempts to construct larger catalogs of compact groups\n \\citep{Ros77,Hic82,Pra94,Iov03,Lee04,deC05,McC09}. \n\\citet{Hic82} published a widely used catalog of 100 compact groups.\n\\citet{McC09} used Hickson's criteria to identify compact groups \n in the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 6 \n (DR6, \\citealp{Ade08}). \nCurrently the sample of \\citet{McC09} is the largest catalog of compact group candidates\n with 77,088 tentative groups.\nHowever, at least 55\\% of the compact group candidates\n from the magnitude-limited sample of $14.5 \\leq r \\leq 18.0$\n could be contaminated by interlopers\n as a result of their selection based on photometric data.\nThis interloper fraction may be greater\n  for their faint sample compact groups with $14.5 \\leq r \\leq 21.0$. \n\nRedshift surveys of compact group candidates provide\n a basis for cleaner catalogs\n better suited to testing models \n for the formation and evolution of these systems \\citep{Hic92,Pom12}. \n\\citet{Hic92} showed that\n 69 of the 100 compact groups in his original catalog \n include four or more members with accordant redshifts. \nSimilarly, \n \\citet{Pom12} observed 138 compact group candidates\n drawn from the second digital Palomar Observatory Sky Survey \\citep{Iov03,deC05}; \n 96 of these contain three or more galaxies with accordant redshifts \n (DPOSS II compact groups hereafter).\nThe 70\\% success rate for these two catalogs underscores \n the importance of spectroscopic observations \n for constructing a robust sample of compact groups. \n \nWe conduct a spectroscopic survey of compact group candidates in the SDSS DR6\n to construct an updated sample of compact groups with complete redshifts.\nBy adding 2066 redshifts, \n we construct the largest catalog of compact groups with complete spectroscopic redshifts.\nBased on this sample, \n we examine the physical properties of compact groups including\n size, velocity dispersion, space density and local environment. \nWe compare these properties with the Hickson and the DPOSS II groups.  \nWe show that the physical characteristics\n of the groups in our catalog are not a strong function of the redshift of the system. \nWe also estimate the space density of compact groups\n as a function of redshift for the range $0.01 < z < 0.22$.\nThese estimates are a first step toward using the space density\n as a test of models for the evolution of these systems.\n\nSection 2 describes the basic sample used to construct the compact group catalog. \nSection 3 explains the method of identifying compact group members\n once the redshifts are measured.\nWe examine the physical properties of the sample compact groups with complete redshifts \n and compare them with other compact group catalogs in \\S 4.\nWe summarize in \\S 5. \nThroughout, we adopt  $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters \n $H_{0} = 100~ h ~\\rm km ~\\rm s^{-1} ~\\rm Mpc^{-1}$, \n $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.7$, and\n $\\Omega_{m}=0.3$. \nWe use $H_{0} = 100~ h ~\\rm km ~\\rm s^{-1} ~\\rm Mpc^{-1}$\n to facilitate comparison with earlier work.\n\n\n\\section{DATA}\n\n\\subsection{Parent Sample}\n\\citet{McC09} used Hickson's criteria \\citep{Hic82} \n to identify compact group candidates \n in the photometric sample of SDSS DR6 galaxies. \nHickson's criteria can be expressed as follows:\n $N (\\Delta m < 3) \\geq 4$, $R_{N} \\geq 3 R_{G}$, and \n $\\mu_{gr} < 26.0~ {\\rm mag~arcsec}^{-2}$. \n$N (\\Delta m < 3)$ means \n the total number of member candidate galaxies \n within 3 mag of the brightest galaxy in a system.\n$R_{G}$ is the angular size of the smallest circle containing all members, \n and $R_{N}$ is the angular size of the largest circle that includes no additional galaxies \n within 3 mag of the brightest galaxy. \n$\\mu_{gr}$ is the mean surface brightness within the circle of radius $R_{G}$. \n\\citet{McC09} constructed two catalogs of compact group candidates\n with different magnitude limits:\n catalog A with $14.5 \\leq r \\leq 18.0$ and \n catalog B with $14.5 \\leq r \\leq 21.0$. \nCatalog A and catalog B list 2297 and 74,791 compact group candidates\n with 9713 and 313,508 tentative member galaxies, respectively. \n\nHere we use catalog A as a parent sample.\nDespite the bright magnitude limit for catalog A,\n only a small fraction of group candidates in the catalog\n were previously confirmed as genuine compact groups\n based on spectroscopic redshifts. \nThere are only 70 complete compact groups in the catalog \n containing four or more members \n with velocity difference from the mean group velocity\n less than $1000~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ (see Table \\ref{tab:obsstat}). \n\n\n\\subsection{Redshift Data}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=80mm]{fig1.eps}\n\\caption{\n(a) The $g-r$ vs. $r$ color magnitude diagram of FLWO/FAST

in the fields of compact group candidates \n in catalog A of \\citet{McC09} (see their Table 3). \nAmong the candidate group galaxies, \n we primarily targeted galaxies in groups \n that already have two or three members with measured redshifts. \nWe then ranked the targets by their apparent magnitude; \n the targets have $r-$band magnitudes in the range $14.2 < r < 17.0$.\nTo avoid other selection effects, we did not use any selection criteria other than apparent magnitude. \nFigure \\ref{cmd} shows the color-magnitude diagram for the target galaxies.  \nWe use the extinction-corrected Petrosian magnitudes from the SDSS DR12. \nWe also plot the compact group galaxies \n identified with  SDSS DR6 and DR12 redshift data. \nThe FAST target galaxies are generally brighter than\n compact group galaxies with the SDSS redshifts. \nThe color distribution of compact group galaxies  peaks at $g-r \\sim 0.8$. \n\nWe obtained long-slit spectra of 193 galaxies \n with the FAST spectrograph \\citep{Fab98} \n installed on the 1.5m Tillinghast telescope\n at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO)\n from 2013 May to 2014 May.\nWe used a long slit with a 3 arcsec width and a 300 line grating \n providing spectral resolution of $2.94~{\\rm \\AA}$ and \n a dispersion of $1.47~\\rm \\AA$ pixel$^{-1}$. \nThe spectra cover the wavelength range $3470-7420~\\rm\\AA$. \nThe exposure times range from 900 to 1800 s \n depending on the brightness of the target galaxy. \nWe reduced the data using IRAF. \nWe measure the redshift of each galaxy with\n the {\\it rvsao} \\citep{Kur98} task. \nDuring the pipeline processing, \n we assign a quality flag of `Q' for high-quality redshifts,\n '?' for marginal cases, and 'X' for poor fits.  \nWe obtained 193 spectra in this study. \nAmong these,\n five have an 'X' flag and three have a '?' flag.\nWe exclude these eight objects from the analysis. \nThe typical velocity measurement error for \n the FAST spectra of compact group galaxies is $22~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$.\n \nWe supplement these data with redshifts \n from the literature (see \\citealp{Hwa10} for details) \n including the FAST archive and the SDSS DR12 \\citep{Ala15}.\nThere are two redshifts from FAST observations between 2006 and 2008 measured as part of \n an unpublished study of low-redshift clusters and groups (P.I.: K. Rines).\nThere are 161 and 1718 new redshifts from the literature and SDSS DR12\n for galaxies in the fields of compact group candidates in \\citet{McC09}. \nThe total number of redshifts we add to the \\citet{McC09} catalog is 2066.\n\n\\section{A SAMPLE OF COMPACT GROUPS WITH REDSHIFTS}\n\nWe combine the 2066 additional redshifts \n with the existing data for galaxies in the fields of compact group candidates\n in \\citet{McC09}.\nWe determine compact group membership based only on galaxies \n with a spectroscopic redshift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n\\caption{Statistics of Sample

velocity differences \n between member candidates and the median redshift, and\n remove foreground and background galaxies \n with line-of-sight velocity differences larger than $1500 ~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$. \nWe use the mean velocity of the remaining group galaxies \n as a group systemic redshift. \nWe finally select member galaxies in each group\n with concordant redshifts of $|v_{galaxy} - v_{group}| \\leq 1000 ~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, \n following the velocity separation of CG galaxies \n used in previous studies \\citep{Hic92, Men11, Pom12}.  \nTo check the reliability of the cutoff velocity $1000~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, \n we test the group selection \n with the larger cutoff velocities of $1500~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ and $2000~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$. \nWith the larger cutoff velocities, \n only a few additional compact group candidates are newly identified as true compact groups. \nThus we use cutoff velocity $1000~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ \n for direct comparison with other compact groups based on the same cutoff. \n\nWe adopt galaxy morphology information for the compact group galaxies \n from the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) DR7 value-added catalog (VAGC) \\citep{Choi10}. \n\\citet{Choi10} classified early- and late-type galaxies \n using the $u-r$ color, the $g-i$ color gradient, \n and the $i$ band concentration index \n following the automatic classification scheme suggested by \\citet{Par05}. \nWe visually classify the morphology of galaxies \n not included in the KIAS DR7 VAGC using the SDSS images. \n\nThere are three types of compact groups\n in our spectroscopic sample:\n groups with four or more members ($N\\ge4$ compact groups hereafter), \n groups with three members ($N=3$ compact groups hereafter), and\n incomplete groups with three confirmed members plus \n one or more tentative member galaxies \n with unknown redshifts ($N\\geq3$ incomplete compact groups hereafter).\nWe do not use these $N\\geq3$ incomplete groups for further analysis \n except when computing the group abundance.\nIt is unclear whether \n these $N\\geq3$ incomplete groups would be confirmed as $N\\geq4$ or $N=3$ groups; \n thus we do not include them in the analysis. \nHowever, these incomplete groups remain useful \n for determining the abundance of $N\\ge3$ compact groups. \nThe incomplete compact groups consist of at least three member galaxies and \n this satisfy our compact group selection criteria. \nThus, we include them only when we compute the group abundance. \n \n\\citet{Hic82} originally defined compact groups \n with $N\\ge4$ members rather than with $N\\ge3$ members. \n\\citet{Dup13} compared the properties (i.e. stellar mass, star formation rate and color) \n of compact triplets with those of larger compact group candidates. \nThey concluded that galaxy triplets do not differ from more populated compact groups,\n but they do differ from galaxy pairs and clusters. \nMany previous studies have included $N=3$ compact groups \n when all three galaxies have measured redshifts confirming their membership.\nWe thus include the $N=3$ compact groups.\n\nTable \\ref{tab:obsstat} summarizes our compact group selection. \nIn the original catalog of \\citet{McC09}, \n there are 70 $N\\ge4$ and 55 $N=3$ genuine compact groups \n with 291 and 165 members, respectively.\nBy adding the SDSS DR12 data, \n the number of compact groups increases to \n 164 $N\\ge4$ and 125 $N=3$ compact groups\n with 685 and 375 members, respectively. \nFinally our FLWO/FAST observations contribute an\n additional 28 $N\\ge4$ and 15 $N=3$ complete compact groups \n for a final sample of \n 192 $N\\ge4$ and 140 $N=3$ compact groups with \n 799 and 420 member galaxies, respectively.\nAmong the $N\\ge4$ compact groups, \n there are 164, 26, 1 and 1 groups with $N=4,5,6$ and 7 members.\nWe also identified $395~N\\geq3$ incomplete compact groups \n with a total of 1185 member galaxies. \nThe number of compact groups with complete spectroscopic redshifts in this study\n is about three times larger than the number in the original \\citet{McC09} catalog.\n\nThe new redshift data also identify \n many chance alignments among the compact group candidates of \\citet{McC09}.\nThere are 144 and 9 compact group candidates \n that turn out to be chance alignments of galaxies with discordant redshifts\n based on the SDSS DR12 and FLWO/FAST data, respectively. \nThis substantial number of chance alignments clearly underscores\n the importance of spectroscopic redshifts \n for reducing the contamination the compact

\n\\label{volume_galaxy}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{volume_galaxy} shows \n the absolute $r-$band magnitudes of individual compact group member galaxies \n as a function of redshift.\nThe sample galaxies are distributed over \n a redshift range $0.015 < z < 0.212$ and \n a magnitude range $-22.5 < M_{r} < -16.0$. \nThe plot shows no significant difference in redshift and magnitude distribution\n for $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact group galaxies.\nFor comparison, \n we plot the absolute $r-$band magnitudes of the Hickson compact group members. \nThe sample here extends to a higher redshift limit \n than the Hickson sample. \n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=80mm]{fig3.eps}\n\\caption{\n(a) The velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) vs. \n the redshift for $N\\geq4$ compact groups (circles) and for\n $N=3$ compact groups (triangles).\nThe solid and dashed lines represent \n the trend after the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression smoothing \n for $N\\geq4$ and $N=3$ compact groups, respectively. \n(b) and (c) show the redshift and velocity dispersion distributions \n for $N\\geq4$ compact groups (filled histogram) \n and $N=3$ compact groups (hatched histogram), respectively. }\n\\label{volume_group}\n\\end{figure}\n \nFigure \\ref{volume_group} shows the group velocity dispersion \n as a function of redshift. \nThe median redshift for our sample is $z=0.08$. \nThere are more $N=3$ compact groups than $N\\ge4$ groups at $z > 0.15$, \n but the most distant compact groups have  $N\\ge4$ at $z=0.211$. \nThere is actually no significant difference in the redshift distribution\n between the two types of compact groups. \nThe velocity dispersions of $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups appear\n to increase slightly with redshift,\n but the errors in the velocity dispersion are too large to identify a clear trend. \n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=80mm]{fig4.eps}\n\\caption{Velocity dispersion vs. total r-band luminosity of compact groups.\nCircles and starlets show\n compact groups in normal environments and \n compact groups within rich clusters, respectively. \nLighter colored symbols represent compact groups at higher redshifts. }\n\\label{lumsigma}\n\\end{figure} \n \nTo study the cause of the possible slight increase\n in the velocity dispersion of compact groups\n with redshift in Figure \\ref{volume_group},\n we plot the velocity dispersion of compact groups \n as a function of the total group $r-$band luminosity (Figure \\ref{lumsigma}).\nThe total luminosity is the sum of\n $r-$band luminosities of the members.\nThe velocity dispersion increases with total $r-$band luminosity;\n the correlation tests including \n Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's result in \n correlation coefficients of 0.27-0.38 \n with the two-sided significance of $\\sim0$,\n indicating a weak, but significant correlation. \nThe distribution for compact groups near galaxy clusters \n does not differ from the other groups. \nAt higher redshift,\n compact groups containing only low luminosity member galaxies\n are undetectable because the limiting absolute magnitude changes with redshift.\nThus compact groups at higher redshifts tend to have greater total luminosities\n and larger velocity dispersion than nearby compact groups.\nThe slight increase in the velocity dispersion of compact groups with redshift\n in Figure \\ref{volume_group}\n reflects the greater total luminosity of the higher redshift systems.\nWhen we examine the velocity dispersions and \n total luminosities of the DPOSS II compact groups, \n the compact groups at higher redshift also have larger velocity dispersion \n and greater luminosity for the same reason.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Morphological Content}\n\nWe next examine the morphological content of compact groups.  \nBoth $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups show \n larger fractions of early-type galaxies than  late-type galaxies (Table \\ref{tab:morph}):  \n $65.3 \\pm 1.7\\%$ and $56.0 \\pm 2.3\\%$ of $N\\ge4$ and \n $N=3$ compact group galaxies are early types, respectively. \nIn total, $62.1 \\pm 1.4\\%$ of compact group galaxies are early types. \nThis fraction  slightly exceeds  the fraction of early-type galaxies \n in the Hickson compact groups ($51 \\pm 2\\%$, \\citealp{Hic88}), \n but it is smaller than the fraction in the DPOSS II compact groups ($81\\%$, \\citealp{Pom12}). \nHowever, the early- and late-type galaxies in the DPOSS II compact groups \n are classified based on H$\\alpha$ equivalent width, \n different from the morphological approach we take.  \nTherefore, direct comparison is not possible. \nThe fraction of early-type galaxies in our compact groups is \n similar to the fraction in local galaxy clusters \\citep{Par09}. \n \n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\caption{Morphological Composition of the Sample Compact

compact groups. \nWe use the group centers in Table \\ref{tab:grcat} (i.e. R.A., Decl. and redshift) \n to compute the groupcentric radial velocities and \n the projected groupcentric distances of member galaxies. \nWe then superimpose the groups directly in Figure \\ref{rvcg}. \nWe distinguish early- and late-type galaxies \n with different symbols (open circles and triangles).\nThe distribution of projected groupcentric radius\n for early- and late-type galaxies are similar. \nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test cannot reject the hypothesis that \n the radial distributions of the two samples are extracted from the same parent population.\nThe Anderson-Darling (A-D) test \n gives a result similar to  the K-S test.\nThe distributions of the rest-frame groupcentric velocities also show\n no significant difference.\nThe velocity dispersions of early- and late-type galaxies\n for $N\\ge4$ compact groups are similar, \n $259~\\pm~9~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ and $266~\\pm~14~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, respectively. \nThese results differ from galaxy clusters that \n typically show higher velocity dispersions\n for the more centrally concentrated early-type galaxies relative to late-type galaxies \n \\citep{Col96,Mah99,Hwa08}.\nHowever, \\citet{Rin13} showed that \n the velocity distributions of the blue and red galaxies in galaxy clusters\n are not significantly different,

early-type galaxies \n as a function of projected groupcentric distance \n for $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups.\nWe set the bin size to include a similar number of galaxies in each bin.\nThe fraction of early-type galaxies appears\n to decrease with groupcentric radius in the range\n $0 < R_{projected} < 70 ~h^{-1}$ kpc\n for both $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups.\nHowever, the fraction in the outermost region \n at $70 < R_{projected} < 150 ~h^{-1}$ kpc is \n as high as the fraction in the very inner region.\nBecause we have a similar number of galaxies in each radial bin,\n this behavior does not simply result from small number statistics.\n \nWe also examine the velocity dispersion of \n early- and late-type galaxies\n as a function of groupcentric distance.\nThe dispersion profiles do not change much\n with groupcentric radius except for the innermost region of $N=3$ compact groups.\nThis result differs from dispersion profiles \n for galaxy clusters that typically increase \n with decreasing clustercentric radius \\citep{Mah99, Biv04, Hwa08},\n but on much larger scale.\n\nFigure \\ref{rfrac} shows that \n we can explore the radial dependence of properties of compact groups\n (including the early-type fraction and velocity dispersion)\n in a radial range $0 < R_{projected} < 150 ~h^{-1}$ kpc. \nThis small range is interesting because it is hard to sample in any other systems.\nThe scale is, for example, comparable to or smaller than \n the typical size of the brightest cluster galaxies ($\\sim 100$ kpc, \\citealp{New13, Lop14}). \nThe morphological properties of galaxies in these small dense regions\n may ultimately provide interesting tests of processes involved in galaxy evolution.\n \n\\subsubsection{The Abundance of Compact

galaxy survey.\nAlthough the $N\\geq3$ incomplete compact groups are not included\n in our compact group catalog,\n they are useful for determining the abundance of $N\\ge3$ compact groups.\nBecause we use a magnitude-limited sample of galaxies to identify compact groups,\n the variation in the absolute magnitude limit as a function of redshift\n affects the observed space density of compact groups.\n\nTo correct for this effect,\n we follow the method of \\citet{Bar96},\n who computed the abundance of compact groups\n identified by applying a friends-of-friends method\n to the magnitude-limited sample of CfA2+SSRS2 redshift survey data \n \\citep{Gel89, Gio85, daC94}. \n\\citet{Bar96} assumed  that the galaxies in their sample compact groups\n are randomly drawn from a magnitude distribution $\\overline{\\Phi}(M)$.\nThey then calculated $P_{i}$,\n the probability for detecting $i$th brightest member of a compact group\n in the absolute magnitude range $[M,

abundance of compact groups\n does not change in the redshift range $0.00 < z < 0.03$\n when the compact groups are identified directly from\n a spectroscopic sample of galaxies using the friends-of-friends algorithm.\n\\cite{Kro15} suggested that\n there would be more compact groups 1 Gyr ago (e.g. $z\\sim0.1$)\n than in the current universe\n if compact groups collapse into a single elliptical galaxies\n on a short timescale.\nOur results suggest that the space density of compact groups does not\n change significantly with redshift.\nThus compact groups either survive longer than 1 Gyr or\n they are replenished with galaxies from the surrounding region.\n \n\\subsection{Comparison with Other Compact Group Samples}\nTo compare the physical properties of the compact groups \n in this study with those in previous studies,\n we use samples of compact groups \n based on similar selection criteria and on redshift survey data:\n Hickson compact groups \\citep{Hic92} and DPOSS II compact groups \\citep{Pom12}. \nThe Hickson compact groups are in the redshift range $0.003 < z < 0.333$ and \n they include member galaxies with $r < 19.5$.\nThe DPOSS II compact groups span \n a redshift range $0.044 < z < 0.233$ and\n the magnitudes of the member galaxies are $r < 19.0$.\n\nBoth samples are based on Hickson\u00a1\u00afs selection criteria, \n but the selection criteria for the DPOSS II compact groups differ slightly from Hickson's.\n\\citet{Iov03} and \\citet{deC05} used: \n $N(\\Delta m <2) \\geq 4$, \n $R_{N} \\geq 3 R_{G}$, and \n $\\mu_{G} \\leq 24.0 {\\rm ~mag ~arcsec}^{-2}$.  \nThese criteria differ from Hickson's  in several ways. \nFirst, Hickson used $N(\\Delta m < 3)$ rather than $N(\\Delta m <2)$, \n where $N(\\Delta m <2)$ refers to the total number of galaxies \n within 2 mag of the brightest member galaxy. \nSecond, $R_{N}$ in Hickson's criteria \n is the angular size of the smallest circle encompassing no additional galaxies \n within 3 mag of the brightest group member, \n while $R_{N}$ for the DPOSS II compact groups is \n the angular size of the largest circle that includes no additional galaxies \n within 0.5 mag of the faintest group member. \nThe definitions of $R_{G}$ are the same.\nThird, the mean surface brightness limit for Hickson's criteria is \n $26.0 {\\rm ~mag ~arcsec}^{-2}$ \n rather than $24.0 {\\rm ~mag ~ arcsec}^{-2}$. \nThese differences \n between the DPOSS II and the Hickson account for\n some of the differences in the physical properties of compact groups in the two samples.

}\n\\label{cone}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{cone} displays \n an example of the spatial distribution of compact groups\n relative to the surrounding large-scale structure\n for a slice of $9^{h} < \\alpha_{2000} < 16^{h}$ and\n $12.5^{\\circ} < \\delta_{2000} < 13.5^{\\circ}$.\nWe choose this slice \n to show various environments of compact groups \n even though there are only four compact groups in this thin slice. \nTo show homogeneous structures of galaxies regardless of redshift,\n we plot galaxies in a volume-limited sample\n with $M_{r} < -20.5$ and $0.00 < z < 0.14$\n (see the large box in Figure \\ref{volume_galaxy}).\nAs expected based on previous studies of smaller samples \n \\citep{Roo94, Ram94, Rib98, And05, Pom12}, \n the environments of compact groups are diverse (Figure \\ref{env}).\n\nIn Table \\ref{tab:grcat}, \n we examine the number of compact groups located near galaxy clusters. \nUsing NED and requiring \n $|v_{group} - v_{cluster}| < 3000~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ and $R_{projected} < 1~h^{-1}$ Mpc,\n only 69 (21\\%) of our sample compact groups are near known massive clusters.\nWith more relaxed criteria, \n $|v_{group} - v_{cluster}| < 6000~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ and \n $R_{projected} < 1~h^{-1}$ Mpc \\citep{Men11}, \n the number of compact groups near known massive clusters changes little to 80 (i.e. 24\\%).\nThese fractions are smaller than those\n in previous studies; \n e.g., 35\\% in \\citet{Pom12} and 50\\% in \\citet{Men11} based on similar criteria.\n\\citet{Men11} used  compact groups identified with photometric redshifts \n and $N > 4$ galaxy groups from the SDSS DR7 \\citep{Tag10}\n to study the local environments of compact groups.\nIn contrast, we use only compact groups with complete spectroscopic redshifts\n and known massive galaxy clusters listed in NED; \n thus our criteria are stricter than in other studies. \nThe more restrictive criteria result in \n the lower fraction of compact groups within known massive clusters. \n\nWe also investigate the local environments of our sample compact groups \n using the parameter, $\\Sigma_{5}$,\n and compare them with the environments of the Hickson and the DPOSS II compact groups. \n$\\Sigma_{5}$ is the surface number density defined as \n $\\Sigma_{5} = 5 (\\pi D_{p,5}^{2})^{-1}$,\n where $D_{p,5}$ is the projected distance \n between the center of the compact group and the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy. \nWe use galaxies in the volume-limited sample \n to compute the nearest neighbor densities\n and to make a fair comparison regardless of redshift.\nWe use neighbor galaxies with relative velocities $\\Delta v < 1500~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, \n and compute $\\Sigma_{5}$ relative to the center of each compact group. \nWe obtain $\\Sigma_{5}$ for 309 groups within the volume-limited sample.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=80mm]{fig14.eps}\n\\caption{\n(a) Cumulative distribution of the surrounding surface number density \n ($\\Sigma_{5}$) and (b) the distribution of $\\Sigma_{5}$ for\n our sample compact groups (solid line, open histogram) \n the Hickson compact groups (dashed line, hatched histogram),\n the DPOSS II compact groups (dotted line, filled histogram). } \n\\label{env}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{env} shows the $\\Sigma_{5}$ distribution for\n our sample compact groups along with the Hickson and the DPOSS II compact groups \n for the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.14$. \nSome groups in our study are \n in denser environment than the Hickson compact groups. \nIndeed, the A-D test rejects the hypothesis that \n the distributions of all three samples are extracted from the same parent population\n with a low p-value ($< 0.1$). \n\nFigure \\ref{env} suggests \n that the $\\Sigma_{5}$ distribution of compact groups\n can be divided into two\n as many previous studies suggested:\n `isolated' and `embedded' compact groups. \nTo examine the multiplicity of the $\\Sigma_{5}$ distribution,\n we use a statistical test, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM, \\citealp{Mur10}).\nThe GMM evaluates whether the data are more consistent\n with a multimodal Gaussian distribution \n rather than a unimodal Gaussian distribution.\nIf the data consist of multiple populations,\n the GMM returns\n 1) a low parametric bootstrap method probability,\n 2) a large separation ($D > 2$) between multiple Gaussian peaks,\n 3) a negative {\\it kurtosis} of the input distribution, and\n 4) a larger enhancement of the likelihood for the multimodal case than for the unimodal case ($-2 ~\\ln (L_{\\rm unimodal} / L_{\\rm multimodal})$).\n\nWe assume that there are two populations of compact groups\n with high and low $\\Sigma_{5}$, and apply the GMM.\nThe GMM test indicates that the $\\Sigma_{5}$ distribution\n may have a bimodal distribution with\n low probability $p = 6.97 \\times 10^{-6}$,\n {\\it kurtosis} $k = 0.186 \\pm 0.824$,\n large separation between peaks $D = 3.68 \\pm 0.53$, and\n large enhancement of the likelihood \n $-2 ~\\ln (L_{\\rm unimodal} / L_{\\rm multimodal}) = 29.3$.\nThis means that the $\\Sigma_{5}$ distribution is consistent with bimodal distribution.\nThe two populations of compact groups are divided at\n $\\log (\\Sigma_{5}) = 0.62$, and\n 91\\% (281 out of 309) of compact groups belong to a population with low $\\Sigma_{5}$.\nIf we accept this bimodal distribution of $\\Sigma_{5}$ and\n $\\Sigma_{5}$ traces  the local environments of compact groups,\n only $\\sim 9$\\% of compact groups are in dense environments.\nThis fraction is much lower than in previous studies ($33 - 50 \\%$),\n but our division is based on a statistical test that is very strict compared with \n other studies based on different local environment indicators \n (e.g. distance to nearby galaxy groups).\nHereafter, we refer the compact groups in dense environments as `embedded' groups,\n and the others as `isolated' groups.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=160mm]{fig15.eps}\n\\caption{The physical properties of embedded (hatched histograms) \n and isolated (open histograms) compact

}\n\\label{embsig}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFigure \\ref{embsig} shows the physical properties of\n the isolated and the embedded compact groups\n including group radius, velocity dispersion, crossing time, and number density.\nThe median size of embedded groups ($43.3 \\pm 4.0 ~h^{-1}$ kpc) is smaller\n than for isolated groups ($57.8 \\pm 1.4 ~h^{-1}$ kpc).\nThe discrepancy also exists even \n when we compare the $N\\ge4$ and $N=3$ compact groups separately.\nThis result is consistent with previous studies based on different compact group samples \\citep{Men11, Dia15}.\nThe smaller sizes of embedded groups\n result in lower number densities\n than for isolated groups (Figure \\ref{embsig} (d)).\nThe size and density distributions of the two groups are drawn from\n significantly different distributions\n as the A-D test suggests with low p-value $< 0.01$.\nThe median velocity dispersion of embedded groups ($316 \\pm 25~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$)\n is significantly larger than that of isolated groups ($219 \\pm 8~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$).\nThe distributions of velocity dispersions of the two groups are also different.\nThis is also consistent with the results in \\citet{Pom12}\n for the DPOSS II compact groups.\nTherefore,\n the median crossing time of embedded compact groups is\n shorter than the isolated compact groups.\nThe distributions of crossing time for the two groups\n are also significantly different (p-value from A-D test $<< 0.01$).\nWhen we divide the compact groups\n into isolated and embedded systems based on the distance\n to nearby galaxy clusters,\n the difference in physical properties between the two types remains.\n\nCompact groups based on Hickson's selection criteria,\n including our original catalog of \\citet{McC09},\n reflect a selection bias against dense local environments\n as a result of the isolation criterion.\nIn other words,\n embedded compact groups\n may not fully represent the compact group population in high-density regions\n because many compact groups are missed in or near high-density regions\n as a result of the isolation criterion. \nThe impact of this criterion is a function of the\n redshift of the group \\citep{Bar96}. \n\n\n\\section{SUMMARY}\n\nBy measuring new redshifts and incorporating redshifts from SDSS DR12 and other literature,\nwe construct a catalog of \n 192 $N \\geq 4$ compact groups with 799 member galaxies and\n 140 $N=3$ complete compact groups with 420 member galaxies at $0.01 < z < 0.21$. \nIn this catalog,\n all member galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts. \nTo date this catalog is the largest spectroscopically complete sample of these unusually dense systems. \nWe explore the physical properties of the groups in this catalog and compare them with previous samples. \n\nWe examine the redshift dependence of physical properties of compact groups\n in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.21$. \nThe velocity dispersion of compact groups changes little with redshift,\n indicating no significant evolution of dynamical masses of compact groups in this redshift range.\nThe space density of compact groups also shows \n no significant change with redshift. \nThus it appears \nthat either compact groups can survive longer than 1 Gyr or\n they continually reform by accreting new members from their surroundings. \n  \nThe early-type fraction in our sample compact groups is 62\\%,\n slightly exceeding the fraction in the Hickson compact groups. \nWe superimpose all of the compact groups in our sample to investigate\n the radial behavior of the velocity dispersion and morphological fraction.\nThe velocity dispersion of early- and late-type galaxies are similar \n in $N\\ge4$ compact groups, \n but the dispersion for the early-type galaxies is larger than \n for late-type galaxies in $N=3$ compact groups. \nThe velocity dispersions of early- and late-type galaxies in compact groups \n do not change much as a function of groupcentric radius. \nCompact groups enable examination of these issues at a galaxy density and \n spatial scale that are hard to access with any other systems.\n \nWe compare the catalog we construct with the Hickson and the DPOSS II samples\n that also have complete spectroscopy.\nWe compare sizes, number densities, velocity dispersions and environments \n as measured by the fifth nearest neighbor to the group. \nThe physical properties of our sample groups are \n similar to those for the Hickson compact groups, \n but they differ from those of the DPOSS II compact groups.\nThe differences result from differences in the selection criteria for the DPOSS II and\n the Hickson compact groups. \nThe parent catalog we use, \\citet{McC09}, is based on Hickson's criteria.\n\nThe local environments of compact groups are diverse. \nThe $\\Sigma_{5}$ distribution of compact groups is bimodal\n and 9\\% of compact groups are located in the denser region. \nThis `embedded' group fraction is lower than previous studies\n based on different local density tracers. \nThe embedded compact groups are smaller and have larger velocity dispersion\n than the isolated compact groups on average. \n\nCompact groups are a fascinating laboratory for studying galaxy evolution. \nExamination of the number density of these systems over a larger redshift range and \n comparison with simulations may further constrain \n the formation and evolution of these systems.\nIt is also important to clarify\n the subtle issues in the identification of the compact systems. \nFurther exploration of identification directly \n from complete spectroscopic surveys in the nearby and \n moderate redshift universe would provide a further foundation for understanding\n the nature of these systems.\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\nWe thank the
