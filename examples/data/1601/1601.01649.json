Here we present studies of fluctuations in facial electromyography (fEMG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) massive time series and changes of such signals in the course of emotional stimulation. Zygomaticus major (ZYG; ``smiling'' muscle) activity, corrugator supercilii (COR; ``frowning'' muscle) activity, and phasic skin conductance (PHSC; sweating) levels of $65$ participants were recorded during experiments that involved exposure to emotional stimuli (i.e., IAPS images, reading and writing messages on an artificial online discussion board). Temporal Taylor's  fluctuations scaling were found when signals for various participants and during various types of emotional events were compared. Values of scaling exponents were close to 1, suggesting an external origin and/or strong correlations of fluctuations in the system. Our statistical analysis shows that the scaling exponents enable discrimination between extreme valences and other values in ZYG and COR, as well as indicate the decreasing trend in arousal for these signals.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keyword} \nTaylor`s power law \\sep facial electromyography \\sep electrodermal activity \\sep IAPS \\sep emotions \\sep Big Data \n\n\\end{keyword}\n\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction} \nEasy access to massive amounts of high frequency data about humans -- their health~\\cite{ania_njp,klimek} and their responses (also remote)~\\cite{ania_physa, ania_plos,pohorecki,choloniewski} -- is an important fruit of the so-called {\\it Big data} science~\\cite{bigdata1,bigdata2,bigdata3}. In this scope psychophysiological information that can be transformed into undisputed facts/relations concerning our vitals organs~\\cite{urbanowicz} is of utmost importance. \n\nIn 1961, ecologist Lionel Roy Taylor  published his famous paper  \\cite{taylor} in which he reported a power law relationship between a  sample variance of density to the overall mean density of a sample of several organisms in a study area. The data was taken from observations of many  species, e.g., various kinds of larvae, worms, symphylas, macro-zooplankton, shellfish, etc.. Taylor was considering the scaling exponents as a universal {\\bf aggregation measure} of a given species. In his opinion, a strong  aggregation should correspond to a larger scaling exponent, and it should be a result of mutual attractions between individuals belonging to a given species. Mutual repulsion should result in lowering of spatial dispersion and in lowering of the scaling exponent.\n\nIn fact, Taylor rediscovered the law that had been found already in 1938 by a statistician H. Fairfield Smith who had described it in the (often forgotten) paper \\cite{smith} entitled  {\\it  An empirical law describing heterogeneity in the yields of agricultural crops}.  Smith   compared   yields of  wheat, maize, sorghum, mangolds and  potatoes   from different areas and found that {\\it the regression of the logarithms of the variances for plots of different areas on the logarithms of their areas was approximately linear} \\cite{smith}. Slopes of the regression curve (now we call them scaling exponents)  varied from crop to crop and even from one plant's region to another. However they were always smaller than a value received for  uncorrelated plants.  \n\nSmith connected a specific value of  regression slope   with crop heterogeneity.    He used the observation  to calculate the optimal area of the plot that should be taken  to get reliable information about given yields when real costs of labor needed to perform measurements are  taken into account.\n\n In general, Taylor's theorem leads to relating the standard deviation   of an additive variable with its mean value in similar systems as: $ \\sigma_i\\propto \\langle f_i\\rangle^\\alpha$\nwhere $\\sigma_i$ -- a standard deviation of a given additive value for $i$-th subsystem, $\\langle f_i\\rangle$ -- a mean of the value.\nIf the scaling exists then the value of the exponent $\\alpha$ allows to infer some properties of the analyzed system by comparing the results with a behavior of agent based models or stochastic  dynamics \\cite{kertesz,tadic2007transport,menezes2004B}. \n\nStudies of Smith and Taylor were devoted to observations of variance between samples of some yields, or number of some animals occupying different areas of the same surface. The proposed relationship was later confirmed in several other empirical studies in ecology (see for example Ref.~\\cite{kendal,marquet}), life sciences (e.g. scaling of cell numbers in representatives of a given species~\\cite{azevedo}), astrophysics~\\cite{uttley}, company  growth rates~\\cite{amaral} or stock market \\cite{kertesz}. For more examples and for theoretical models that try to explain the power law between the variance and the mean see, e.g.,  review papers  \\cite{kertesz,meng}.\n\nThe above mentioned empirical studies considered so-called    \\textit{ensemble fluctuations scaling} since variances were calculated over  an ensemble of samples (subsystems)  belonging to the same class (usually the class was labeled by a given surface of samples). There is also another kind of scaling called  \\textit{temporal fluctuations scaling} that, in ecological systems, relates the variability of populations  {\\bf time-series} to their mean \\cite{keitt2002}. This kind of scaling was also observed in many  natural and man made systems \\cite{kertesz}, including various kind of networks such as internet routers, river networks, highways networks or World Wide Web  \\cite{menezes2004A}. \n\nA natural question is whether the origin of the observed temporal fluctuations and the scaling law is an effect of a stochastic external driving force or the randomness of complex system internal dynamics \\cite{keitt2002,kertesz}.  In \\cite{menezes2004B}, it was suggested that one can separate both contributions and estimate the ratio of internal interactions between the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s components and the influence of external perturbations. Studies of temporal scaling  for fluctuations of traded values at NYSE and NASDAQ stock markets \\cite{eisler,kertesz} have shown that the scaling exponent strongly depends on the length of the time window where the variability was observed, and this dependence can provide information about the microscopic dynamics \\cite{keitt2002,kertesz}. Comparative investigations  of fluctuations scaling of quotation activity at FOREX are presented in \\cite{Aki1} and \\cite{Aki2}.  Theoretical studies aimed to build agent based models explaining the temporal scaling can be found  e.g.  in \\cite{tadic2007transport} or \\cite{duch}, where various kinds of network topology and random walks were considered.  \n\nThe main focus of this paper is to study high frequency fluctuations in facial electromyography (fEMG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) time series in the course of various emotional stimulation episodes. Our goal is to  check if biological subsystems sensitive to human emotions, i.e.  facial muscles, and skin sweat glands follow the temporal Taylor's scaling. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of such a scaling was never reported for psychophysiological signals. The challenge will be to distinguish various human emotions using observations of the above type of fluctuations.  \n\n\\section{Description of temporal Taylor's fluctuation scaling}\nIn the present paper, we will consider temporal Taylor's scaling \\cite{kertesz,tadic2007transport,menezes2004B,keitt2002,menezes2004A,duch}. \nLet $f_{i,t}$ be a positive variable $f_{i,t}$ describing some activity of the object $i$ at time moment $t$.  Examples of such activities can be a number of data packages coming to a router, or a number of visits of a web page or a muscle activity.  Let the total number of elements  in time series of this activity be $T$, i.e $t=1,2,3, \\dots, T$ (further  we will assume that $T$ is the same for all objects $i$). Let us divide the series into $Q$ windows of size $\\Delta$, i.e., $Q \\Delta =T$. \nThe quantity $[f_i^{(q,\\Delta)}]$ stands for a cumulative value of the variable $f_i$ in a window of the size $\\Delta$ and $(\\sigma_i^{(\\Delta)})^2$ is a variance of this cumulative variable in the whole data series. \nThen we have \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n(\\sigma_i^{(\\Delta)})^2=

on dynamics of constituents forming a considered system. The case $\\alpha(\\Delta)=1/2$ corresponds to a situation when for example  the system consists of {\\it mutually  independent elements} as in the case of the ideal gas or for random  processes obeying the  Central Limit Theorem. This value can also be observed when the variable $f_i$ corresponds to a number of some events  (e.g., data packages coming to a given node $i$)  and   when  the time window $\\Delta$ is so short that it is very unlikely that more than two events can emerge in a single window \\cite{kertesz}. Larger values of the exponent  $\\alpha(\\Delta)$ can correspond to a larger  degree of synchronization of elements forming the system and  a set of completely synchronized elements displays scaling   $\\alpha(\\Delta)=1$. A similar situation takes place when the system is driven by an external force.   \n\nObservations  of Taylor's scaling should not be confused with  \\textit{Detrended Fluctuation Analysis} (DFA)  \\cite{dfa}  and other approaches~\\cite{eke2000,eke2002} used to quantify long-range power-law correlations in various signals~\\cite{ckpeng} including psychophysiological data related to emotional states  \\cite{DFA6,DFA8,DFA9,dfa_emocje1,dfa_emocje2}.\n  Let us stress then while the DFA framework uses a single time series the Taylor's scaling approach compares properties of a set of different objects that can be even independent one from another. It follows that the exponent $\\alpha$  of DFA scaling and the exponent  $\\alpha(\\Delta)$ of Taylor's scaling defined in Eq. (\\ref{Taylor}) are not the same although there exists a relation between derivatives of both exponents, see Ref.  \\cite{kertesz}.\n\n\\section{Data}\nOur data were gathered during an experiment conducted at Jacobs University Bremen, Germany. There were 65 participants (30 female; \\textit{M}age = 20.4 years; \\textit{SD} = 1.9) that were subjected to emotional stimuli -- pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) \\cite{lang} and forums (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:eksperyment} for schematic representation of the experiment). During the course of the experiment, participants' fEMG (corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major) and EDA (left and right foot skin conductance) were recorded with the sampling frequency $\\nu_s = 2\\mathrm{kHz}$. Additionally,  markers were placed in the time series to allow identification of an event taking place at a given time. The total volume of the considered dataset was around  $25$ GB. \n\nEmotions elicited during IAPS image presentations were scored by the participants in questionnaires with three questions asking separately about experienced \\textit{positive}, \\textit{negative} emotion and \\textit{arousal} on Likert-type scales from 1 to 7. Two-dimensional models of two orthogonal bipolar dimensions have been a traditional structure in dimensional models of emotion \\cite{Russell1980,Russell2009,Yik2011}. Among these two-dimensional models, {\\it valence} and {\\it arousal} ($1\\leq a\\leq 7$) have been used very frequently ~\\cite{mauss}, although variants have, e.g., suggested additional (sub-)dimensions for arousal/activation \\cite{Thayer1989} or valence \\cite{Watson1985}. Valence reflects the emotional sign (pleasure vs. displeasure) whereas arousal indicates a state of activation (activation vs. deactivation). Coordinates in the resulting valence and arousal space can can further be projected back, with some limitations, onto higher-dimensional discrete emotions models \\cite{Russell1980}, e.g., fear (negative and aroused), sad (negative and not aroused) etc.. However, the use of a dimensional {\\it Core Affect} structure as such does not require this translation, and has been argued to complement rather than compete with categorical structures \\cite{Yik2011}. In this study, responses to the positive and negative emotion subscales were merged and transformed into one value for \\textit{valence} ($v=4+\\lfloor(positive-negative)/2\\rfloor$; $1\\leq v\\leq 7$). There were 19 IAPS images shown to each participant. Each presentation lasted for 6 seconds and was preceded by 2 seconds of baseline and followed by an emotional questionnaire. The whole experiment (involving forum activities) usually took about 30--40 minutes.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{ryn1ab.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Graphic representation} of the sequence of the main experimental blocs of the study. The arrows indicate randomizations of blocks between participants. }\n\\label{fig:eksperyment}\n\\end{figure}\n\nMain analyses were carried out using MATLAB\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}\\cite{matlab}, the data were stored in a PostgreSQL database. The statistical analysis of exponent comparison was performed using \\textsf{R} language \\cite{R}.\n\n\\section{Signals characteristics}\n\n\\subsection{Facial electromyography}\n\\par Facial electromyography (fEMG) is a well established method for the measurement of facial activity, including facial muscle activity associated with emotional valence \\cite{tassinary}. In the present study, this measurement focused on activation over two sites of facial muscles. \\textit{Corrugator supercilii} (COR) muscle activity is exhibited when frowning and shows a linear effect of less activity in response toward pleasant stimuli; activity at the \\textit{zygomaticus major} (ZYG) muscle site is associated with smiling, and a quadratic effect of valence \\cite{larsen}. One cannot exactly map the activity of the muscles with corresponding emotions or even facial expressions, because of the variety of uses of these muscles (e.g., during speech), as well as their role in social interactions including, e.g., polite smiling that does not express an intense internal emotional state as such. However, in the conditions of controlled laboratory experiments such as the present research, occasional facial activity unrelated to emotions can be regarded as error variance across comparable conditions of emotional stimulation.\n\\par All analyses were performed using raw signals because any smoothing or filtering would cause a loss of information about signal fluctuations.\n\\par The COR and ZYG signals are somewhat similar due to their origin, namely muscle activity. They differ in that COR is bilaterally innervated as opposed to a greater contralateral innervation of ZYG \\cite{Rinn}.\n\n\\subsection{Electrodermal activity}\n\\par Electrodermal activity (EDA), or skin conductance (SC) analyses are based on Galvanic skin responses, i.e., changes in the electrical conductivity of the skin that are most typically recorded at the subject's hands (palmar) or feet (plantar) \\cite{boucsein}. These changes are the result of the opening and closing of sweat glands in the skin that produce sweating\\cite{alex}, which in turn is related to arousal. These changes in phasic EDA can be caused by experiencing an emotion (such as being exposed to various visual stimuli) \\cite{bach2}. More specifically, both \\textit{tonic} changes in \\textit{skin conductance level} (SCL) as well as \\textit{phasic} \\textit{skin conductance responses} (SCRs) have frequently been used in the literature as indicators of sympathetic emotional arousal \\cite{boucsein}. The \\textit{tonic} part of the signal reflects a slowly changing global trend that is not directly in response to short-term visual stimulation, and therefore was not used for the present fluctuation-dissipation analyses. The \\textit{phasic} part is a so-called rapid changing factor. SCRs are a type of phasic response that are widely used in scoring event-related arousal exhibited by experimental subjects. SCRs are typically defined within the psychophysiological literature \\cite{dawson} as requiring a certain minimum amplitude change such as 0.01-0.05 $\\mu$S. In addition, \\textit{event-related SCRs} must occur either within a specific time window (e.g., 1-4 s latency) in order to qualify as likely related to an external event, whereas non-specific SCRs (NS-SCRs) can occur at any time during the recording. SCRs will subsequently be referred to simply as \\textit{phasic SC} (PHSC).\n\n\\par The present research involved a bilateral plantar recording of EDA, i.e., from the subjects' feet. As opposed to so-called non-palmar non-plantar sites \\cite{boucsein}, an adequate recording at this site is non-controversial since it has been shown to exhibit good measurement properties and is to be preferred over recordings from, e.g., the wrist, which is more affected by thermoregulation \\cite{boucsein}. Palmar recording sites (i.e., at the palms or fingers) are even more typical for laboratory measurements of EDA. However, in the present study, participants had to type on a keyboard during the experiment. This would have resulted in substantial movement artifacts for a palmar measure. The plantar recording sites greatly minimized this issue, and further allowed a bilateral recording, allowing a validation of the recording quality in the event of any remaining movement artefacts. However, no significant intraindividual differences were observed between left and right foot EDA. Unless stated otherwise, the right foot SCL signal was analyzed.\n\n\\section{Results}\nFacial electromyography of COR and ZYG describes   activity of corresponding muscles that  are results of an aggregated activity of single muscle fibers.  Similarly, electrodermal activity describes the phenomenon  of skin conductance that  is an aggregated  effect resulting from sweat glands. Since  each participant is an instance of a human being which took part in an experiment (similar ``systems'' in the species), one can consider a \\textit{temporal fluctuation scaling (TFS)} in the analyzed physiological signals collected  in the course of the whole experiment, and during \n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:tfs-all},  the horizontal axes describe  mean values and  vertical axes describe standard deviations of a given signal gathered during the whole experiment consisting of series of episodes of emotional simulations via the IAPS images. Although the systems are highly non-stationary,  we could observe  Taylor's scaling. Obtained exponents $\\alpha_{COR}=0.89 \\pm 0.05$, $\\alpha_{ZYG}=1.03 \\pm 0.09$ and $\\alpha_{PHSC}=0.86 \\pm 0.07$ are similar and suggest a major influence of external factors to dynamics (i.e., synchronization of elements which contribute to the value of a signal). When considering a time series for the whole experiment, one has to realize that the system (participant) is surely out of an equilibrium, experiencing different kinds and magnitudes of a stimulation. It follows that the measured variances  originate not only from  fast fluctuations of muscle activity or skin conductance but also from passing through  several  emotional states.   \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Signal} & \\textbf{Scaling exponents $\\alpha$} \\\\ \\hline\nCOR & $0.89\\pm 0.05$ ($R^2=0.83$)\\\\\nZYG & $1.03\\pm 0.09$ ($R^2=0.68$)\\\\ \nPHSC & $0.83\\pm 0.06$ ($R^2=0.86$)\\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{\\it Exponents obtained for temporal fluctuation scaling in the whole series of various signals (plots -- see Figure~\\ref{fig:tfs-all}); errors calculated as $\\sigma$ from a least squares method.}  \n\\label{tab_tfs}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-all-cor.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it COR}\n\\label{fig:tfs_cor}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-all-zyg.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it ZYG}\n\\label{fig:tfs_zyg}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-all-phsc.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it PHSC}\n\\label{fig:tfs_phsc}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Temporal fluctuation scaling} for \\textbf{the whole signals} with $\\Delta = 1/\\nu_s=0.0005\\mathrm{s}$.

Intermediate colors correspond to intermediate levels of arousal. The black line describes a series consisting of all IAPS pictures. Points in all figures are logarithmic binned data, while the insets present values of scaling exponents alpha $\\alpha$ for given scores.\n\nFor ZYG we always have $\\alpha > 1$. We see also that for extreme values of emotional valencies $v=1$, $v=6$ and $v=7$, the exponent $\\alpha$ reaches its lowest values (Fig.~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-zyg-val}) that seem different than those for other scores. Additionally in Fig.~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-zyg-aro} highly aroused states ($a=7$) can be identified. In COR, most scores show $\\alpha\\approx1$ but seem to drop to $\\alpha\\approx 0.85$ for very positive ($v=7$, Fig~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-cor-val}) and very aroused states ($a=6$, $a=7$, Fig~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-cor-aro}). PHSC results (Figs.~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-phsc-val} and~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-phsc-aro}) are very noisy and no clear trends are visible but $0.5<\\alpha<1$ in all cases.

The case $\\alpha(\\Delta)=1/2$ corresponds to a situation when for example  the system consists of {\\it mutually  independent elements} as in the case of the ideal gas or for random  processes obeying the  Central Limit Theorem. This value can also be observed when the variable $f_i$ corresponds to a number of some events  (e.g., data packages coming to a given node $i$)  and   when  the time window $\\Delta$ is so short that it is very unlikely that more than two events can emerge in a single window \\cite{kertesz}. Larger values of the exponent  $\\alpha(\\Delta)$ can correspond to a larger  degree of synchronization of elements forming the system and  a set of completely synchronized elements displays scaling   $\\alpha(\\Delta)=1$. A similar situation takes place when the system is driven by an external force.   \n\nObservations  of Taylor's scaling should not be confused with  \\textit{Detrended Fluctuation Analysis} (DFA)  \\cite{dfa}  and other approaches~\\cite{eke2000,eke2002} used to quantify long-range power-law correlations in various signals~\\cite{ckpeng} including psychophysiological data related to emotional states  \\cite{DFA6,DFA8,DFA9,dfa_emocje1,dfa_emocje2}.\n  Let us stress then while the DFA framework uses a single time series the Taylor's scaling approach compares properties of a set of different objects that can be even independent one from another. It follows that the exponent $\\alpha$  of DFA scaling and the exponent  $\\alpha(\\Delta)$ of Taylor's scaling defined in Eq. (\\ref{Taylor}) are not the same although there exists a relation between derivatives of both exponents, see Ref.  \\cite{kertesz}.\n\n\\section{Data}\nOur data were gathered during an experiment conducted at Jacobs University Bremen, Germany. There were 65 participants (30 female; \\textit{M}age = 20.4 years; \\textit{SD} = 1.9) that were subjected to emotional stimuli -- pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) \\cite{lang} and forums (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:eksperyment} for schematic representation of the experiment). During the course of the experiment, participants' fEMG (corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major) and EDA (left and right foot skin conductance) were recorded with the sampling frequency $\\nu_s = 2\\mathrm{kHz}$. Additionally,  markers were placed in the time series to allow identification of an event taking place at a given time. The total volume of the considered dataset was around  $25$ GB. \n\nEmotions elicited during IAPS image presentations were scored by the participants in questionnaires with three questions asking separately about experienced \\textit{positive}, \\textit{negative} emotion and \\textit{arousal} on Likert-type scales from 1 to 7. Two-dimensional models of two orthogonal bipolar dimensions have been a traditional structure in dimensional models of emotion \\cite{Russell1980,Russell2009,Yik2011}. Among these two-dimensional models, {\\it valence} and {\\it arousal} ($1\\leq a\\leq 7$) have been used very frequently ~\\cite{mauss}, although variants have, e.g., suggested additional (sub-)dimensions for arousal/activation \\cite{Thayer1989} or valence \\cite{Watson1985}. Valence reflects the emotional sign (pleasure vs. displeasure) whereas arousal indicates a state of activation (activation vs. deactivation). Coordinates in the resulting valence and arousal space can can further be projected back, with some limitations, onto higher-dimensional discrete emotions models \\cite{Russell1980}, e.g., fear (negative and aroused), sad (negative and not aroused) etc.. However, the use of a dimensional {\\it Core Affect} structure as such does not require this translation, and has been argued to complement rather than compete with categorical structures \\cite{Yik2011}. In this study, responses to the positive and negative emotion subscales were merged and transformed into one value for \\textit{valence} ($v=4+\\lfloor(positive-negative)/2\\rfloor$; $1\\leq v\\leq 7$). There were 19 IAPS images shown to each participant. Each presentation lasted for 6 seconds and was preceded by 2 seconds of baseline and followed by an emotional questionnaire. The whole experiment (involving forum activities) usually took about 30--40 minutes.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{ryn1ab.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Graphic representation} of the sequence of the main experimental blocs of the study. The arrows indicate randomizations of blocks between participants. }\n\\label{fig:eksperyment}\n\\end{figure}\n\nMain analyses were carried out using MATLAB\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}\\cite{matlab}, the data were stored in a PostgreSQL database. The statistical analysis of exponent comparison was performed using \\textsf{R} language \\cite{R}.\n\n\\section{Signals characteristics}\n\n\\subsection{Facial electromyography}\n\\par Facial electromyography (fEMG) is a well established method for the measurement of facial activity, including facial muscle activity associated with emotional valence \\cite{tassinary}. In the present study, this measurement focused on activation over two sites of facial muscles. \\textit{Corrugator supercilii} (COR) muscle activity is exhibited when frowning and shows a linear effect of less activity in response toward pleasant stimuli; activity at the \\textit{zygomaticus major} (ZYG) muscle site is associated with smiling, and a quadratic effect of valence \\cite{larsen}. One cannot exactly map the activity of the muscles with corresponding emotions or even facial expressions, because of the variety of uses of these muscles (e.g., during speech), as well as their role in social interactions including, e.g., polite smiling that does not express an intense internal emotional state as such. However, in the conditions of controlled laboratory experiments such as the present research, occasional facial activity unrelated to emotions can be regarded as error variance across comparable conditions of emotional stimulation.\n\\par All analyses were performed using raw signals because any smoothing or filtering would cause a loss of information about signal fluctuations.\n\\par The COR and ZYG signals are somewhat similar due to their origin, namely muscle activity. They differ in that COR is bilaterally innervated as opposed to a greater contralateral innervation of ZYG \\cite{Rinn}.\n\n\\subsection{Electrodermal activity}\n\\par Electrodermal activity (EDA), or skin conductance (SC) analyses are based on Galvanic skin responses, i.e., changes in the electrical conductivity of the skin that are most typically recorded at the subject's hands (palmar) or feet (plantar) \\cite{boucsein}. These changes are the result of the opening and closing of sweat glands in the skin that produce sweating\\cite{alex}, which in turn is related to arousal. These changes in phasic EDA can be caused by experiencing an emotion (such as being exposed to various visual stimuli) \\cite{bach2}. More specifically, both \\textit{tonic} changes in \\textit{skin conductance level} (SCL) as well as \\textit{phasic} \\textit{skin conductance responses} (SCRs) have frequently been used in the literature as indicators of sympathetic emotional arousal \\cite{boucsein}. The \\textit{tonic} part of the signal reflects a slowly changing global trend that is not directly in response to short-term visual stimulation, and therefore was not used for the present fluctuation-dissipation analyses. The \\textit{phasic} part is a so-called rapid changing factor. SCRs are a type of phasic response that are widely used in scoring event-related arousal exhibited by experimental subjects. SCRs are typically defined within the psychophysiological literature \\cite{dawson} as requiring a certain minimum amplitude change such as 0.01-0.05 $\\mu$S. In addition, \\textit{event-related SCRs} must occur either within a specific time window (e.g., 1-4 s latency) in order to qualify as likely related to an external event, whereas non-specific SCRs (NS-SCRs) can occur at any time during the recording. SCRs will subsequently be referred to simply as \\textit{phasic SC} (PHSC).\n\n\\par The present research involved a bilateral plantar recording of EDA, i.e., from the subjects' feet. As opposed to so-called non-palmar non-plantar sites \\cite{boucsein}, an adequate recording at this site is non-controversial since it has been shown to exhibit good measurement properties and is to be preferred over recordings from, e.g., the wrist, which is more affected by thermoregulation \\cite{boucsein}. Palmar recording sites (i.e., at the palms or fingers) are even more typical for laboratory measurements of EDA. However, in the present study, participants had to type on a keyboard during the experiment. This would have resulted in substantial movement artifacts for a palmar measure. The plantar recording sites greatly minimized this issue, and further allowed a bilateral recording, allowing a validation of the recording quality in the event of any remaining movement artefacts. However, no significant intraindividual differences were observed between left and right foot EDA. Unless stated otherwise, the right foot SCL signal was analyzed.\n\n\\section{Results}\nFacial electromyography of COR and ZYG describes   activity of corresponding muscles that  are results of an aggregated activity of single muscle fibers.  Similarly, electrodermal activity describes the phenomenon  of skin conductance that  is an aggregated  effect resulting from sweat glands. Since  each participant is an instance of a human being which took part in an experiment (similar ``systems'' in the species), one can consider a \\textit{temporal fluctuation scaling (TFS)} in the analyzed physiological signals collected  in the course of the whole experiment, and during \n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:tfs-all},  the horizontal axes describe  mean values and  vertical axes describe standard deviations of a given signal gathered during the whole experiment consisting of series of episodes of emotional simulations via the IAPS images. Although the systems are highly non-stationary,  we could observe  Taylor's scaling. Obtained exponents $\\alpha_{COR}=0.89 \\pm 0.05$, $\\alpha_{ZYG}=1.03 \\pm 0.09$ and $\\alpha_{PHSC}=0.86 \\pm 0.07$ are similar and suggest a major influence of external factors to dynamics (i.e., synchronization of elements which contribute to the value of a signal). When considering a time series for the whole experiment, one has to realize that the system (participant) is surely out of an equilibrium, experiencing different kinds and magnitudes of a stimulation. It follows that the measured variances  originate not only from  fast fluctuations of muscle activity or skin conductance but also from passing through  several  emotional states.   \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Signal} & \\textbf{Scaling exponents $\\alpha$} \\\\ \\hline\nCOR & $0.89\\pm 0.05$ ($R^2=0.83$)\\\\\nZYG & $1.03\\pm 0.09$ ($R^2=0.68$)\\\\ \nPHSC & $0.83\\pm 0.06$ ($R^2=0.86$)\\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{\\it Exponents obtained for temporal fluctuation scaling in the whole series of various signals (plots -- see Figure~\\ref{fig:tfs-all}); errors calculated as $\\sigma$ from a least squares method.}  \n\\label{tab_tfs}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-all-cor.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it COR}\n\\label{fig:tfs_cor}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-all-zyg.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it ZYG}\n\\label{fig:tfs_zyg}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.32\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-all-phsc.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it PHSC}\n\\label{fig:tfs_phsc}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Temporal fluctuation scaling} for \\textbf{the whole signals} with $\\Delta = 1/\\nu_s=0.0005\\mathrm{s}$.

In the Figs.~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-zyg-aro},~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-cor-aro} and ~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-phsc-aro}, the light green line corresponds to the arousal of the subject $a=1$, i.e., a very calm state and the dark red line describes the case of $a=7$, i.e., a very aroused state.

Points in all figures are logarithmic binned data, while the insets present values of scaling exponents alpha $\\alpha$ for given scores.\n\nFor ZYG we always have $\\alpha > 1$.

The values $t$ and $m$ for each pair of valence---valence or arousal---arousal are then used with Student's distribution to test the null hypothesis that the exponents are equal. Taking into account the fact that for each dataset we have 21 pairs to compare we decided to use step-wise algorithm of Holm-Bonferroni method \\cite{holm} to adjust the originally obtained p-values.\n\nThe exponents' comparison is shown in Tables \\ref{stat:zyg}-\\ref{stat:phsc}, where we use significance codes to express p-values that allow for an instant inspection of the differences among the results. Statistical analyses back up our previous conclusions. Indeed, in the case of valence in ZYG (see Table \\ref{stat:zyg}-left), the extreme cases ($v=1$, 6 and 7) are different from the rest ($v = 2$, 3, 4), which in turn are either indistinguishable (e.g, 2 and 3 or 4 and 5) or only slightly diverse (e.g., 2 and 3 or 2 and 5). On the other hand, $v=1$ and $v=6$ are not significantly different which might suggest a parabola-like relation between exponent $\\alpha$ and valence. In a similar way in the case of arousal in ZYG  (see Table \\ref{stat:zyg}-right), the group $a=1,3,4$ is indistinguishable, so is $a=5,6$ while $a=7$ is significantly (with $p < 0.001$ in all cases) different from all other exponents. This type of setting gives a reasonable point to infer a decreasing relation between $\\alpha$ and arousal. For valence in COR (Table \\ref{stat:cor}-left), the situation is even more obvious --- only $v=7$ is significantly different in this set, other points seem to form a stable level (with the single exception between $v=4$ and $v=5$). The case of arousal in COR (Table \\ref{stat:cor}-right) resembles the same variable in ZYG: once again there is a clear distinction for low and high arousal states. Finally, the PHSC signal is the most difficult one for interpretation: the analysis of valence in Table \\ref{stat:phsc} gives clear evidence that only $v=2$ is a strictly outlying point. Similarly, only $a=6$ in PHSC arousal table is different for all others. The analysis in this case is inconclusive as to the detection of a clear relation between the variables in question.  \n\n\\begin{samepage}\n\\begin{figure}[p]\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-iaps-zyg-val.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it ZYG (valence)}\n\\label{fig:tfs-iaps-zyg-val}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{tfs-iaps-zyg-aro.pdf}\n\\caption{\\it ZYG (arousal)}\n\\label{fig:tfs-iaps-zyg-aro}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{Results of temporal fluctuation measured for \\textbf{ZYG} by standard deviations as functions of mean values of this signal during \\textbf{IAPS stimulation}.

This effect can be induced by the external influence and/or internal coupling between these elements. The phenomenon is mostly seen for ZYG signal data since the corresponding scaling exponent is  $\\alpha_{ZYG} \\approx 1$, while $\\alpha_{COR} \\approx 0.9$ and $\\alpha_{PHSC} \\approx 0.85$. \n   \nSecondly, when the results of Taylor's scaling are considered separately for different values of valence or arousal connected to IAPS stimulation, new features emerge (Figs.~\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-zyg}--\\ref{fig:tfs-iaps-phsc}). Using statistical analysis (Tables \\ref{stat:zyg}--\\ref{stat:phsc}), we clearly indicated that extreme valences (highly positive and negative in the case of ZYG signal and only highly positive for COR signal) stand out from the ``bulk''  --- the values of $\\alpha$ connected to such emotions are clearly distinguishable from the remaining part. As it concerns arousal for smiling and frowning muscles, similar analyses suggest a decreasing relation between the exponent $\\alpha$ and the level excitation. Although it is possible to see significant differences in PHSC results, they are more noisy and do not show any apparent trends.\n   \nFinally when Taylor's scaling analysis is performed for different time windows $\\Delta$ (see Figures~\\ref{fig:alfa-zyg}--\\ref{fig:alfa-phsc}) then corresponding scaling exponents are changing.  This is mostly seen for scaling of COR signals when highly positive stimulations take place  ($v=7$). In such a case the scaling exponent can be around $\\alpha=0.5$ thus synchronization disappears for this signal in a longer time scale. \n \nTo our knowledge it is the first study where the temporal Taylor's fluctuations scaling has been observed in signals of human emotional systems.  While in the present paper we have not strictly compared the quality of our method with traditional means of emotion science and psychophysiology used for emotional response data from fEMG and EDA, our approach might contribute to the development of new means of analyses that are better able to distinguish external vs. internal sources of the response via fluctuations scaling \\cite{menezes2004B}.\nIn future research, we plan  to use  various detrending algorithms to remove possible effects of data  nonstationarity as well to combine the Taylor's studies with the Hurst exponent analysis \\cite{kertesz}. \n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments} \nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 231323 (\\textit{Collective Emotions in Cyberspace} project -- CyberEMOTIONS).
