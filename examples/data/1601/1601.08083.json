Whilst this multiplicity permits observationally determining\nthe minimum masses of the stars through their orbital motion, it also\nleads to complications. For instance, the binarity of massive stars\ncan result in interactions between their stellar winds that produce\nobservational signatures throughout the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g.\nRauw \\cite{Leuven}). Moreover, during the lifetime of a massive binary,\nthe binarity influences the evolution of the stars in various ways\n(e.g. Langer \\cite{Langer1}). These evolutionary effects range from\ntidally induced rotational mixing (e.g.\\ de Mink et al.\\ \\cite{deMink})\nover exchange of matter and angular momentum through a Roche lobe\noverflow (RLOF) interaction (e.g.\\ Podsiadlowski et al.\\ \\cite{Podsiadlowski},\nde Loore \\& Vanbeveren \\cite{dLV}, Wellstein et al.\\ \\cite{Wellstein},\nHurley et al.\\ \\cite{Hurley}) to the merging of both stars (e.g.\\ Podsiadlowski\net al.\\ \\cite{Podsiadlowski}, Wellstein et al.\\ \\cite{Wellstein}).\nIn RLOF interactions, three different situations are distinguished:\ncase A, for which the RLOF episode occurs when the mass-donor is on\nthe core-hydrogen burning main-sequence; case B, when the star is\nin the hydrogen-shell burning phase; and case C, for which the star\nis in the helium-shell burning phase (Kippenhahn \\& Weigert \\cite{KW},\nVanbeveren et al.\\ \\cite{VDLVR}). These binary interactions significantly\naffect the physical properties of the components and their subsequent\nevolution. Despite considerable progresses in theoretical models,\nthere remain a number of open questions such as the actual efficiency\nof accretion (e.g.\\ Wellstein et al.\\ \\cite{Wellstein}, de Mink\net al.\\ \\cite{deMink1}, Dray \\& Tout \\cite{DT}). To better understand\nthis phenomenon, we need in-depth studies of systems undergoing or\nhaving undergone mass exchange.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nIn this context, HD~149\\,404 is an interesting target. It is a detached,\nnon-eclipsing O-star binary, member of the Ara OB1 association, located\nat a distance of 1.3\\,$\\pm$ 0.1 kpc (Herbst \\& Havlen \\cite{Herbst}).\nThe orbital parameters were revised by Rauw et al. (\\cite{Rauw}).\nThese authors found an orbital period of 9.81 days and a circular\norbit. They also estimated an orbital inclination of 21\\textdegree{}\nby comparing ``typical'' masses of supergiants with similar spectral\ntypes to those of both components. \nThe spectrum of HD~149\\,404 displays variable emission lines (He\n\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4686, H$\\alpha$) that are likely indicative\nof a wind-wind interaction (Rauw et al.\\ \\cite{Rauw}, Thaller et\nal.\\ \\cite{Thaller}, Naz\u00e9 et al.\\ \\cite{Naze}). One of its components\nwas assigned an ON spectral type, which suggests a significant nitrogen\nenrichment of its atmosphere. \n\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nIn this study, we determine the fundamental parameters of the stars\nof this system through several analysis techniques. The data used\nin our study are presented in Sect.\\ \\ref{data}. In Sect.\\,\\ref{Prelim}\nwe present the preparatory treatment of our data, which included disentangling\nthe spectra of the binary system to reconstruct individual spectra\nof the binary components, which are needed for the subsequent spectral\nanalysis. The spectral analyses were made with the non-LTE model atmosphere\ncode CMFGEN and are presented in Sect.\\,\\ref{Modelatmosphere}. In\nSect.\\,\\ref{Conclusions} we discuss the evolutionary state of HD~149\\,404\nand compare it with similar systems.\n\n\n\\section{Observational data \\textmd{\\label{data}}}\n\nThe optical spectra analysed here are the \u00e9chelle spectra used by\nRauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}) in their study of the orbital solution\nand wind interactions of HD~149\\,404. These data were collected\nin May 1999 and February 2000 with the FEROS and Coralie spectrographs\nmounted on the ESO 1.5\\,m telescope and 1.2\\,m Euler Swiss telescope\nat La Silla, respectively. The FEROS and Coralie spectrographs have\nresolving powers of 48\\,000 and 50\\,000 and cover the wavelength\nranges 3650 -- 9200\\,\\AA{}\\ and 3875 -- 6800\\,\\AA{}, respectively.\nFurther details on the instrumentation and the data reduction are\ngiven by Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}). Because of some problems with\nthe extraction of the FEROS data of May 2000, the normalization of\nthe latter was more uncertain, and we therefore excluded these data\nfrom the disentengling procedure, and thus from the further analysis.\n\nTo complement our optical data, we also retrieved 25 short-wavelength,\nhigh-resolution (SWP) \\textit{IUE} spectra of HD~149\\,404 from the\n\\textit{IUE} archives. These spectra were previously described by\nStickland \\& Koch (\\cite{Stickland}).\n\nTable\\,\\ref{journal} yields the journal of observations along with\nthe orbital phases computed according to the ephemerides of Rauw et\nal.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}, their He \\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4471 orbital\nsolution). The optical spectra provide a good sampling of the orbital\ncycle, which is important for the disentangling in Sect.\\,\\ref{Prelim}.\n\n\\begin{table}[htb]\n\\caption{Journal of the optical (top) and UV (bottom) spectra\\label{journal}}\n\n\n\\begin{centering}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{3}{c}{Optical spectroscopy}\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \nHJD-2\\,450\\,000  & Inst.  & $\\phi$ \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n1299.796  & FEROS  & 0.24 \\tabularnewline\n1300.788  & FEROS  & 0.34 \\tabularnewline\n1301.792  & FEROS  & 0.45 \\tabularnewline\n1302.783  & FEROS  & 0.55 \\tabularnewline\n1304.792  & FEROS  & 0.75 \\tabularnewline\n1578.866  & Coralie  & 0.68 \\tabularnewline\n1579.879  & Coralie  & 0.78 \\tabularnewline\n1580.872  & Coralie  & 0.88 \\tabularnewline\n1581.864  & Coralie  & 0.98 \\tabularnewline\n1582.869  & Coralie  & 0.09 \\tabularnewline\n1583.877  & Coralie  & 0.19 \\tabularnewline\n1584.857  & Coralie  & 0.29 \\tabularnewline\n1585.845  & Coralie  & 0.39 \\tabularnewline\n1586.870  & Coralie  & 0.49 \\tabularnewline\n1587.861  & Coralie  & 0.59 \\tabularnewline\n1588.886  & Coralie  & 0.70 \\tabularnewline\n1590.886  & Coralie  & 0.90 \\tabularnewline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\centering{}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textit{IUE} SWP spectroscopy}\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \nJD-2\\,440\\,000  & $\\phi$  & JD-2\\,440\\,000  & $\\phi$ \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n3718.044  & 0.76  & 4450.176  & 0.35 \\tabularnewline\n3724.588  & 0.42  & 4460.090  & 0.36 \\tabularnewline\n3776.869  & 0.75  & 9564.333  & 0.42 \\tabularnewline\n3776.921  & 0.76  & 9565.329  & 0.52 \\tabularnewline\n3776.966  & 0.76  & 9817.595  & 0.23 \\tabularnewline\n3793.028  & 0.40  & 9818.630  & 0.33 \\tabularnewline\n3798.965  & 0.00  & 9840.402  & 0.55 \\tabularnewline\n3926.010  & 0.95  & 9910.425  & 0.68 \\tabularnewline\n4001.156  & 0.60  & 9911.396  & 0.78 \\tabularnewline\n4001.203  & 0.61  & 9912.400  & 0.88 \\tabularnewline\n4120.089  & 0.72  & 9913.396  & 0.99 \\tabularnewline\n4129.216  & 0.65  & 9915.391  & 0.19 \\tabularnewline\n4412.327  & 0.50  &  & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\\section{Preparatory analysis \\textmd{\\label{Prelim}}}\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral disentangling}\n\nThe previous determination of the orbital solution of the system performed\nby Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}) allowed us to recover the individual\nspectra of both components by separating the normalized spectra of\nthe binary system. For this purpose, we used our disentangling routine\n(Rauw \\cite{DSc}), which is based on the method of Gonz\u00e1lez \\& Levato\n(\\cite{GL}) and was previously used by Linder et al.\\ (\\cite{Linder})\nand improved by Mahy et al. (\\cite{Mahy}). The basic idea behind\nthis technique is that the most natural way to handle spectra for\nradial velocity measurements is to express them as a function of $x=\\ln{\\lambda}$\ninstead of as a function of $\\lambda$. In this way, the Doppler shift\nfor a line of rest wavelength $\\lambda_{0}$ can be expressed as \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\ln{\\lambda} & = & \\ln{\\left[\\lambda_{0}\\,\\left(1+\\frac{v}{c}\\right)\\right]}\\\\\n & = & \\ln{\\lambda_{0}}+\\ln{\\left(1+\\frac{v}{c}\\right)}\\\\\n & \\simeq & \\ln{\\lambda_{0}}+\\frac{v}{c}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x & \\simeq & x_{0}+\\frac{v}{c.}\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\nLet $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ be the spectra of the primary and secondary\nin the heliocentric frame of reference.

For the separations we performed here,\nwe fixed the radial velocities of the binary components to those corresponding\nto the orbital solution of Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}).\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAs for any disentangling method, this technique also has its limitations\n(Gonz\u00e1lez \\& Levato \\cite{GL}). A reasonable observational sampling\nof the orbital cycle is needed because the quality of the results\ndepends on the radial velocity (RV) ranges covered by these observations.\nAnother important limitation is that broad spectral features are not\nrecovered with the same accuracy as narrow ones. This is the case\nfor the wings of the Balmer lines, but it also holds for the UV features\nthat arise in the stellar winds, such as P-Cygni profiles. For instance,\nfor the \\textit{IUE} spectra of HD~149\\,404, the \\ion{Si}{iv}\n$\\lambda$\\,1393-1403 and \\ion{N}{iv} $\\lambda$\\,1718 P-Cygni\nlines are very broad and barely vary during the orbital cycle. It\nwas therefore impossible to properly separate the primary and secondary\ncontributions for these lines. In practice, features that are wider\nthan a few times the RV amplitude are barely recovered. Moreover,\nsmall residual errors in the normalization of the input spectra can\nlead to oscillations of the continuum in the resulting separated spectra\non wavelength scales of several dozen \\AA{}. Finally, spectral disentangling\nworks on continuum-normalized spectra and does not yield the brightness\nratio of the stars, which must be determined by other techniques (see\nbelow).\n\nFinally, in the specific case of HD~149\\,404, several emission lines\n(H$\\alpha$ and He II $\\lambda$ 4686, for example) do not seem to\narise in the atmosphere of either component, but are formed at least\npartly in the wind-wind interaction zone (Rauw et al.\\ \\cite{Rauw},\nThaller et al.\\ \\cite{Thaller}, Naz\u00e9 et al.\\ \\cite{Naze}). As\na result, the disentangling code is unable to meaningfully reconstruct\nthese lines in the spectra of the components. We need to keep this\nin mind when analysing the reconstructed spectra.\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral types}\n\nBased on the reconstructed individual line spectra of the primary\nand secondary components, we determined the spectral types of the\nstars by measuring the equivalent width ratio of the spectral lines\nHe\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4471 and He\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4542\non the one hand, and Si\\,\\textsc{iv} $\\lambda$\\,4088 and He\\,\\textsc{i}\n$\\lambda$\\,4143, on the other hand. We applied Conti's quantitative\nclassification criteria for O-type stars (Conti \\& Alschuler \\cite{CA},\nConti \\& Frost \\cite{CF}, see also van der Hucht \\cite{vdHucht})\nfor both spectral types and luminosity classes to determine that the\nprimary star is an O7.5\\,If star, while the secondary is an ON9.7\\,I\n\\footnote{In the literature on interacting binaries, the terminologies ``primary''\nand ``secondary'' usually designate the initially more massive star\nand less massive star, respectively. However, in accordance with previous\nstudies of the HD~149\\,404 system, in the present paper the terms\n``primary'' and ``secondary'' star refer to the currently more\nmassive and less massive component, respectively.\n}. Since our classification is based on the separated spectra, it is\nless sensitive to a possible phase-dependence of the line strengths\nand should thus be more robust than a classification based on spectra\nthat are only collected near quadrature phase, as done by Rauw et\nal.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}). However, in this particular case, we find an\nexcellent agreement with the classification (O7.5\\,I(f) + ON9.7\\,I)\nproposed by these authors.\n\n\n\\subsection{Brightness ratio \\label{brightness}}\n\nSpectral disentangling yields the strength of the lines in the primary\nand secondary stars relative to the combined continuum, but does not\nallow establishing the relative strengths of the continua. To further\nanalyse the separated spectra, we therefore need to first establish\nthe brightness ratio of the stars.\n\nTo estimate the optical brightness ratio of the components of HD~149\\,404,\nwe measured the equivalent widths of a number of spectral lines on\nthe separated spectra of the primary and secondary, but referring\nto the combined continuum of the two stars. The results are listed\nin Table\\,\\ref{EW} along with the mean equivalent widths of the\nsame lines in synthetic spectra of stars of the same spectral type,\ncomputed with the non-LTE model atmosphere code CMFGEN (Hillier \\&\nMiller \\cite{HM}), which we describe in Sect.\\,\\ref{CMFGENcode}.\nFor comparison, we also list the mean equivalent widths of the same\nlines in spectra of stars of the same spectral type as evaluated from\nthe measurements of Conti (\\cite{Conti1,Conti2}) and Conti \\& Alschuler\n(\\cite{CA}).\n\n\\begin{table*}[thb]\n\\caption{Brightness ratio determination from the dilution of prominent lines}\n\n\n\\begin{centering}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|ccccccc}\n\\hline \nLine  & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Equivalent Width (\\AA{})} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{$l{}_{1}/l_{2}$}\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Observations} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Synthetic spectra} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Conti (\\cite{Conti1,Conti2}) } & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n & Primary  & Secondary  & O7.5  & O9.7  & O7.5  & O9.5  & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\hline \nHe\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4026  & 0.19  & 0.34  & 0.72  & 0.74  & 0.65  & 0.80  & 0.57\\tabularnewline\nSi\\,\\textsc{iv }$\\lambda$\\,4089  & 0.12  & 0.34  & 0.32  & 0.56  & 0.25  & 0.53  & 0.61\\tabularnewline\nSi\\,\\textsc{iv }$\\lambda$\\,4116  & 0.06  & 0.24  & 0.11  & 0.29  & 0.12  & 0.37  & 0.66\\tabularnewline\nHe\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4200  & 0.11  & 0.08  & 0.47  & 0.21  & 0.42  & 0.23  & 0.61\\tabularnewline\nH$\\gamma$  & 0.45  & 0.50  & 1.77  & 1.74  & 1.88  & 2.09  & 0.88\\tabularnewline\nHe\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4471  & 0.17  & 0.37  & 0.55  & 0.69  & 0.71  & 0.97  & 0.58\\tabularnewline\nHe\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4542  & 0.17  & 0.07  & 0.53  & 0.21  & 0.64  & 0.25  & 0.96\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\tablefoot{The measured EWs are compared with values for the same\nlines in synthetic spectra of the same spectral type and in the compilation\nof measurements from the literature.

As a consistency check, we also determined\nthe brightness ratio by comparison with Conti's measurements and obtained\n$0.79\\pm0.13$. The difference between the results obtained based\non synthetic spectra versus Conti's measurements arises at least partially\nbecause Conti (\\cite{Conti1,Conti2}) did not take into account the\nspectral type O9.7, but instead considered an O9.5 spectral type,\nconsisting of both classes of stars currently known as O9.5 and O9.7.\n\nReed (\\cite{Reed}) reported a mean $V$ magnitude of 5.48 $\\pm$\n0.02 and $B-V$ colour of $0.39\\pm0.02$ for the system.

The main effect of the macroturbulence\nis an additional broadening of the spectral lines. This effect has\nreceived much attention over recent years (e.g.\\ Sim\u00f3n-D\\'{i}az\n\\& Herrero \\cite{Simon-Diaz-1}). A first approximation of the macroturbulence\nvelocities is obtained by applying the radial-tangential anisotropic\nmacroturbulent broadening formulation of Gray (\\cite{Gray}) on the\nspectra after including rotational velocity broadening. We used the\nauxiliary program MACTURB of the stellar spectral synthesis program\nSPECTRUM v2.76 developed by Gray (\\cite{macturb}). We applied this\ntechnique to the lines \\ion{He}{i} $\\lambda\\lambda$ 4026, 4471,\nand 5016, and \\ion{He}{ii} $\\lambda$ 4542. In this way, we obtained\nmacroturbulence velocities of 70 and 80\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ for the primary\nand secondary stars, respectively. Although this is quite high, these\nnumbers are consistent with measurements of Sim\u00f3n-D\\'{i}az \\& Herrero\n(\\cite{Simon-Diaz-1}) that were made on stars of similar spectral\ntypes.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nBoth rotational and macroturbulence velocities were applied on the\nsynthetic spectra (see Sect.\\,\\ref{CMFGENcode}) before comparing\nthe latter with the separated spectra.\n\n\n\\subsection{CMFGEN code \\label{CMFGENcode}}\n\nTo determine the fundamental properties of the components of HD~149\\,404,\nwe used the non-LTE model atmosphere code CMFGEN (Hillier \\& Miller\n\\cite{HM}). This code solves the equations of radiative transfer\nand statistical equilibrium in the co-moving frame for plane-parallel\nor spherical geometries for Wolf-Rayet stars, O stars, luminous blue\nvariables, and supernovae. CMFGEN furthermore accounts for line blanketing\nand its effect on the energy distribution. The hydrodynamical structure\nof the stellar atmosphere is specified as an input to CMFGEN. For\nthe stellar wind, a $\\beta$ law is used to describe the velocity\nlaw. In the resolution of the equations of statistical equilibrium,\na super-level approach is adopted. The following chemical elements\nand their ions are included in the calculations: H, He, C, N, O, Ne,\nMg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni. The solution of the equations of statistical\nequilibrium is used to compute a new photospheric structure, which\nis then connected to the same $\\beta$ wind velocity law. The radiative\ntransfer equations are solved based on the structure of the atmosphere,\nwith a microturbulent velocity varying linearly with velocity from\n10 km s$^{-1}$ in the photosphere to $0.1$ \\texttimes{} v$_{\\infty}$\nat the outer boundary, and generated synthetic spectra are compared\nto the separated spectra.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAs a first approximation, we assumed that gravity, stellar mass, radius,\nand luminosity are either assumed equal to typical values of stars\nof the same spectral type (Martins et al.\\ \\cite{Martins2}) or adopted\nfrom the study of Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}). The mass-loss rates\nand $\\beta$ parameters were taken from Muijres et al.\\ (\\cite{Muijres})\nfor the spectral types of both stars, whilst the wind terminal velocity\nwas set equal to 2450\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ (Howarth et al.\\ \\cite{Howarth})\nfor the two components.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nThe relevant parameters were then adjusted by an iterative process\nbecause each adjustment of a given parameter leads to some modifications\nin the value of others. This process and the results we obtained are\npresented in Subsects. \\ref{Method} and \\ref{Results}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Method\\label{Method}}\n\nThe first step was to adjust the temperature in the stellar models.\nThe temperatures were mostly determined through the relative strengths\nof the He\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4471 and He\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4542\nlines (Martins \\cite{Martins}). The final values are 34\\,000 and\n28\\,000 K for the primary and secondary stars. Both results agree\nreasonably well with the temperatures expected for supergiants of\nthese spectral types (Martins et al.\\ \\cite{Martins2}).\n\nSubsequently, the natural steps to follow would be adjusting the surface\ngravities, the mass-loss rate, and the clumping factor, but the binarity\nof the studied system causes some problems. Indeed, since the wings\nof broad lines are not properly restored by the disentangling, it\nis impossible to use the Balmer lines to constrain the surface gravity.\nAnd since the H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines are in addition strongly\naffected by extra emission from the wind-wind interaction (Rauw et\nal.\\ \\cite{Rauw}, Thaller et al.\\ \\cite{Thaller}, Naz\u00e9 et al.\\ \\cite{Naze}),\nthey cannot be used as diagnostics of the mass-loss rate and clumping\nfactor. The mass-loss rates were therefore fixed to the values tabulated\nby Muijres et al.\\ (\\cite{Muijres}) for stars of the same spectral\ntype (see their Table\\,1, method A). The clumping formalism used\nin the CMFGEN model is\n\n\\begin{center}\n$f(r)=f_{1}+(1\\lyxmathsym{\\textminus}f_{1})e^{(\\lyxmathsym{\\textminus}\\frac{V(r)}{f_{2}})}$ \n\\par\\end{center}\n\n\\noindent with a filling factor $f_{1}$ of 0.1, a clumping velocity\nfactor $f_{2}$ of 100 kms$^{-1}$ , and V(r) the velocity of the\nwind.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nWe used an iterative process to constrain the luminosities and surface\ngravities. The first estimate of $\\log(g)$ was taken from Martins\net al.\\ (\\cite{Martins2}) following the spectral types of the stars.\nCombined with our determination of the effective temperatures, we\nthen inferred the bolometric corrections (Lanz \\& Hubeny \\cite{LH}).\nThis in turn yielded the individual bolometric luminosities, using\nthe absolute $V$ magnitudes of the components derived in Sect.\\,\\ref{brightness}.\n\nThese bolometric luminosities and the effective temperatures were\nused to compute the ratio of the stellar radii $\\frac{R_{P}}{R_{S}}$.\nTogether with the assumed gravities, this ratio yields the spectroscopic\nmass ratio $\\frac{M_{P}}{M_{S}}$ , which was then compared to the\ndynamical mass ratio inferred from the orbital solution (Rauw et al.\n\\cite{Rauw}). The difference in these mass ratios was used to produce\na new estimate of the surface gravities, and this iterative process\nwas repeated until the spectroscopic and dynamical mass ratios agreed\nwith each other and the CMFGEN synthetic spectra produced for the\nnew gravity values matched the observations as well as possible.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAfter the fundamental stellar parameters were established or fixed,\nwe investigated the CNO abundances through the strengths of the associated\nlines. We performed a normalized $\\chi^{2}$ analysis to determine\nthe best fit to selected lines (Martins et al. \\cite{Martins3}).\nThe normalization consists in dividing the $\\chi^{2}$ by its value\nat minimum, $\\chi\\text{\\texttwosuperior}{}_{min}$. As a 1$\\sigma$\nuncertainty on the abundances, we then considered abundances up to\na $\\chi^{2}$ of 2.0, that is, an approximation for 1 over $\\chi\\text{\\texttwosuperior}{}_{min}$,\nas suggested by Martins et al. (\\cite{Martins3}). We used the \\ion{C}{iii}\n$\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4068-70, \\ion{C}{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4267, \\ion{C}{iii}\n$\\lambda$\\,5826, \\ion{N}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,4004, \\ion{N}{iii}\n$\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4511-15-18-24, \\ion{N}{ii} $\\lambda$\\,5026,\n\\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5508, and \\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5592\nlines to adjust the C, N, and O abundances of the primary star. For\nthe secondary star, the same lines were used for the N and O abundances,\nbut the only line used for the C abundance was \\ion{C}{iii} $\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4068-70.\nTwo methods were used to determine the $\\chi^{2}$ of each line. First,\nwe compared the depth of the observed and synthetic line cores in\nthe calculation. Second, we determined the mean $\\chi^{2}$ for every\nindependent point of the full profile of each considered line. The\ntwo methods gave similar results. After testing the influence of the\nerrors on projected rotational velocities on the determination of\nthe surface abundances, we found that their effect was small compared\nto the 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties on the measured abundances as determined\nhere above. We therefore neglected them.\n\n\n\\subsection{Results\\label{Results}}\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{fig1} illustrates the best fit of the optical spectra\nof the primary and secondary stars obtained with CMFGEN. In Table\\,\\ref{CMFGENparam}\nwe present the stellar parameters determined compared to those derived\nby Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}). In general, these two works agree\nwell. Table\\,\\ref{table4} compares the chemical abundances of these\nbest-fit models with solar abundances taken from Asplund et al.\\ (\\cite{Asplund}).\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{fig1} shows that the He lines and the \\ion{C}{iii}\n$\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4068-70 lines are very well reproduced for both\nstars. The \\ion{C}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5696 line cannot be considered\nin the determination of the surface C abundance since its formation\nprocess depends on a number of fine details of atomic physics and\nof the modelling (Martins \\& Hillier \\cite{MH}). Most of the N lines\nalso are very well adjusted. The \\ion{N}{ii} emission lines around\n5000 \\AA{}\\ in the primary spectrum may be due to emission in the\ninteraction zone, as they are well present in the observed spectrum\nand not represented in the modelled spectrum. The case of oxygen is\nmore problematic. Whilst \\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5592 is well\nadjusted, several other \\ion{O}{iii} lines are present in the\nsynthetic CMFGEN spectra (e.g.\\ \\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda\\lambda$\\,\n4368, 4396, 4448, 4454, and 4458), but they are barely visible in\nthe separated spectra. We checked that these lines are also absent\nfrom the original observed binary spectra. Their absence is thus by\nno means an artefact that is due to the treatment of our data.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig1}\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig3b_2}\n\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig4}\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig5a}\n\\caption{Part of the normalized separated spectra of the primary (top, shifted\nupwards by 0.5 continuum units) and secondary stars (bottom), along\nwith the best-fit CMFGEN model spectra (red). \\label{fig1}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\caption{Stellar parameters of the primary and secondary stars as obtained\nwith CMFGEN \\label{CMFGENparam}}\n\n\n\\begin{centering}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{This study} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw})}\\tabularnewline\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & Prim.  & Sec.  & Prim.  & Sec.\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\hline \n$R$ (R$_{\\odot}$)  & $19.3\\pm2.2$  & $25.9\\pm3.4$  & $24.3\\pm0.7$  & $28.1\\pm0.7$\\tabularnewline\n$M$ (M$_{\\odot}$)  & $50.5\\pm20.1$  & $31.9\\pm9.5$  & $54.8\\pm4.6$  & $33.0\\pm2.8$\\tabularnewline\n$T_{{\\rm eff}}$ ($10^{4}$\\,K)  & $3.40\\pm0.15$  & $2.80\\pm0.15$  & $3.51\\pm0.1$  & $3.05\\pm0.04$\\tabularnewline\nlog ($\\frac{L}{L_{\\odot}}$)  & $5.63\\pm0.05$  & $5.58\\pm0.04$  & $5.90\\pm0.08$  & $5.78\\pm0.08$ \\tabularnewline\n$\\log{g}$ (cgs)  & $3.55\\pm0.15$  & $3.05\\pm0.15$  &  & \\tabularnewline\n$\\beta$  & 1.03 {\\scriptsize (f)}  & 1.08 {\\scriptsize (f)}  &  & \\tabularnewline\n$v_{\\infty}$ (km\\,s$^{-1}$)  & 2450 {\\scriptsize (f)}  & 2450 {\\scriptsize (f)}  &  & \\tabularnewline\n$\\dot{M}$ (M$_{\\odot}$\\,yr$^{-1})$  & $9.2\\times10^{-7}$ {\\scriptsize (f)}  & $3.3\\times10^{-7}$ {\\scriptsize (f)}  &  & \\tabularnewline\nBC  & $-3.17$  & $-2.67$  &  & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\tablefoot{The best-fit CMFGEN model parameters are compared with\nthe parameters obtained by Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}) for an orbital\ninclination of 21\\textdegree{}.

First\nof all, we confirm the large overabundance of N in the secondary spectrum.\nSecond, we infer an asynchronous rotation of the two stars. The radii\ndetermined with CMFGEN (Table 4), the mean projected rotational velocities\n(Table 1), and the inclination estimate from Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw})\nyield the rotation periods of the primary and secondary stars: 3.77\n$\\pm$ 0.32 days and 7.46 $\\pm$ 0.95 days, respectively, or a period\nratio of $0.50\\pm0.11$. We note that within the uncertainties on\nthe inclination, the secondary rotational period is similar to the\norbital period of the system (9.81 days).We return to these points\nin Sect.\\,\\ref{Conclusions}. Finally, we note that according to\nthe radii determined here, none of the stars currently fills its Roche\nlobe. With the formula of Eggleton (\\cite{Eggleton}), we estimate\na Roche-lobe volume filling factor of 15\\% for the primary and 73\\%\nfor the secondary.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAs pointed out above, disentangling the \\textit{IUE} spectra of HD~149\\,404\nwas more problematic, especially for those parts of the UV spectra\nthat feature strong and broad wind lines and/or are polluted by blends\nwith numerous interstellar features. The left panel of Fig.\\,\\ref{fig2}\nillustrates the comparison of the separated spectra and the synthetic\nspectra obtained with CMFGEN over a wavelength range that is relatively\nfree of interstellar lines and mainly hosts photospheric lines. The\nagreement is clearly quite reasonable.\n\nTo check whether our CMFGEN models are also able to correctly reproduce\nthe wind features, we re-combined the synthetic CMFGEN UV spectra\nof the primary and secondary taking into account the radial velocity\nshifts at the time of the observations. We did so for several orbital\nphases. The right panel of Fig.\\,\\ref{fig2} illustrates the result\nfor three selected \\textit{IUE} spectra (SWP03008, JD~2\\,443\\,798.965,\nSWP02755, JD 2\\,443\\,776.869, and SWP54350, JD 2\\,449\\,817.595),\ncorresponding to conjunction phase 0.00 and quadrature phases 0.75\nand 0.25. The synthetic spectrum clearly agrees well with the observation,\nexcept for a few narrow absorptions that are due to the interstellar\nmedium, which are not taken into account in our model. This additionally\nsupports our determination of the physical parameters of the system\ncomponents. Moreover, the concordance between the synthetic and observed\nUV spectra suggests that the P-Cygni profiles form over parts of the\nstellar winds that are not significantly affected by the wind-wind\ninteractions, the latter leading to a loss of spherical symmetry of\nthe line formation region.\n\nThe fluxed CMFGEN spectra also allow us to estimate the brightness\nratio (primary/secondary) in the UV. We find a value of 0.91\n\\footnote{This result is at odds with the 0.7\\,magnitude difference (i.e.\\ primary/secondary\nbrightness ratio of 1.91) between the primary and secondary UV fluxes\ninferred by Howarth et al.\\ (\\cite{Howarth}). This situation most\nlikely stems from the differences in the spectral types adopted by\nHowarth et al.\\ (\\cite{Howarth}), who classified the system as O8.5\\,I\n+ O7\\,III, whilst we have derived O7.5\\,If + ON9.7\\,I. This difference\nin spectral types directly affects the strength of the cross-correlation\npeaks of the spectra of the two components with the template spectrum\nof $\\tau$~Sco (B0.2\\,IV) and thus the correction on the magnitude\ndifference inferred by Howarth et al. (\\cite{Howarth}).\n}.\n\nFurthermore, we found relatively little variability of the P-Cygni\nprofiles over the orbital period. Both observations (lack of strong\nvariability and little effect of wind interaction on the line morphology)\nare likely due to the low orbital inclination ($i\\sim21^{\\circ}$)\nof the system. This inclination implies that the observed spectrum\narises mostly at high stellar latitudes, where the wind-wind interaction\nzone has less influence on the wind structure.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{domaine3}}\\qquad{} \\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 176bp 570bp 575bp,clip]{binary_phi000}}\n\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 176bp 570bp 575bp,clip]{binary_phi025}}\\qquad{}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 176bp 570bp 575bp,clip,scale=1.5]{binary_phi075}}\n\\caption{Upper left panel: comparison between the separated \\textit{IUE} spectra\n(black) of the primary and secondary stars around the \\ion{He}{ii}\n$\\lambda$\\,1640 line and the corresponding synthetic spectra (red).\nThe primary spectrum is shifted upwards by 0.5 for clarity.

These properties indicate\na previous mass-exchange episode. Figure\\,\\ref{CNO} compares our\ninferred N/C and N/O ratios with the predictions for the evolution\nof single massive stars (Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ \\cite{Ekstrom}) either\nwithout rotation (left panel) or with a rotational velocity of $0.4\\times v_{crit}$\n(right panel). This figure clearly shows that for the spectroscopic\nmasses of the primary and secondary stars these models cannot account\nfor the observed CNO abundance patterns. For instance, in the case\nof models without rotation (left-hand panel of Fig.\\,\\ref{CNO}),\nno chemical enrichment is expected during the main-sequence evolution\nfor stars with mass $<60$\\,M$_{\\odot}$. Only for the M$\\,>60\\, M_{\\odot}$\nmodel is the loss of material through stellar wind sufficient to reveal\nthe products of the CNO cycle at the surface before the end of the\nmain-sequence evolution. Adopting instead the rotating models (right-hand\npanel of Fig.\\,\\ref{CNO}), the enrichment of the secondary can only\nbe explained by single-star evolution if we assume at least a star\nwith 60\\,M$_{\\odot}$ , whilst the spectroscopic mass is about a\nfactor two lower. When the surface abundances of a single star of\n60\\,M$_{\\odot}$ initial mass reach the values observed for the secondary\nof HD~149\\,404, the current mass of the star is still about 50\\,M$_{\\odot}$,\nthat is, it is\\ much higher than the mass determined for the secondary\nstar.\n\nThe observed CNO abundance pattern is qualitatively much easier to\ninterpret if the present-day secondary star was formerly the more\nmassive component of the binary and transferred mass and angular momentum\nto the present-day primary in an RLOF episode. During this process,\nthe outer envelope of the secondary was removed, revealing layers\nof material that were previously inside the convective hydrogen-burning\ncore (Vanbeveren \\cite{Vanbeveren1,Vanbeveren}).\n\nWe start by comparing our results with theoretical predictions from\nthe literature. The expectation is that the more mass has been lost\nby the donor, the deeper the layers that are revealed at the surface\nand thus the higher the N/C ratio. The predicted CNO abundances for\nthe mass loser after a case B mass-transfer episode are $\\left[{\\rm N/C}\\right]=100\\,\\left[{\\rm N/C}\\right]_{\\odot}$\nand $\\left[{\\rm N/O}\\right]\\geq5\\,\\left[{\\rm N/O}\\right]_{\\odot}$\n(Vanbeveren \\cite{Vanbeveren1}). This is indeed close to what we\nobserve in our analysis. Moreover, the RLOF scenario is re-enforced\nby the values of the primary star abundances. Classical radiative\nequilibrium evolutionary models predict normal H and He abundances\nfor the mass gainer of an RLOF episode, but an N abundance of two\nto three times solar (Vanbeveren \\& de Loore \\cite{VdL}), which agrees\nwith our results.\n\nThere are some caveats here, however. First, the results of Vanbeveren\n(\\cite{Vanbeveren1}) apply to case B mass transfer, whereas HD~149\\,404\nis more likely to have undergone a case A mass exchange (see below).\nSecond, when the outer hydrogen-rich layers are removed, an enrichment\nof the stellar surface of the mass donor in helium is expected. Our\nspectral modelling was made with the He abundance set to solar, however,\nand there is no hint for our models requiring a He enhancement in\nany of the stars. Although the predicted relative change of helium\nsurface abundance is usually much smaller than for N, this result\nis nonetheless surprising, especially in view of the large N overabundance\nof the secondary star.\n\nTo illustrate the helium enrichment that might be expected, we consider\nonce more the single-star evolutionary tracks with rotation of Ekstr\u00f6m\net al.\\ (\\cite{Ekstrom}). In these models, a nitrogen surface abundance\nsimilar to the one observed for the secondary is always accompanied\nby an increase of the surface helium abundance to values higher than\n$y=0.35$ by mass. The fact that the spectrum of the secondary of\nHD~149\\,404 can be fit with a solar helium abundance ($y=0.1$)\nsuggests that the internal structure of the secondary before the onset\nof mass transfer must have been different from that expected from\nsingle-star evolutionary models. Moreover, the RLOF in HD~149\\,404\nmust have come to a (temporary) stop before the full hydrogen-rich\nenvelope of the mass donor was removed. The latter conclusion is also\nsupported by our finding that both stars are currently well inside\ntheir Roche lobes.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=0bp 170bp 584bp 705bp,clip]{HD149404CNOrot0}}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=0bp 170bp 584bp 705bp,clip]{HD149404CNOrot}}\n\\caption{Comparison of the N/C and N/O ratios determined from our spectral\nanalyses with predictions from single-star evolutionary models of\ndifferent masses (Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ \\cite{Ekstrom}).

Conservative RLOF will increase the period of the binary.\nIf we assume a fully conservative mass transfer and apply the formula\nof Vanbeveren et al.\\ (\\cite{VDLVR}), we find that the orbital period\nwould have increased by 17\\% at most, the shortest possible initial\norbital period being 8.4\\,days for a mass exchange of 9.3\\,M$_{\\odot}$.\nHowever, Petrovic et al.\\ (\\cite{Petrovic}) argued that in fast\ncase A RLOF, only about 15 -- 20\\% of the mass shed by the mass donor\nis indeed accreted by its companion. If the mass-transfer efficiency\nis that low, then the secondary must have lost a much larger amount\nof mass. Such a non-conservative mass transfer can result from the\ntransfer of angular momentum. In fact, the mass gainer can be spun\nup to critical rotation and will then repel additional mass (and angular\nmomentum), leading to a non-conservative mass transfer (e.g.\\ Langer\net al.\\ \\cite{Langer}, Vanbeveren \\cite{Vanbeveren}, Langer \\cite{Langer1}).\nIn the previous section, we noted that the components of the system\nare apparently not in synchronous rotation. This asynchronicity therefore\nalso suggests the existence of a past mass and angular momentum transfer\nepisode, with a clear spin up of the primary star. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn Fig.\\,\\ref{HRD} we present the positions of the primary and secondary\nstars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) (upper panels) and\nin the log\\,g-log\\,$T_{{\\rm eff}}$ diagram (lower panels), along\nwith the evolutionary tracks from Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ (\\cite{Ekstrom})\nfor the core-hydrogen burning phase of single stars at solar metallicity,\nboth for non-rotating (left panels) and rotating (right panels) stars.\nThis figure again illustrates the failure of single-star evolutionary\ntracks to account for the properties of the components of HD~149\\,404.\nIf we consider the models without rotational mixing, the position\nof the primary star in the HRD is relatively close to the track corresponding\nto its present-day spectroscopic mass. However, the secondary appears\ntoo luminous for its present-day mass compared to these evolutionary\ntracks. If we compare the stars to the 40\\% critical rotation case,\nwe find that the primary's luminosity is below that expected for its\npresent-day spectroscopic mass. Moreover, the secondary lies outside\nthe range covered by tracks in the core-hydrogen burning phase. If\nwe consider the non-rotating case, we see that in the log\\,g-log\\,$T_{{\\rm eff}}$\ndiagram the primary star has a lower effective temperature and a higher\nsurface gravity than expected for a 50 M$_{\\odot}$ star, whilst the\nsecondary star displays parameters corresponding to stars twice as\nmassive as its present-day spectroscopic mass. For stars rotating\nat 40\\% of their critical velocity, we find that both stars would\nhave initial masses of about 30 M$_{\\odot}$. The primary dynamical\nmass is about a factor 2 higher, while for the secondary the agreement\nis good. Finally, in all cases (with and without rotation and for\nboth diagrams), the two components of HD~149\\,404 are not located\non the same isochrone, although they would be expected to have the\nsame age\n\\footnote{The age of the Ara\\,OB1 association of which HD~149\\,404 is a member\nwas estimated in the literature as $\\sim3$ Myr (Wolk et al.\\ \\cite{Wolk}).\n}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=40bp 175bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404hrdrot0_2}}\\enskip{}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=40bp 175bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404hrdrot_2}}\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 178bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404gTrot0}}\\enskip{}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 178bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404gTrot}}\n\n\\caption{Position of the primary (open square) and secondary (filled square)\nstars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (upper panels) and the log\\,g-log\\,$T_{{\\rm eff}}$\ndiagram (lower panels) along with evolutionary tracks for single massive\nstars at solar metallicity during the core-hydrogen burning phase\n(Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ \\cite{Ekstrom}).

For\ninstance, spinning-up the mass gainer can lead to almost complete\nmixing of the latter. In this situation, models predict that He would\nbe enhanced in the atmosphere of the mass gainer and that the latter\nwould become bluer and overluminous for its mass (Vanbeveren \\& de\nLoore \\cite{VdL}). If there is no strong spin-up and the accretion\noccurs rather slowly and is accompanied by a fast diffusion process,\nthen the location of the gainer in the HRD should be very close to\nthat of a normal star of the same mass and chemical composition (Vanbeveren\net al.\\ \\cite{VDLVR}). The star is rejuvenated, however: it lies\non an isochrone that corresponds to a younger age than its actual\nage. The location of the primary in the HRD suggests that in the present\ncase the second scenario is likely to apply with a very moderate rejuvenation,\nif any, of the primary. This conclusion is supported by the lack of\na strong He enrichment, but it is at odds with the highly non-synchronous\nrotation of the primary reported above.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Comparison with other post-RLOF systems}\n\nIn this section, we briefly compare the properties of HD~149\\,404\nwith those of two other O-type binaries, Plaskett's Star and LZ\\,Cephei,\nwhich are probably in a post-case A RLOF evolutionary stage and have\nbeen analysed in a way similar to the present work (Linder et al.\\ \\cite{Linder},\nMahy et al.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}).\\\\\n\n\nPlaskett's Star (HD~47\\,129) is an O8\\,III/I + O7.5\\,III binary\nwith an orbital period of 14.4\\,days, slightly longer than that of\nHD~149\\,404, and a mass ratio near unity. Two observational facts\nsuggest that the initially more massive primary has undergone a case\nA RLOF episode in the past (Linder et al.\\ \\cite{Linder}). First,\nthe projected rotational velocity of the secondary star is remarkably\nhigh (mean value of $272.5\\pm35.0$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$) compared to\nthat of the primary (mean value of $65.7\\pm6.3$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$).\nThis strongly asynchronous rotation likely stems from a spin-up of\nthe secondary star through a recent transfer of angular momentum from\nthe primary star. Second, the primary star displays nitrogen overabundance\n(N/N$_{\\odot}=16.6\\pm5.0$) and carbon depletion (C/C$_{\\odot}=0.2\\pm0.1$),\nas is typical of an advanced evolutionary stage, whilst no such nitrogen\nenrichment is seen in the secondary spectrum\n\\footnote{The apparent N underabundance of the secondary inferred by Linder\net al.\\ (\\cite{Linder}) could be an artefact that is due to the\nrelatively shallow nitrogen lines of the secondary being washed out\nby its fast rotation and the difficulties of properly normalizing\nechelle spectra with such broad and shallow features (see also Fig.\\,1\nof Palate \\& Rauw \\cite{PR}).\n}. Given the present-day configuration of HD~47\\,129, it seems that\nthe transfer of angular momentum and the resulting spin-up of the\nmass gainer (the secondary in this case) might have prevented accretion\nof a larger portion of the primary's mass.\\\\\n\n\nLZ\\,Cephei (HD~209\\,481) is an O9\\,III + ON9.7\\,V binary with\na short orbital period of 3.07\\,days (Kameswara Rao \\cite{Rao})\nand a mass ratio (primary/secondary) of 2.53 (Mahy et al.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}).\nBoth components of LZ\\,Cep almost fill their Roche lobe (Mahy et\nal.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}, Palate et al.\\ \\cite{PRM}). Mahy et al.\\ (\\cite{Mahy1})\nfound that the secondary displays a strong nitrogen enrichment (18\ntimes solar), carbon and oxygen depletion (0.1 times solar), and a\nhigh helium content (4 times solar), suggesting a very advanced state\nof evolution. On the other hand, the primary displays only slightly\naltered surface abundances consistent with single-star evolution.\nThis suggests that the mass transfer was strongly non-conservative.\nMahy et al.\\ (\\cite{Mahy1}) noted a slight asynchronicity of the\nrotation periods of the order of 10-20 \\%, but concluded that the\nsystem is probably on the verge of achieving synchronization. Comparison\nwith single-star evolutionary tracks indicates a similar age discrepancy\nas we have found here for HD~149\\,404. The evolutionary masses ($25.3_{-4.0}^{+6.2}$\nand $18.0_{-2.5}^{+2.4}$\\,M$_{\\odot}$, for the primary and secondary\nrespectively) are significantly higher than their dynamical masses\n($16.9\\pm1.0$ and $6.7\\pm1.0$ M$_{\\odot}$ respectively, Mahy et\nal.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}, Palate et al.\\ \\cite{PRM}).\\\\\n\n\nAlthough our sample is currently too limited to draw firm conclusions,\nthe above comparison reveals several interesting results that are\nworth studying in more detail with a larger sample. First, we note\nthat in all three systems, the components appear either over- or under-luminous\nwhen compared with single-star evolutionary tracks corresponding to\ntheir present-day masses. During its initial phases, case A mass transfer\noccurs on a thermal timescale leading to a very rapid mass exchange.\nHowever, the mass transfer subsequently slows down and occurs on a\nnuclear timescale instead. By the time the mass transfer ends, both\nstars would therefore be expected to be in thermal equilibrium again.\nSince all three systems under consideration are in a detached configuration,\nthe stars should thus have settled onto their new post-RLOF evolutionary\ntracks. The discrepancy between the observed luminosities and those\npredicted by the single-star evolutionary tracks most likely stems\nfrom several effects, such as observational uncertainties, altered\nchemical compositions (and hence opacities of the stellar material),\nand a rotational velocity history that differs from that assumed in\nthe single-star models.\n\nOur comparison shows that the degree of asynchronicity in the three\npost-RLOF systems increases with orbital period (from LZ\\,Cep, over\nHD~149\\,404 to HD~47\\,129). This is most probably due to the higher\nefficiency of the tidal forcing in shorter period systems, or it might\nbe seen as evidence that momentum transfer has played a larger role\nin those systems that have a wider present-day orbital separation.\nThis is expected since binary evolution models predict spin-up to\nbe less efficient in closer systems because in such systems the accretion\nstream directly affects the mass gainer without forming an accretion\ndisk (e.g.\\ Langer \\cite{Langer1}). The questions of synchronization\nand circularization in close binary systems with early-type stars,\nfeaturing radiative envelopes and convective cores, have been addressed\nby Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1}) and Tassoul (\\cite{Tassoul}). Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1})\nconsidered radiative damping of the dynamical tide in the outer layers\nof the stellar envelopes as the main mechanism for synchronization.\nThe corresponding synchronization timescales strongly depend upon\nthe tidal torque constant $E_{2}$ , which varies by several orders\nof magnitude during the main-sequence lifetime of the star (Zahn \\cite{Zahn2}).\nSiess et al.\\ (\\cite{Siess}) provided a parametrization of this\nparameter as a function of stellar mass and relative age of the star.\nAssuming that their formalism holds for the masses of the stars considered\nhere and adopting an age of half the main-sequence age of the stars,\nwe estimated the values of $E_{2}$. We then evaluated the synchronization\ntimes following Eq. 4.28 of Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1}) by means of moments\nof inertia tabulated by Claret \\& Gim\u00e9nez (\\cite{CG}). The results\nare $5.6\\times10^{5}$ and $1.4\\times10^{4}$\\,years for the primary\nand secondary stars of HD~149\\,404, respectively, $4.4\\times10^{6}$\nand $27.6\\times10^{6}$\\,years for the primary and secondary of Plaskett's\nstar, and $2.8\\times10^{4}$ and $2.5\\times10^{4}$\\,years for the\nprimary and secondary components of LZ~Cephei. Tassoul (\\cite{Tassoul}),\non the other hand, proposed that the most effective mechanism for\nsynchronization is provided by large-scale hydrodynamic motions in\nthe interiors of the tidally distorted binary components. The resulting\ntimescales are considerably shorter than those estimated following\nthe formalism of Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1}). We estimate synchronization\ntimescales of $2.1\\times10^{4}$ and $3.2\\times10^{3}$\\,years for\nHD~149\\,404, $7.2\\times10^{4}$ and $2.0\\times10^{5}$\\,years for\nPlaskett's star, and $1.6\\times10^{3}$ and $6\\times10^{2}$\\,years\nfor LZ~Cep. Regardless of which of the two formalisms is most appropriate\nto describe the evolution of rotation in the systems considered here,\nwe find that, except perhaps for Plaskett's Star, which has a longer\nsynchronization timescale, the RLOF phase probably must have ended\nless than a few $10^{4}$\\,years ago. \n\n\nAnother puzzling result is the fact that the post-RLOF mass-ratio\ndeviates most from unity for the shortest period system (LZ\\,Cep).\nTherefore, in this system, the RLOF must have been comparatively more\nefficient than in the longer period systems. As discussed above, the\nmass transfer in LZ\\,Cep was most likely highly non-conservative.\nIf the material lost by the system does not carry away angular momentum\nin addition to the intrinsic orbital angular momentum, such a non-conservative\nmass loss leads to a widening of the orbital separation $a$ given\nby\n\n\\begin{center}\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 10290, "prevtext": "\n}And similarly for the secondary: {\\small \n", "index": 5, "text": "\n\\[\nB(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[S_{i}\\left(x+\\frac{v_{B}(\\phi_{i})}{c}\\right)-A\\left(x-\\frac{v_{A}(\\phi_{i})}{c}+\\frac{v_{B}(\\phi_{i})}{c}\\right)\\right]\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"B(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[S_{i}\\left(x+\\frac{v_{B}(\\phi_{i})}{c}%&#10;\\right)-A\\left(x-\\frac{v_{A}(\\phi_{i})}{c}+\\frac{v_{B}(\\phi_{i})}{c}\\right)\\right]\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>n</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>c</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>c</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>c</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.08083.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\par\\end{center}\n\nwhere $\\dot{M}<0$ is the mass-loss rate (Singh \\& Chaubey \\cite{SC},\nTout \\& Hall \\cite{TH}). Assuming a fully non-conservative mass loss,\nthis would imply that the initial orbital period of LZ\\,Cep must\nhave been shorter than 1.5\\,days. The duration of the RLOF episode\ndepends on the evolution of the Roche-lobe filling factor of the mass\ndonor. The evolution of the size of the Roche lobe is set by the relative\nimportance of the orbit expansion and the shrinking of the relative\nsize of the mass donor's Roche lobe. In addition, the evolution of\nthe radius of the mass donor needs to be accounted for (see Tout \\&\nHall \\cite{TH}). Since massive stars with radiative envelopes contract\nconsiderably on a dynamical timescale (Tout \\& Hall \\cite{TH}) and\nin view of the current mass-ratio of LZ\\,Cep (Mahy et al.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}),\nit seems unlikely that a non-conservative RLOF could be the explanation\nfor a more efficient mass loss. Alternatively, if the material lost\nby the system carried off additional angular momentum, then the result\ncould be a shrinking of the orbit. In active, low-mass stars, such\na situation could arise if the material lost by the donor corotates\nwith the latter under the effect of a magnetic field out to a wide\ndistance (Tout \\& Hall \\cite{TH}). However, strong magnetic fields\nare fairly rare among single massive stars ($\\sim7$\\,\\%), and their\nincidence appears even lower among massive binaries (Neiner et al.\\ \\cite{Neiner}).\nHence, this scenario also appears very unlikely in the case of LZ\\,Cep.\n\nClearly, the above trends call for confirmation by studying a larger\nsample of post-case A RLOF massive binary systems. We are currently\nundertaking such studies, and the results will be presented in forthcoming\npublications.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Summary and conclusion}\n\nWe analysed the fundamental properties of the binary system HD 149\\,404\nby means of spectral disentangling and the CMFGEN atmosphere code.\nOur investigation of this object represents a significant improvement\nover previous studies because we have obtained the individual spectra\nof each component. This led to the determination of a number of stellar\nparameters that were used to constrain the evolutionary status of\nthe system.\n\nWe established the existence of a large overabundance in N and a C\nand O depletion in the secondary star and also found a slight N enhancement\nin the primary's spectrum. We showed that these surface abundances\ncannot be explained by single-star evolutionary models. Furthermore,\nwe inferred an asynchronous rotation of the two stars of the system.\nThese two results indicate a previous mass and angular momentum-exchange\nphase through a Roche-lobe overflow episode. Given the present status\nof HD 149\\,404 as an O+O binary, this mass transfer probably was\na case A RLOF.

For the separations we performed here,\nwe fixed the radial velocities of the binary components to those corresponding\nto the orbital solution of Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}).\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAs for any disentangling method, this technique also has its limitations\n(Gonz\u00e1lez \\& Levato \\cite{GL}). A reasonable observational sampling\nof the orbital cycle is needed because the quality of the results\ndepends on the radial velocity (RV) ranges covered by these observations.\nAnother important limitation is that broad spectral features are not\nrecovered with the same accuracy as narrow ones. This is the case\nfor the wings of the Balmer lines, but it also holds for the UV features\nthat arise in the stellar winds, such as P-Cygni profiles. For instance,\nfor the \\textit{IUE} spectra of HD~149\\,404, the \\ion{Si}{iv}\n$\\lambda$\\,1393-1403 and \\ion{N}{iv} $\\lambda$\\,1718 P-Cygni\nlines are very broad and barely vary during the orbital cycle. It\nwas therefore impossible to properly separate the primary and secondary\ncontributions for these lines. In practice, features that are wider\nthan a few times the RV amplitude are barely recovered. Moreover,\nsmall residual errors in the normalization of the input spectra can\nlead to oscillations of the continuum in the resulting separated spectra\non wavelength scales of several dozen \\AA{}. Finally, spectral disentangling\nworks on continuum-normalized spectra and does not yield the brightness\nratio of the stars, which must be determined by other techniques (see\nbelow).\n\nFinally, in the specific case of HD~149\\,404, several emission lines\n(H$\\alpha$ and He II $\\lambda$ 4686, for example) do not seem to\narise in the atmosphere of either component, but are formed at least\npartly in the wind-wind interaction zone (Rauw et al.\\ \\cite{Rauw},\nThaller et al.\\ \\cite{Thaller}, Naz\u00e9 et al.\\ \\cite{Naze}). As\na result, the disentangling code is unable to meaningfully reconstruct\nthese lines in the spectra of the components. We need to keep this\nin mind when analysing the reconstructed spectra.\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral types}\n\nBased on the reconstructed individual line spectra of the primary\nand secondary components, we determined the spectral types of the\nstars by measuring the equivalent width ratio of the spectral lines\nHe\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4471 and He\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4542\non the one hand, and Si\\,\\textsc{iv} $\\lambda$\\,4088 and He\\,\\textsc{i}\n$\\lambda$\\,4143, on the other hand. We applied Conti's quantitative\nclassification criteria for O-type stars (Conti \\& Alschuler \\cite{CA},\nConti \\& Frost \\cite{CF}, see also van der Hucht \\cite{vdHucht})\nfor both spectral types and luminosity classes to determine that the\nprimary star is an O7.5\\,If star, while the secondary is an ON9.7\\,I\n\\footnote{In the literature on interacting binaries, the terminologies ``primary''\nand ``secondary'' usually designate the initially more massive star\nand less massive star, respectively. However, in accordance with previous\nstudies of the HD~149\\,404 system, in the present paper the terms\n``primary'' and ``secondary'' star refer to the currently more\nmassive and less massive component, respectively.\n}. Since our classification is based on the separated spectra, it is\nless sensitive to a possible phase-dependence of the line strengths\nand should thus be more robust than a classification based on spectra\nthat are only collected near quadrature phase, as done by Rauw et\nal.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}). However, in this particular case, we find an\nexcellent agreement with the classification (O7.5\\,I(f) + ON9.7\\,I)\nproposed by these authors.\n\n\n\\subsection{Brightness ratio \\label{brightness}}\n\nSpectral disentangling yields the strength of the lines in the primary\nand secondary stars relative to the combined continuum, but does not\nallow establishing the relative strengths of the continua. To further\nanalyse the separated spectra, we therefore need to first establish\nthe brightness ratio of the stars.\n\nTo estimate the optical brightness ratio of the components of HD~149\\,404,\nwe measured the equivalent widths of a number of spectral lines on\nthe separated spectra of the primary and secondary, but referring\nto the combined continuum of the two stars. The results are listed\nin Table\\,\\ref{EW} along with the mean equivalent widths of the\nsame lines in synthetic spectra of stars of the same spectral type,\ncomputed with the non-LTE model atmosphere code CMFGEN (Hillier \\&\nMiller \\cite{HM}), which we describe in Sect.\\,\\ref{CMFGENcode}.\nFor comparison, we also list the mean equivalent widths of the same\nlines in spectra of stars of the same spectral type as evaluated from\nthe measurements of Conti (\\cite{Conti1,Conti2}) and Conti \\& Alschuler\n(\\cite{CA}).\n\n\\begin{table*}[thb]\n\\caption{Brightness ratio determination from the dilution of prominent lines}\n\n\n\\begin{centering}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|ccccccc}\n\\hline \nLine  & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Equivalent Width (\\AA{})} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{$l{}_{1}/l_{2}$}\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Observations} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Synthetic spectra} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Conti (\\cite{Conti1,Conti2}) } & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n & Primary  & Secondary  & O7.5  & O9.7  & O7.5  & O9.5  & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\hline \nHe\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4026  & 0.19  & 0.34  & 0.72  & 0.74  & 0.65  & 0.80  & 0.57\\tabularnewline\nSi\\,\\textsc{iv }$\\lambda$\\,4089  & 0.12  & 0.34  & 0.32  & 0.56  & 0.25  & 0.53  & 0.61\\tabularnewline\nSi\\,\\textsc{iv }$\\lambda$\\,4116  & 0.06  & 0.24  & 0.11  & 0.29  & 0.12  & 0.37  & 0.66\\tabularnewline\nHe\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4200  & 0.11  & 0.08  & 0.47  & 0.21  & 0.42  & 0.23  & 0.61\\tabularnewline\nH$\\gamma$  & 0.45  & 0.50  & 1.77  & 1.74  & 1.88  & 2.09  & 0.88\\tabularnewline\nHe\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4471  & 0.17  & 0.37  & 0.55  & 0.69  & 0.71  & 0.97  & 0.58\\tabularnewline\nHe\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4542  & 0.17  & 0.07  & 0.53  & 0.21  & 0.64  & 0.25  & 0.96\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\tablefoot{The measured EWs are compared with values for the same\nlines in synthetic spectra of the same spectral type and in the compilation\nof measurements from the literature.

As a consistency check, we also determined\nthe brightness ratio by comparison with Conti's measurements and obtained\n$0.79\\pm0.13$. The difference between the results obtained based\non synthetic spectra versus Conti's measurements arises at least partially\nbecause Conti (\\cite{Conti1,Conti2}) did not take into account the\nspectral type O9.7, but instead considered an O9.5 spectral type,\nconsisting of both classes of stars currently known as O9.5 and O9.7.\n\nReed (\\cite{Reed}) reported a mean $V$ magnitude of 5.48 $\\pm$\n0.02 and $B-V$ colour of $0.39\\pm0.02$ for the system. Since the\nintrinsic $(B-V)_{0}$ of an O7.5 or O9.5 star is $-0.26$ (Martins\n\\& Plez \\cite{MP}), the extinction $A_{V}$ can be calculated as\nbeing $2.02\\pm0.06$, assuming $R_{V}=3.1$. Assuming the 1.3\\,$\\pm$\\,0.1\nkpc distance (Wolk et al.\\ \\cite{Wolk}), we infer an absolute $M_{V}=-7.11\\pm0.07$\nfor the binary. A brightness ratio of $l{}_{1}/l_{2}=0.70\\pm0.12$\nthen yields individual absolute magnitudes of $M_{V}^{P}=-6.15\\pm0.13$\nand $M_{V}^{S}=-6.53\\pm0.10$.\n\nThe separated continuum-normalized primary and secondary optical spectra\nare shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig1}.\n\n\n\\section{Spectral analysis \\textmd{\\label{Modelatmosphere}}}\n\n\n\\subsection{Rotational velocities and macroturbulence}\n\nAfter applying a Fourier transform method (Sim\u00f3n-D\u00edaz \\& Herrero \\cite{Simon-Diaz},\nGray \\cite{Gray}) to the profiles of the He\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4026,\n4922, 5016, O\\,\\textsc{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5592, and C\\,\\textsc{iv}\n$\\lambda$\\, 5812 lines of the separated spectra, we determined the\nprojected rotational velocities $v\\,\\sin{i}$ of the stars of the\nsystem.

The main effect of the macroturbulence\nis an additional broadening of the spectral lines. This effect has\nreceived much attention over recent years (e.g.\\ Sim\u00f3n-D\\'{i}az\n\\& Herrero \\cite{Simon-Diaz-1}). A first approximation of the macroturbulence\nvelocities is obtained by applying the radial-tangential anisotropic\nmacroturbulent broadening formulation of Gray (\\cite{Gray}) on the\nspectra after including rotational velocity broadening. We used the\nauxiliary program MACTURB of the stellar spectral synthesis program\nSPECTRUM v2.76 developed by Gray (\\cite{macturb}). We applied this\ntechnique to the lines \\ion{He}{i} $\\lambda\\lambda$ 4026, 4471,\nand 5016, and \\ion{He}{ii} $\\lambda$ 4542. In this way, we obtained\nmacroturbulence velocities of 70 and 80\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ for the primary\nand secondary stars, respectively. Although this is quite high, these\nnumbers are consistent with measurements of Sim\u00f3n-D\\'{i}az \\& Herrero\n(\\cite{Simon-Diaz-1}) that were made on stars of similar spectral\ntypes.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nBoth rotational and macroturbulence velocities were applied on the\nsynthetic spectra (see Sect.\\,\\ref{CMFGENcode}) before comparing\nthe latter with the separated spectra.\n\n\n\\subsection{CMFGEN code \\label{CMFGENcode}}\n\nTo determine the fundamental properties of the components of HD~149\\,404,\nwe used the non-LTE model atmosphere code CMFGEN (Hillier \\& Miller\n\\cite{HM}). This code solves the equations of radiative transfer\nand statistical equilibrium in the co-moving frame for plane-parallel\nor spherical geometries for Wolf-Rayet stars, O stars, luminous blue\nvariables, and supernovae. CMFGEN furthermore accounts for line blanketing\nand its effect on the energy distribution. The hydrodynamical structure\nof the stellar atmosphere is specified as an input to CMFGEN. For\nthe stellar wind, a $\\beta$ law is used to describe the velocity\nlaw. In the resolution of the equations of statistical equilibrium,\na super-level approach is adopted. The following chemical elements\nand their ions are included in the calculations: H, He, C, N, O, Ne,\nMg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni. The solution of the equations of statistical\nequilibrium is used to compute a new photospheric structure, which\nis then connected to the same $\\beta$ wind velocity law. The radiative\ntransfer equations are solved based on the structure of the atmosphere,\nwith a microturbulent velocity varying linearly with velocity from\n10 km s$^{-1}$ in the photosphere to $0.1$ \\texttimes{} v$_{\\infty}$\nat the outer boundary, and generated synthetic spectra are compared\nto the separated spectra.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAs a first approximation, we assumed that gravity, stellar mass, radius,\nand luminosity are either assumed equal to typical values of stars\nof the same spectral type (Martins et al.\\ \\cite{Martins2}) or adopted\nfrom the study of Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}). The mass-loss rates\nand $\\beta$ parameters were taken from Muijres et al.\\ (\\cite{Muijres})\nfor the spectral types of both stars, whilst the wind terminal velocity\nwas set equal to 2450\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ (Howarth et al.\\ \\cite{Howarth})\nfor the two components.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nThe relevant parameters were then adjusted by an iterative process\nbecause each adjustment of a given parameter leads to some modifications\nin the value of others. This process and the results we obtained are\npresented in Subsects. \\ref{Method} and \\ref{Results}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Method\\label{Method}}\n\nThe first step was to adjust the temperature in the stellar models.\nThe temperatures were mostly determined through the relative strengths\nof the He\\,\\textsc{i} $\\lambda$\\,4471 and He\\,\\textsc{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4542\nlines (Martins \\cite{Martins}). The final values are 34\\,000 and\n28\\,000 K for the primary and secondary stars. Both results agree\nreasonably well with the temperatures expected for supergiants of\nthese spectral types (Martins et al.\\ \\cite{Martins2}).\n\nSubsequently, the natural steps to follow would be adjusting the surface\ngravities, the mass-loss rate, and the clumping factor, but the binarity\nof the studied system causes some problems. Indeed, since the wings\nof broad lines are not properly restored by the disentangling, it\nis impossible to use the Balmer lines to constrain the surface gravity.\nAnd since the H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines are in addition strongly\naffected by extra emission from the wind-wind interaction (Rauw et\nal.\\ \\cite{Rauw}, Thaller et al.\\ \\cite{Thaller}, Naz\u00e9 et al.\\ \\cite{Naze}),\nthey cannot be used as diagnostics of the mass-loss rate and clumping\nfactor. The mass-loss rates were therefore fixed to the values tabulated\nby Muijres et al.\\ (\\cite{Muijres}) for stars of the same spectral\ntype (see their Table\\,1, method A). The clumping formalism used\nin the CMFGEN model is\n\n\\begin{center}\n$f(r)=f_{1}+(1\\lyxmathsym{\\textminus}f_{1})e^{(\\lyxmathsym{\\textminus}\\frac{V(r)}{f_{2}})}$ \n\\par\\end{center}\n\n\\noindent with a filling factor $f_{1}$ of 0.1, a clumping velocity\nfactor $f_{2}$ of 100 kms$^{-1}$ , and V(r) the velocity of the\nwind.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nWe used an iterative process to constrain the luminosities and surface\ngravities. The first estimate of $\\log(g)$ was taken from Martins\net al.\\ (\\cite{Martins2}) following the spectral types of the stars.\nCombined with our determination of the effective temperatures, we\nthen inferred the bolometric corrections (Lanz \\& Hubeny \\cite{LH}).\nThis in turn yielded the individual bolometric luminosities, using\nthe absolute $V$ magnitudes of the components derived in Sect.\\,\\ref{brightness}.\n\nThese bolometric luminosities and the effective temperatures were\nused to compute the ratio of the stellar radii $\\frac{R_{P}}{R_{S}}$.\nTogether with the assumed gravities, this ratio yields the spectroscopic\nmass ratio $\\frac{M_{P}}{M_{S}}$ , which was then compared to the\ndynamical mass ratio inferred from the orbital solution (Rauw et al.\n\\cite{Rauw}). The difference in these mass ratios was used to produce\na new estimate of the surface gravities, and this iterative process\nwas repeated until the spectroscopic and dynamical mass ratios agreed\nwith each other and the CMFGEN synthetic spectra produced for the\nnew gravity values matched the observations as well as possible.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAfter the fundamental stellar parameters were established or fixed,\nwe investigated the CNO abundances through the strengths of the associated\nlines. We performed a normalized $\\chi^{2}$ analysis to determine\nthe best fit to selected lines (Martins et al. \\cite{Martins3}).\nThe normalization consists in dividing the $\\chi^{2}$ by its value\nat minimum, $\\chi\\text{\\texttwosuperior}{}_{min}$. As a 1$\\sigma$\nuncertainty on the abundances, we then considered abundances up to\na $\\chi^{2}$ of 2.0, that is, an approximation for 1 over $\\chi\\text{\\texttwosuperior}{}_{min}$,\nas suggested by Martins et al. (\\cite{Martins3}). We used the \\ion{C}{iii}\n$\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4068-70, \\ion{C}{ii} $\\lambda$\\,4267, \\ion{C}{iii}\n$\\lambda$\\,5826, \\ion{N}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,4004, \\ion{N}{iii}\n$\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4511-15-18-24, \\ion{N}{ii} $\\lambda$\\,5026,\n\\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5508, and \\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5592\nlines to adjust the C, N, and O abundances of the primary star. For\nthe secondary star, the same lines were used for the N and O abundances,\nbut the only line used for the C abundance was \\ion{C}{iii} $\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4068-70.\nTwo methods were used to determine the $\\chi^{2}$ of each line. First,\nwe compared the depth of the observed and synthetic line cores in\nthe calculation. Second, we determined the mean $\\chi^{2}$ for every\nindependent point of the full profile of each considered line. The\ntwo methods gave similar results. After testing the influence of the\nerrors on projected rotational velocities on the determination of\nthe surface abundances, we found that their effect was small compared\nto the 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties on the measured abundances as determined\nhere above. We therefore neglected them.\n\n\n\\subsection{Results\\label{Results}}\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{fig1} illustrates the best fit of the optical spectra\nof the primary and secondary stars obtained with CMFGEN. In Table\\,\\ref{CMFGENparam}\nwe present the stellar parameters determined compared to those derived\nby Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}). In general, these two works agree\nwell. Table\\,\\ref{table4} compares the chemical abundances of these\nbest-fit models with solar abundances taken from Asplund et al.\\ (\\cite{Asplund}).\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{fig1} shows that the He lines and the \\ion{C}{iii}\n$\\lambda\\lambda$\\,4068-70 lines are very well reproduced for both\nstars. The \\ion{C}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5696 line cannot be considered\nin the determination of the surface C abundance since its formation\nprocess depends on a number of fine details of atomic physics and\nof the modelling (Martins \\& Hillier \\cite{MH}). Most of the N lines\nalso are very well adjusted. The \\ion{N}{ii} emission lines around\n5000 \\AA{}\\ in the primary spectrum may be due to emission in the\ninteraction zone, as they are well present in the observed spectrum\nand not represented in the modelled spectrum. The case of oxygen is\nmore problematic. Whilst \\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda$\\,5592 is well\nadjusted, several other \\ion{O}{iii} lines are present in the\nsynthetic CMFGEN spectra (e.g.\\ \\ion{O}{iii} $\\lambda\\lambda$\\,\n4368, 4396, 4448, 4454, and 4458), but they are barely visible in\nthe separated spectra. We checked that these lines are also absent\nfrom the original observed binary spectra. Their absence is thus by\nno means an artefact that is due to the treatment of our data.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig1}\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig3b_2}\n\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig4}\\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{fig5a}\n\\caption{Part of the normalized separated spectra of the primary (top, shifted\nupwards by 0.5 continuum units) and secondary stars (bottom), along\nwith the best-fit CMFGEN model spectra (red). \\label{fig1}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\caption{Stellar parameters of the primary and secondary stars as obtained\nwith CMFGEN \\label{CMFGENparam}}\n\n\n\\begin{centering}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{This study} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw})}\\tabularnewline\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & Prim.  & Sec.  & Prim.  & Sec.\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\hline \n$R$ (R$_{\\odot}$)  & $19.3\\pm2.2$  & $25.9\\pm3.4$  & $24.3\\pm0.7$  & $28.1\\pm0.7$\\tabularnewline\n$M$ (M$_{\\odot}$)  & $50.5\\pm20.1$  & $31.9\\pm9.5$  & $54.8\\pm4.6$  & $33.0\\pm2.8$\\tabularnewline\n$T_{{\\rm eff}}$ ($10^{4}$\\,K)  & $3.40\\pm0.15$  & $2.80\\pm0.15$  & $3.51\\pm0.1$  & $3.05\\pm0.04$\\tabularnewline\nlog ($\\frac{L}{L_{\\odot}}$)  & $5.63\\pm0.05$  & $5.58\\pm0.04$  & $5.90\\pm0.08$  & $5.78\\pm0.08$ \\tabularnewline\n$\\log{g}$ (cgs)  & $3.55\\pm0.15$  & $3.05\\pm0.15$  &  & \\tabularnewline\n$\\beta$  & 1.03 {\\scriptsize (f)}  & 1.08 {\\scriptsize (f)}  &  & \\tabularnewline\n$v_{\\infty}$ (km\\,s$^{-1}$)  & 2450 {\\scriptsize (f)}  & 2450 {\\scriptsize (f)}  &  & \\tabularnewline\n$\\dot{M}$ (M$_{\\odot}$\\,yr$^{-1})$  & $9.2\\times10^{-7}$ {\\scriptsize (f)}  & $3.3\\times10^{-7}$ {\\scriptsize (f)}  &  & \\tabularnewline\nBC  & $-3.17$  & $-2.67$  &  & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\tablefoot{The best-fit CMFGEN model parameters are compared with\nthe parameters obtained by Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw}) for an orbital\ninclination of 21\\textdegree{}.

First\nof all, we confirm the large overabundance of N in the secondary spectrum.\nSecond, we infer an asynchronous rotation of the two stars. The radii\ndetermined with CMFGEN (Table 4), the mean projected rotational velocities\n(Table 1), and the inclination estimate from Rauw et al.\\ (\\cite{Rauw})\nyield the rotation periods of the primary and secondary stars: 3.77\n$\\pm$ 0.32 days and 7.46 $\\pm$ 0.95 days, respectively, or a period\nratio of $0.50\\pm0.11$. We note that within the uncertainties on\nthe inclination, the secondary rotational period is similar to the\norbital period of the system (9.81 days).We return to these points\nin Sect.\\,\\ref{Conclusions}. Finally, we note that according to\nthe radii determined here, none of the stars currently fills its Roche\nlobe. With the formula of Eggleton (\\cite{Eggleton}), we estimate\na Roche-lobe volume filling factor of 15\\% for the primary and 73\\%\nfor the secondary.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nAs pointed out above, disentangling the \\textit{IUE} spectra of HD~149\\,404\nwas more problematic, especially for those parts of the UV spectra\nthat feature strong and broad wind lines and/or are polluted by blends\nwith numerous interstellar features. The left panel of Fig.\\,\\ref{fig2}\nillustrates the comparison of the separated spectra and the synthetic\nspectra obtained with CMFGEN over a wavelength range that is relatively\nfree of interstellar lines and mainly hosts photospheric lines. The\nagreement is clearly quite reasonable.\n\nTo check whether our CMFGEN models are also able to correctly reproduce\nthe wind features, we re-combined the synthetic CMFGEN UV spectra\nof the primary and secondary taking into account the radial velocity\nshifts at the time of the observations. We did so for several orbital\nphases. The right panel of Fig.\\,\\ref{fig2} illustrates the result\nfor three selected \\textit{IUE} spectra (SWP03008, JD~2\\,443\\,798.965,\nSWP02755, JD 2\\,443\\,776.869, and SWP54350, JD 2\\,449\\,817.595),\ncorresponding to conjunction phase 0.00 and quadrature phases 0.75\nand 0.25. The synthetic spectrum clearly agrees well with the observation,\nexcept for a few narrow absorptions that are due to the interstellar\nmedium, which are not taken into account in our model. This additionally\nsupports our determination of the physical parameters of the system\ncomponents. Moreover, the concordance between the synthetic and observed\nUV spectra suggests that the P-Cygni profiles form over parts of the\nstellar winds that are not significantly affected by the wind-wind\ninteractions, the latter leading to a loss of spherical symmetry of\nthe line formation region.\n\nThe fluxed CMFGEN spectra also allow us to estimate the brightness\nratio (primary/secondary) in the UV. We find a value of 0.91\n\\footnote{This result is at odds with the 0.7\\,magnitude difference (i.e.\\ primary/secondary\nbrightness ratio of 1.91) between the primary and secondary UV fluxes\ninferred by Howarth et al.\\ (\\cite{Howarth}). This situation most\nlikely stems from the differences in the spectral types adopted by\nHowarth et al.\\ (\\cite{Howarth}), who classified the system as O8.5\\,I\n+ O7\\,III, whilst we have derived O7.5\\,If + ON9.7\\,I. This difference\nin spectral types directly affects the strength of the cross-correlation\npeaks of the spectra of the two components with the template spectrum\nof $\\tau$~Sco (B0.2\\,IV) and thus the correction on the magnitude\ndifference inferred by Howarth et al. (\\cite{Howarth}).\n}.\n\nFurthermore, we found relatively little variability of the P-Cygni\nprofiles over the orbital period. Both observations (lack of strong\nvariability and little effect of wind interaction on the line morphology)\nare likely due to the low orbital inclination ($i\\sim21^{\\circ}$)\nof the system. This inclination implies that the observed spectrum\narises mostly at high stellar latitudes, where the wind-wind interaction\nzone has less influence on the wind structure.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{domaine3}}\\qquad{} \\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 176bp 570bp 575bp,clip]{binary_phi000}}\n\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 176bp 570bp 575bp,clip]{binary_phi025}}\\qquad{}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 176bp 570bp 575bp,clip,scale=1.5]{binary_phi075}}\n\\caption{Upper left panel: comparison between the separated \\textit{IUE} spectra\n(black) of the primary and secondary stars around the \\ion{He}{ii}\n$\\lambda$\\,1640 line and the corresponding synthetic spectra (red).\nThe primary spectrum is shifted upwards by 0.5 for clarity.

These properties indicate\na previous mass-exchange episode. Figure\\,\\ref{CNO} compares our\ninferred N/C and N/O ratios with the predictions for the evolution\nof single massive stars (Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ \\cite{Ekstrom}) either\nwithout rotation (left panel) or with a rotational velocity of $0.4\\times v_{crit}$\n(right panel). This figure clearly shows that for the spectroscopic\nmasses of the primary and secondary stars these models cannot account\nfor the observed CNO abundance patterns. For instance, in the case\nof models without rotation (left-hand panel of Fig.\\,\\ref{CNO}),\nno chemical enrichment is expected during the main-sequence evolution\nfor stars with mass $<60$\\,M$_{\\odot}$. Only for the M$\\,>60\\, M_{\\odot}$\nmodel is the loss of material through stellar wind sufficient to reveal\nthe products of the CNO cycle at the surface before the end of the\nmain-sequence evolution. Adopting instead the rotating models (right-hand\npanel of Fig.\\,\\ref{CNO}), the enrichment of the secondary can only\nbe explained by single-star evolution if we assume at least a star\nwith 60\\,M$_{\\odot}$ , whilst the spectroscopic mass is about a\nfactor two lower. When the surface abundances of a single star of\n60\\,M$_{\\odot}$ initial mass reach the values observed for the secondary\nof HD~149\\,404, the current mass of the star is still about 50\\,M$_{\\odot}$,\nthat is, it is\\ much higher than the mass determined for the secondary\nstar.\n\nThe observed CNO abundance pattern is qualitatively much easier to\ninterpret if the present-day secondary star was formerly the more\nmassive component of the binary and transferred mass and angular momentum\nto the present-day primary in an RLOF episode. During this process,\nthe outer envelope of the secondary was removed, revealing layers\nof material that were previously inside the convective hydrogen-burning\ncore (Vanbeveren \\cite{Vanbeveren1,Vanbeveren}).\n\nWe start by comparing our results with theoretical predictions from\nthe literature. The expectation is that the more mass has been lost\nby the donor, the deeper the layers that are revealed at the surface\nand thus the higher the N/C ratio. The predicted CNO abundances for\nthe mass loser after a case B mass-transfer episode are $\\left[{\\rm N/C}\\right]=100\\,\\left[{\\rm N/C}\\right]_{\\odot}$\nand $\\left[{\\rm N/O}\\right]\\geq5\\,\\left[{\\rm N/O}\\right]_{\\odot}$\n(Vanbeveren \\cite{Vanbeveren1}). This is indeed close to what we\nobserve in our analysis. Moreover, the RLOF scenario is re-enforced\nby the values of the primary star abundances. Classical radiative\nequilibrium evolutionary models predict normal H and He abundances\nfor the mass gainer of an RLOF episode, but an N abundance of two\nto three times solar (Vanbeveren \\& de Loore \\cite{VdL}), which agrees\nwith our results.\n\nThere are some caveats here, however. First, the results of Vanbeveren\n(\\cite{Vanbeveren1}) apply to case B mass transfer, whereas HD~149\\,404\nis more likely to have undergone a case A mass exchange (see below).\nSecond, when the outer hydrogen-rich layers are removed, an enrichment\nof the stellar surface of the mass donor in helium is expected. Our\nspectral modelling was made with the He abundance set to solar, however,\nand there is no hint for our models requiring a He enhancement in\nany of the stars. Although the predicted relative change of helium\nsurface abundance is usually much smaller than for N, this result\nis nonetheless surprising, especially in view of the large N overabundance\nof the secondary star.\n\nTo illustrate the helium enrichment that might be expected, we consider\nonce more the single-star evolutionary tracks with rotation of Ekstr\u00f6m\net al.\\ (\\cite{Ekstrom}). In these models, a nitrogen surface abundance\nsimilar to the one observed for the secondary is always accompanied\nby an increase of the surface helium abundance to values higher than\n$y=0.35$ by mass. The fact that the spectrum of the secondary of\nHD~149\\,404 can be fit with a solar helium abundance ($y=0.1$)\nsuggests that the internal structure of the secondary before the onset\nof mass transfer must have been different from that expected from\nsingle-star evolutionary models. Moreover, the RLOF in HD~149\\,404\nmust have come to a (temporary) stop before the full hydrogen-rich\nenvelope of the mass donor was removed. The latter conclusion is also\nsupported by our finding that both stars are currently well inside\ntheir Roche lobes.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=0bp 170bp 584bp 705bp,clip]{HD149404CNOrot0}}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=0bp 170bp 584bp 705bp,clip]{HD149404CNOrot}}\n\\caption{Comparison of the N/C and N/O ratios determined from our spectral\nanalyses with predictions from single-star evolutionary models of\ndifferent masses (Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ \\cite{Ekstrom}).

Conservative RLOF will increase the period of the binary.\nIf we assume a fully conservative mass transfer and apply the formula\nof Vanbeveren et al.\\ (\\cite{VDLVR}), we find that the orbital period\nwould have increased by 17\\% at most, the shortest possible initial\norbital period being 8.4\\,days for a mass exchange of 9.3\\,M$_{\\odot}$.\nHowever, Petrovic et al.\\ (\\cite{Petrovic}) argued that in fast\ncase A RLOF, only about 15 -- 20\\% of the mass shed by the mass donor\nis indeed accreted by its companion. If the mass-transfer efficiency\nis that low, then the secondary must have lost a much larger amount\nof mass. Such a non-conservative mass transfer can result from the\ntransfer of angular momentum. In fact, the mass gainer can be spun\nup to critical rotation and will then repel additional mass (and angular\nmomentum), leading to a non-conservative mass transfer (e.g.\\ Langer\net al.\\ \\cite{Langer}, Vanbeveren \\cite{Vanbeveren}, Langer \\cite{Langer1}).\nIn the previous section, we noted that the components of the system\nare apparently not in synchronous rotation. This asynchronicity therefore\nalso suggests the existence of a past mass and angular momentum transfer\nepisode, with a clear spin up of the primary star. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn Fig.\\,\\ref{HRD} we present the positions of the primary and secondary\nstars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) (upper panels) and\nin the log\\,g-log\\,$T_{{\\rm eff}}$ diagram (lower panels), along\nwith the evolutionary tracks from Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ (\\cite{Ekstrom})\nfor the core-hydrogen burning phase of single stars at solar metallicity,\nboth for non-rotating (left panels) and rotating (right panels) stars.\nThis figure again illustrates the failure of single-star evolutionary\ntracks to account for the properties of the components of HD~149\\,404.\nIf we consider the models without rotational mixing, the position\nof the primary star in the HRD is relatively close to the track corresponding\nto its present-day spectroscopic mass. However, the secondary appears\ntoo luminous for its present-day mass compared to these evolutionary\ntracks. If we compare the stars to the 40\\% critical rotation case,\nwe find that the primary's luminosity is below that expected for its\npresent-day spectroscopic mass. Moreover, the secondary lies outside\nthe range covered by tracks in the core-hydrogen burning phase. If\nwe consider the non-rotating case, we see that in the log\\,g-log\\,$T_{{\\rm eff}}$\ndiagram the primary star has a lower effective temperature and a higher\nsurface gravity than expected for a 50 M$_{\\odot}$ star, whilst the\nsecondary star displays parameters corresponding to stars twice as\nmassive as its present-day spectroscopic mass. For stars rotating\nat 40\\% of their critical velocity, we find that both stars would\nhave initial masses of about 30 M$_{\\odot}$. The primary dynamical\nmass is about a factor 2 higher, while for the secondary the agreement\nis good. Finally, in all cases (with and without rotation and for\nboth diagrams), the two components of HD~149\\,404 are not located\non the same isochrone, although they would be expected to have the\nsame age\n\\footnote{The age of the Ara\\,OB1 association of which HD~149\\,404 is a member\nwas estimated in the literature as $\\sim3$ Myr (Wolk et al.\\ \\cite{Wolk}).\n}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=40bp 175bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404hrdrot0_2}}\\enskip{}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=40bp 175bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404hrdrot_2}}\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 178bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404gTrot0}}\\enskip{}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[bb=38bp 178bp 580bp 711bp,clip]{HD149404gTrot}}\n\n\\caption{Position of the primary (open square) and secondary (filled square)\nstars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (upper panels) and the log\\,g-log\\,$T_{{\\rm eff}}$\ndiagram (lower panels) along with evolutionary tracks for single massive\nstars at solar metallicity during the core-hydrogen burning phase\n(Ekstr\u00f6m et al.\\ \\cite{Ekstrom}).

For\ninstance, spinning-up the mass gainer can lead to almost complete\nmixing of the latter. In this situation, models predict that He would\nbe enhanced in the atmosphere of the mass gainer and that the latter\nwould become bluer and overluminous for its mass (Vanbeveren \\& de\nLoore \\cite{VdL}). If there is no strong spin-up and the accretion\noccurs rather slowly and is accompanied by a fast diffusion process,\nthen the location of the gainer in the HRD should be very close to\nthat of a normal star of the same mass and chemical composition (Vanbeveren\net al.\\ \\cite{VDLVR}). The star is rejuvenated, however: it lies\non an isochrone that corresponds to a younger age than its actual\nage. The location of the primary in the HRD suggests that in the present\ncase the second scenario is likely to apply with a very moderate rejuvenation,\nif any, of the primary. This conclusion is supported by the lack of\na strong He enrichment, but it is at odds with the highly non-synchronous\nrotation of the primary reported above.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Comparison with other post-RLOF systems}\n\nIn this section, we briefly compare the properties of HD~149\\,404\nwith those of two other O-type binaries, Plaskett's Star and LZ\\,Cephei,\nwhich are probably in a post-case A RLOF evolutionary stage and have\nbeen analysed in a way similar to the present work (Linder et al.\\ \\cite{Linder},\nMahy et al.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}).\\\\\n\n\nPlaskett's Star (HD~47\\,129) is an O8\\,III/I + O7.5\\,III binary\nwith an orbital period of 14.4\\,days, slightly longer than that of\nHD~149\\,404, and a mass ratio near unity. Two observational facts\nsuggest that the initially more massive primary has undergone a case\nA RLOF episode in the past (Linder et al.\\ \\cite{Linder}). First,\nthe projected rotational velocity of the secondary star is remarkably\nhigh (mean value of $272.5\\pm35.0$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$) compared to\nthat of the primary (mean value of $65.7\\pm6.3$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$).\nThis strongly asynchronous rotation likely stems from a spin-up of\nthe secondary star through a recent transfer of angular momentum from\nthe primary star. Second, the primary star displays nitrogen overabundance\n(N/N$_{\\odot}=16.6\\pm5.0$) and carbon depletion (C/C$_{\\odot}=0.2\\pm0.1$),\nas is typical of an advanced evolutionary stage, whilst no such nitrogen\nenrichment is seen in the secondary spectrum\n\\footnote{The apparent N underabundance of the secondary inferred by Linder\net al.\\ (\\cite{Linder}) could be an artefact that is due to the\nrelatively shallow nitrogen lines of the secondary being washed out\nby its fast rotation and the difficulties of properly normalizing\nechelle spectra with such broad and shallow features (see also Fig.\\,1\nof Palate \\& Rauw \\cite{PR}).\n}. Given the present-day configuration of HD~47\\,129, it seems that\nthe transfer of angular momentum and the resulting spin-up of the\nmass gainer (the secondary in this case) might have prevented accretion\nof a larger portion of the primary's mass.\\\\\n\n\nLZ\\,Cephei (HD~209\\,481) is an O9\\,III + ON9.7\\,V binary with\na short orbital period of 3.07\\,days (Kameswara Rao \\cite{Rao})\nand a mass ratio (primary/secondary) of 2.53 (Mahy et al.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}).\nBoth components of LZ\\,Cep almost fill their Roche lobe (Mahy et\nal.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}, Palate et al.\\ \\cite{PRM}). Mahy et al.\\ (\\cite{Mahy1})\nfound that the secondary displays a strong nitrogen enrichment (18\ntimes solar), carbon and oxygen depletion (0.1 times solar), and a\nhigh helium content (4 times solar), suggesting a very advanced state\nof evolution. On the other hand, the primary displays only slightly\naltered surface abundances consistent with single-star evolution.\nThis suggests that the mass transfer was strongly non-conservative.\nMahy et al.\\ (\\cite{Mahy1}) noted a slight asynchronicity of the\nrotation periods of the order of 10-20 \\%, but concluded that the\nsystem is probably on the verge of achieving synchronization. Comparison\nwith single-star evolutionary tracks indicates a similar age discrepancy\nas we have found here for HD~149\\,404. The evolutionary masses ($25.3_{-4.0}^{+6.2}$\nand $18.0_{-2.5}^{+2.4}$\\,M$_{\\odot}$, for the primary and secondary\nrespectively) are significantly higher than their dynamical masses\n($16.9\\pm1.0$ and $6.7\\pm1.0$ M$_{\\odot}$ respectively, Mahy et\nal.\\ \\cite{Mahy1}, Palate et al.\\ \\cite{PRM}).\\\\\n\n\nAlthough our sample is currently too limited to draw firm conclusions,\nthe above comparison reveals several interesting results that are\nworth studying in more detail with a larger sample. First, we note\nthat in all three systems, the components appear either over- or under-luminous\nwhen compared with single-star evolutionary tracks corresponding to\ntheir present-day masses. During its initial phases, case A mass transfer\noccurs on a thermal timescale leading to a very rapid mass exchange.\nHowever, the mass transfer subsequently slows down and occurs on a\nnuclear timescale instead. By the time the mass transfer ends, both\nstars would therefore be expected to be in thermal equilibrium again.\nSince all three systems under consideration are in a detached configuration,\nthe stars should thus have settled onto their new post-RLOF evolutionary\ntracks. The discrepancy between the observed luminosities and those\npredicted by the single-star evolutionary tracks most likely stems\nfrom several effects, such as observational uncertainties, altered\nchemical compositions (and hence opacities of the stellar material),\nand a rotational velocity history that differs from that assumed in\nthe single-star models.\n\nOur comparison shows that the degree of asynchronicity in the three\npost-RLOF systems increases with orbital period (from LZ\\,Cep, over\nHD~149\\,404 to HD~47\\,129). This is most probably due to the higher\nefficiency of the tidal forcing in shorter period systems, or it might\nbe seen as evidence that momentum transfer has played a larger role\nin those systems that have a wider present-day orbital separation.\nThis is expected since binary evolution models predict spin-up to\nbe less efficient in closer systems because in such systems the accretion\nstream directly affects the mass gainer without forming an accretion\ndisk (e.g.\\ Langer \\cite{Langer1}). The questions of synchronization\nand circularization in close binary systems with early-type stars,\nfeaturing radiative envelopes and convective cores, have been addressed\nby Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1}) and Tassoul (\\cite{Tassoul}). Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1})\nconsidered radiative damping of the dynamical tide in the outer layers\nof the stellar envelopes as the main mechanism for synchronization.\nThe corresponding synchronization timescales strongly depend upon\nthe tidal torque constant $E_{2}$ , which varies by several orders\nof magnitude during the main-sequence lifetime of the star (Zahn \\cite{Zahn2}).\nSiess et al.\\ (\\cite{Siess}) provided a parametrization of this\nparameter as a function of stellar mass and relative age of the star.\nAssuming that their formalism holds for the masses of the stars considered\nhere and adopting an age of half the main-sequence age of the stars,\nwe estimated the values of $E_{2}$. We then evaluated the synchronization\ntimes following Eq. 4.28 of Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1}) by means of moments\nof inertia tabulated by Claret \\& Gim\u00e9nez (\\cite{CG}). The results\nare $5.6\\times10^{5}$ and $1.4\\times10^{4}$\\,years for the primary\nand secondary stars of HD~149\\,404, respectively, $4.4\\times10^{6}$\nand $27.6\\times10^{6}$\\,years for the primary and secondary of Plaskett's\nstar, and $2.8\\times10^{4}$ and $2.5\\times10^{4}$\\,years for the\nprimary and secondary components of LZ~Cephei. Tassoul (\\cite{Tassoul}),\non the other hand, proposed that the most effective mechanism for\nsynchronization is provided by large-scale hydrodynamic motions in\nthe interiors of the tidally distorted binary components. The resulting\ntimescales are considerably shorter than those estimated following\nthe formalism of Zahn (\\cite{Zahn1}). We estimate synchronization\ntimescales of $2.1\\times10^{4}$ and $3.2\\times10^{3}$\\,years for\nHD~149\\,404, $7.2\\times10^{4}$ and $2.0\\times10^{5}$\\,years for\nPlaskett's star, and $1.6\\times10^{3}$ and $6\\times10^{2}$\\,years\nfor LZ~Cep. Regardless of which of the two formalisms is most appropriate\nto describe the evolution of rotation in the systems considered here,\nwe find that, except perhaps for Plaskett's Star, which has a longer\nsynchronization timescale, the RLOF phase probably must have ended\nless than a few $10^{4}$\\,years ago. \n\n\nAnother puzzling result is the fact that the post-RLOF mass-ratio\ndeviates most from unity for the shortest period system (LZ\\,Cep).\nTherefore, in this system, the RLOF must have been comparatively more\nefficient than in the longer period systems. As discussed above, the\nmass transfer in LZ\\,Cep was most likely highly non-conservative.\nIf the material lost by the system does not carry away angular momentum\nin addition to the intrinsic orbital angular momentum, such a non-conservative\nmass loss leads to a widening of the orbital separation $a$ given\nby\n\n\\begin{center}\n", "index": 7, "text": "\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}=-\\frac{\\dot{M}}{M,}\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}=-\\frac{\\dot{M}}{M,}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>a</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mi>a</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>M</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>,</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
