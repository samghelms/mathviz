This often leads to wrong dominant wavelength estimates as it\n   is strongly dependent on the initial central density.\n   We argue that non-linear effects also play an important role on\n   the evolution of the fragmentation.\n   Once the density perturbation grows above the critical line-mass,\n   non-linearity leads to an enhancement of the central core density in\n   comparison to the analytical prediction.\n   Choosing the correct initial conditions with perturbation strengths\n   of around 20\\%, leads to inclination corrected line-of-sight velocities\n   and central core densities within the observational measurement error\n   in a realistic evolution time.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\n  stars:formation -- ISM:kinematics and dynamics -- ISM:structure\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\n   Individual or binary stars are formed in dense cores\n   \\citep{benson1989,difrancesco2007} which are condensations within larger\n   molecular cloud complexes.\n   The critical process of how a tens of parsec sized cloud fragments\n   into a few $0.1 \\text{ pc}$ sized cores nevertheless remains an unresolved\n   challenge for star formation. Especially, as core formation appears to be\n   tied to the low efficiency of the star-formation process \\citep{evans2009}.\n\n   The recent large-scale cloud images taken by the \\textit{Herschel} Space\n   Observatory show that molecular clouds exhibit a ubiquity of complex\n   filamentary structures, forming a network over several size scales\n   \\citep{andre2010,molinari2010,arzoumanian2011,schneider2012} and dense \n   cores being aligned with\n   large-scale filaments like pearls in a string. This is a strong\n   indication that core formation is tied to some kind of\n   filament fragmentation process, a connection which has long been proposed\n   \\citep{schneider1979,larson1985}.\n\n   Recent observations however have shown that filamentary clouds with\n   trans-sonic internal motions are not one single entity, but consist of\n   fibers: velocity-coherent structures of subsonic gas\n   \\citep{hacar2013, arzoumanian2013, tanaka2013, tafalla2015}. The existence\n   of filamentary substructure has also been found recently in numerical\n   simulations \\citep{moeckel2015, smith2016}. Dense cores are embedded within\n   these fibers and often show similar kinematic properties with a smooth\n   transition from fiber to core gas. This suggests that turbulence does not\n   dissipate at the scale of dense cores, but at the typical scale of the\n   velocity-coherent fibers of about $0.5 \\text{ pc}$. \\citet{tafalla2015}\n   propose a model they call \"\\textit{fray and fragment}\":\n   At first, the filament forms through a colliding flow. Over time, residual\n   turbulent motions together with gravity form velocity-coherent fibers.\n   Finally, some of the fibers form dense cores through gravitational\n   instability. The model suggests that cores form by subsonic motions and gives\n   rise to the question of the exact mechanism that leads to core formation in\n   fibres and filaments. The key to understanding the core fragmentation process\n   and to distinguish between different models, such as a pure gravitational\n   fragmentation, dissipation of turbulence due to supersonic shocks\n   \\citep{padoan2001, klessen2005, vazquez-semadeni2005} or the loss of magnetic\n   support due to ambipolar diffusion \\citep{shu1987}, is the internal\n   velocity structure of the filaments, as well as their kinematic properties.\n\n   A detailed study of the L1517 dark cloud in Taurus and its core population\n   was presented by \\citet{hacar2011}. They observed the cloud in four\n   different transitions, ranging from $\\text{N}_2\\text{H}^+(J=1-0)$ and\n   SO$(J_N=3_2-2_1)$ to $\\text{C}^{18}\\text{O}(J=1-0)$ and\n   $\\text{C}^{17}\\text{O}(J=1-0)$ as well as in dust emission.\n   This allows them to study different density regimes, from the less dense\n   filament gas to the very dense core interior, in great detail. In addition\n   they show that the cores are in different evolutionary states, with more\n   evolved cores having increasing N$_2$H$^+$ abundance and anti-correlated,\n   depleted SO emission \\citep{tafalla2006}. The region is made up of four\n   velocity coherent filaments, consisting predominantly of subsonic gas. Two\n   of the filaments present two separate forming cores and their interior\n   motion shows a smooth transition to the core gas kinematics. There is every\n   indication that the cores form by contraction of the filament gas due to\n   observing an oscillatory motion in the line-of-sight velocity centroid with\n   a periodicity that matches that of the cores and is clearly associated with\n   the core positions as is expected from the gravitational instability model.\n   Nevertheless, the authors claim that the fragmentation distance is not\n   consistent with the model of pure gravitational fragmentation, a claim we\n   want to test using numerical methods as the model is strongly dependent on\n   its initial condition and the inclination of the filament.\n\n   In the following sections, we recapitulate the filament and core\n   population of L1517 (\\autoref{sec:L1517population}) and the characteristic\n   properties our models have to replicate. We also summarize the theory of the\n   fragmentation of pressure-bound isothermal filaments (\\autoref{sec:theory}),\n   the basis of our models and how we use it in our simulations\n   (\\autoref{sec:prediction}). Next, we discuss the simulation set-up\n   (\\autoref{sec:simulationsetup}) and present our numerical results\n   (\\autoref{sec:simulations}). We start by comparing our data to the\n   observations (\\autoref{sec:observations}), then we discuss the evolution of\n   the core growth in the linear and non-linear regime (\\autoref{sec:evolution}).\n   Finally, we finish with an analysis of the external pressure in the dark cloud\n   (\\autoref{sec:externalpressure}) which is a crucial part of the model of a\n   pressure-bound isothermal filament.\n\n\\section{Filaments and cores in L1517}\n\\label{sec:L1517population}\n\n   The L1517 dark cloud has several properties in favour of an idealized\n   analysis. The cloud is relatively isolated, only to be disturbed\n   by the near PMS stars AB Aurigae and SU Aurigae, which are\n   physically associated with L1517 and are heating the near-by gas\n   \\citep{nachman1979,duvert1986,heyer1987}, although no influence on the\n   dense gas can be seen. Furthermore, the filament gas is predominantly\n   subsonic. Thus, turbulence only plays a minor role in the dynamics of\n   the gas.\n\n   The density profiles of three of the four\n   filaments can be reproduced by an isothermal cylinder in\n   pressure equilibrium with its self-gravity.

We find that the higher velocity dispersion inside the cores is\n   not only due to the radial collapse of the filament but is dominated by the\n   infall of gas coming from the bulk of the filament. It is interesting to\n   note that, although we do not model subsonic turbulence, the ordered motions\n   inside the filament already lead to a considerable amount of non-thermal\n   velocity dispersion.

Each perturbation of every variable should follow\n   \\autoref{eq:perturbation}. Thus, they should follow a linear\n   evolution in log-space. This is shown for the central maximum density\n   and central maximum velocity in the filament axis in\n   \\autoref{fig:filament1evolution} for filament 1 and in\n   \\autoref{fig:filament2evolution} for filament 2. In order to stay close\n   to a reasonable limit of 1 Myr (see previous subsection), we start the\n   evolution of filament 1 at about 10\\% perturbation strength and of filament\n   2 at about 20\\%. Both the maximum density and maximum velocity follow the\n   linear prediction for the majority of the evolution with the density showing\n   some oscillation around the linear prediction. In the late phase of the\n   evolution, both filaments show a clear non-linear growth of the maximum\n   density. It is worth noting that this non-linear phase is not short in the\n   sense that all the mass of the filament collapses into a core in a fast\n   period of time, but it is a smooth process, which can easily take up to\n   0.4 Myr or nearly half of the whole formation time of a core and still\n   leaves diffuse gas to make up the filament. Also note that the velocity\n   does not follow the same non-linear evolution initially. Only when we let\n   the simulations run further, we see that the velocity follows with a delay\n   of about 0.3 Myr. At that point in time, the cores are in a much more\n   developed state and the simulations brake down due to resolution issues.\n\n   In order to have a deeper look into the non-linear phase we look at the\n   line-mass in the slice of the maximum density.

Each perturbation of every variable should follow\n   \\autoref{eq:perturbation}. Thus, they should follow a linear\n   evolution in log-space. This is shown for the central maximum density\n   and central maximum velocity in the filament axis in\n   \\autoref{fig:filament1evolution} for filament 1 and in\n   \\autoref{fig:filament2evolution} for filament 2. In order to stay close\n   to a reasonable limit of 1 Myr (see previous subsection), we start the\n   evolution of filament 1 at about 10\\% perturbation strength and of filament\n   2 at about 20\\%. Both the maximum density and maximum velocity follow the\n   linear prediction for the majority of the evolution with the density showing\n   some oscillation around the linear prediction. In the late phase of the\n   evolution, both filaments show a clear non-linear growth of the maximum\n   density. It is worth noting that this non-linear phase is not short in the\n   sense that all the mass of the filament collapses into a core in a fast\n   period of time, but it is a smooth process, which can easily take up to\n   0.4 Myr or nearly half of the whole formation time of a core and still\n   leaves diffuse gas to make up the filament. Also note that the velocity\n   does not follow the same non-linear evolution initially. Only when we let\n   the simulations run further, we see that the velocity follows with a delay\n   of about 0.3 Myr. At that point in time, the cores are in a much more\n   developed state and the simulations brake down due to resolution issues.\n\n   In order to have a deeper look into the non-linear phase we look at the\n   line-mass in the slice of the maximum density.

This indicates that the reason for the\n   non-linear evolution of the maximum central density is that the region\n   containing the cores are supercritical in the line-mass. This leads to a\n   radial collapse of the filament at the position of the core as it cannot\n   sustain hydrodynamical equilibrium which in turn enhances the central density.\n\n   \\begin{figure}\n      \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{./fcylevolution.pdf}\n      \\caption{Evolution of the maximum density perturbation in log-space\n      (blue, left axis, logarithmic scale) of filament 2 together with the\n      evolution of $f_\\text{cyl}$ (violet, right axis, linear scale) in the\n      maximum density filament slice.

This means the maximum\n      density evolution is driven primarily by the radial collapse of the\n      filament in this section.}\n      \\label{fig:fcylevolution}\n   \\end{figure}\n\n   This effect can account for the majority of the asymmetry but we also\n   observe a reduced growth of the perturbation of the density minimum.

As radial\n   collapse of the filament would not lead to a difference in line-mass,\n   this indicates that the density growth is not fed by radial collapse alone.\n\n   \\begin{figure}\n      \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{./fcylminimum.pdf}\n      \\caption{Evolution of the maximum and absolute minimum value of the\n      density perturbation (left axis) of filament 2 together with the\n      evolution of the absolute value of the perturbation in $f_\\text{cyl}$\n      (right axis) in the respective filament slice. The minimum density\n      perturbation evolves slower as predicted, growing even slower as time\n      progresses. This means that the cores are not feeded symmetrically\n      by the density minima, but accrete mass from over the whole filament.}\n      \\label{fig:fcylminimum}\n   \\end{figure}\n\n   An interesting effect is that the evolution of the minimum density,\n   as well as the minimum line-mass, flattens as the perturbation of the\n   maximum becomes non-linear. This implies that the mass is not\n   redistributed from the minimum to the maximum anymore\n   but that the cores accrete mass from\n   all over the bulk of the filament, which can be seen in the central\n   volume density of filament 2 in \\autoref{fig:filament2lineofsight}.\n   The area between the cores shows a flat decreased density,\n   with the cores being very pronounced and peaked, indicating that the\n   cores also pull in mass from the filament axis. This means that as we\n   approach the supercritical state of the cores, the accretion changes\n   from a simple linear enhancement and reduction of the maximum and minimum\n   respectively to a radial, spherical symmetric accretion onto the cores.\n   This effect has also been shown and studied by \\citet{inutsuka1992} in\n   SPH-simulations where they see the same behavior in the non-linear phase.\n\n   The change from linear to non-linear evolution also leads to a\n   difference in core morphology and has an important implication for\n   observed cores. This change can be seen in \\autoref{fig:filamentcontour}\n   where the density contours show the cores initially forming to have a\n   prolate shape, as matter is only transfered from the minimum to the maximum\n   density. This changes drastically in the non-linear phase at the end of the\n   simulation where the dense cores clearly show a generally round form in the\n   density distribution. This was also seen in the simulations of\n   \\citet{inutsuka1992} where the cores approached a near spherical form for\n   late times in the non-linear phase. If one were to observe a dense core that\n   displays an elongated, prolate form, it could be a strong hint that it is\n   situated in the linear evolutionary phase. Indeed, observed cores typically\n   show an elongated form \\citep{benson1989} which is consistent with the fact\n   that cores spend the bigger part of their lifetime in the linear evolutionary\n   phase. However, it is obvious that there is an observational bias to detect\n   dense cores which are likely to be in the non-linear phase already as they\n   would not easily stand out of the filament gas otherwise. For instance,\n   at the beginning of the non-linear phase of the simulation of filament 2\n   the cores only have an over-density of a factor of about two with respect\n   to the filament gas.\n\n   The factor of two difference in the initial perturbation of the density\n   maximum and the density minimum in \\autoref{fig:fcylminimum} stems from the\n   fact that we start the simulation at an even earlier time with a very small\n   perturbation strength in order to let the filament adjust to the perturbation.\n   Although it is a relatively small difference, it highlights the fact that\n   the density minimum already evolved slower than the density maximum. Starting\n   with different values for the initial perturbation strength shows that the\n   factor of two is robust and seems to be hard to avoid. Nevertheless, it is\n   of relatively minor impact, since a factor two is also the inherent error\n   in the observation and would not lead to an offset of the mean density as\n   initial condition.\n\n\\subsection{External pressure}\n\\label{sec:externalpressure}\n\n   From \\autoref{eq:rhoboundary}, it is possible to determine the boundary\n   density of the filaments. This value can then be used in\n   \\autoref{eq:boundarypressure} to get an estimate of the pressure of the\n   surrounding material. Using our derived values of\n   $\\rho_0=8.18 \\cdot 10^{-20} \\text{{\\,g cm$^{-3}$}}$ and $f_\\text{cyl}=0.51$ for\n   filament 1 and $\\rho_0=6.12 \\cdot 10^{-20} \\text{{\\,g cm$^{-3}$}}$ and\n   $f_\\text{cyl}=0.43$ for filament 2, both filaments give nearly the exact same \n   value for the external pressure of\n   $P_\\text{ext}/k_B = 5.01 \\cdot 10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$ and\n   $P_\\text{ext}/k_B = 5.08 \\cdot 10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$ where $k_B$ is the\n   Boltzmann constant. The consistency of both values\n   could be a coincidence, but is reassuring and shows the power of the\n   pressure truncated filament method to predict the environmental\n   pressure.\n\n   However, the source of the external pressure is not clear and is open to\n   debate. It is larger than the usually assumed total (thermal + turbulent)\n   gas pressure of the interstellar medium, which is estimated to be of the\n   order of $P_\\text{ISM}/k_B \\approx 10^3-10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$, e.g. by\n   \\citet{bertoldi1992}, although they also estimate the gravitational\n   pressure of the weight of the overlying material of different molecular\n   clouds on cores and get values in a range of\n   $P_G/k_B \\approx 10^4-10^5 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$. While this pressure is more\n   important in quiescent clouds and not necessarily as high for turbulent\n   clouds, gravitational pressure can add to the overall external pressure.\n\n   In addition, warm ionized gas can also lead to a supportive pressure, as has\n   been shown for the Pipe Nebula \\citep{gritschneder2012}. They also\n   determine pressure values in the range of\n   $P_\\text{ion}/k_B \\approx 10^4-10^5 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$. A possible source\n   for ionizing radiation is AB Aurigae, which has been shown to heat the\n   diffuse gas component while having nearly no influence on the dense gas\n   \\citep{duvert1986,ladd1991}. However, for the estimated environmental\n   densities of order $5 \\cdot 10^2 \\text{ cm}^{-3}$ we would require a\n   temperature of around 100 K which is not observed in the external medium.\n\n   Another source of external pressure is turbulent\n   ram pressure $P_\\text{ram} = \\rho\\sigma_\\text{turb}^2$ where\n   $\\sigma_\\text{turb}$ is calculated according to \\autoref{eq:nonthermalsigma}.\n   The relevant velocity dispersion $\\sigma_\\text{turb}$ for an external ram\n   pressure is not the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the filaments but\n   that of the whole region. The observations of \\citet{hacar2011} show that\n   the C$^{18}$O gas is measured over the range of\n   $\\Delta v = 1.2 \\text{ km s}^{-1}$. Assuming an external density of\n   $\\rho_b \\sim 5 \\cdot 10^2 \\text{ cm}^{-3}$ leads to an external pressure\n   of about $P_\\text{ram}/k_B \\approx 4 \\cdot 10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$\n   which is in excellent agreement with our external pressure estimate.\n\n   Although the source of the external pressure still remains unclear, a good\n   candidate is therefore turbulent ram pressure. The theoretical model does not\n   allow for a big leeway in the external pressure estimate and further\n   observations are required to confirm this conjecture and determine the origin\n   of the external pressure.\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusions}\n\n   Even though we can reproduce the observational data well, some caveats remain.\n   First and foremost, we simulate an infinite filament by using periodic\n   boundary conditions. On the contrary, filaments have a finite length and it\n   has already been shown that filaments collapse globally via the end-dominated\n   mode where clumps form at both ends of the filament due to gravitational\n   focusing \\citep{bastien1983,burkert2004,pon2012}.

Thus, although fragmentation is\n   physically possible, the filament will also\n   change its form on a Myr scale. This will definitely influence\n   fragmentation length- and timescales and if it is not possible to find\n   other stabilizing processes, e.g. rotation or magnetic fields, this\n   effect has to be taken into account.\n\n   Furthermore, although we can explain the observed densities, some\n   differences to the observations remain. Most notably,\n   the cores in \\autoref{fig:filament1lineofsight} and\n   \\autoref{fig:filament2lineofsight} are more peaked than the observed\n   cores. Also the observed filaments have a diameter of about 0.2 pc in\n   contrast to our simulations where the filaments have a diameter of about\n   0.14 pc. The reason for this could be that we do not include the intrinsic\n   turbulence. \\citet{hacar2011} do find that a considerable amount of\n   sub-sonic turbulence of about 0.5 times the sound speed dominates the\n   filaments. This will naturally lead to puffed-up cores and a wider filament\n   itself. Turbulence could indeed also change the form of the filament\n   and fragmentation length- and timescales and is a factor to take into\n   account but as it does not change the line-mass that regulates the\n   fragmentation the impact should be relatively small. Still, a detailed\n   study on the effect of turbulence would be interesting in order to\n   understand better whether the fragmentation presented here is still\n   possible.\n\n   Additionally, the observed cores are not symmetrical. For an idealized analysis we\n   treat them as symmetric with a central density corresponding to their mean, but in\n   reality their central density differs up to a factor of about three for filament 2.\n   This could be either an effect of a clumpy or uneven initial mass distribution or\n   of an asymmetrical evolution out of an evenly mass-distributed idealized filament.\n   In an extended study, it should be possible to break their symmetrical evolution by\n   introducing a power spectrum on the initial perturbation instead of only using the\n   dominant wavelength.\n\n   Nevertheless, we have shown that the fragmentation length scale can indeed be\n   explained by subsonic gravitational fragmentation of the filament, assuming\n   an idealized model.

This is due\n   to the fact that the densest regions of a filament exceed the line-mass where a\n   radial hydrodynamic equilibrium is possible. This does not lead to an instant\n   radial collapse, but the cores accrete matter radially, as well as from the whole\n   filament. This makes them live long enough to be observed in the non-linear phase.\n\n   Most importantly, the change from linear to non-linear evolution is indicated in a\n   change of core morphology. While a symmetrical redistribution of material from the\n   minimum to maximum density leads to a prolate form, the radial collapse in all\n   directions of the cores in the non-linear phase makes the core roundish in\n   appearance. The high density contrasts from core to filament gas which are only\n   achieved in the non-linear evolution makes cores more likely to be observed in the\n   non-linear phase.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\n   We thank Matthias Gritschneder and the whole CAST group for helpful\n   comments and discussions.

This leads to a\n   radial collapse of the filament at the position of the core as it cannot\n   sustain hydrodynamical equilibrium which in turn enhances the central density.\n\n   \\begin{figure}\n      \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{./fcylevolution.pdf}\n      \\caption{Evolution of the maximum density perturbation in log-space\n      (blue, left axis, logarithmic scale) of filament 2 together with the\n      evolution of $f_\\text{cyl}$ (violet, right axis, linear scale) in the\n      maximum density filament slice. One can see that the non-linear\n      evolution of the maximum density is tied to the fact that the line-mass\n      enters the critical regime ($f_\\text{cyl}>1$). This means the maximum\n      density evolution is driven primarily by the radial collapse of the\n      filament in this section.}\n      \\label{fig:fcylevolution}\n   \\end{figure}\n\n   This effect can account for the majority of the asymmetry but we also\n   observe a reduced growth of the perturbation of the density minimum. In\n   \\autoref{fig:fcylminimum} we plot the evolution of the maximum and the\n   minimum density as well as the evolution of the maximum and minimum\n   line-mass, both on a logarithmic scale to show the linear evolution.\n   Note that, not only does the density follow the linear prediction\n   but also the line-mass as predicted by \\autoref{eq:fcylperturbation}.\n   One can also see the non-linear evolution of the maximum density in the\n   line-mass maximum but it does not grow as fast as the density. As radial\n   collapse of the filament would not lead to a difference in line-mass,\n   this indicates that the density growth is not fed by radial collapse alone.\n\n   \\begin{figure}\n      \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{./fcylminimum.pdf}\n      \\caption{Evolution of the maximum and absolute minimum value of the\n      density perturbation (left axis) of filament 2 together with the\n      evolution of the absolute value of the perturbation in $f_\\text{cyl}$\n      (right axis) in the respective filament slice. The minimum density\n      perturbation evolves slower as predicted, growing even slower as time\n      progresses. This means that the cores are not feeded symmetrically\n      by the density minima, but accrete mass from over the whole filament.}\n      \\label{fig:fcylminimum}\n   \\end{figure}\n\n   An interesting effect is that the evolution of the minimum density,\n   as well as the minimum line-mass, flattens as the perturbation of the\n   maximum becomes non-linear. This implies that the mass is not\n   redistributed from the minimum to the maximum anymore\n   but that the cores accrete mass from\n   all over the bulk of the filament, which can be seen in the central\n   volume density of filament 2 in \\autoref{fig:filament2lineofsight}.\n   The area between the cores shows a flat decreased density,\n   with the cores being very pronounced and peaked, indicating that the\n   cores also pull in mass from the filament axis. This means that as we\n   approach the supercritical state of the cores, the accretion changes\n   from a simple linear enhancement and reduction of the maximum and minimum\n   respectively to a radial, spherical symmetric accretion onto the cores.\n   This effect has also been shown and studied by \\citet{inutsuka1992} in\n   SPH-simulations where they see the same behavior in the non-linear phase.\n\n   The change from linear to non-linear evolution also leads to a\n   difference in core morphology and has an important implication for\n   observed cores. This change can be seen in \\autoref{fig:filamentcontour}\n   where the density contours show the cores initially forming to have a\n   prolate shape, as matter is only transfered from the minimum to the maximum\n   density. This changes drastically in the non-linear phase at the end of the\n   simulation where the dense cores clearly show a generally round form in the\n   density distribution. This was also seen in the simulations of\n   \\citet{inutsuka1992} where the cores approached a near spherical form for\n   late times in the non-linear phase. If one were to observe a dense core that\n   displays an elongated, prolate form, it could be a strong hint that it is\n   situated in the linear evolutionary phase. Indeed, observed cores typically\n   show an elongated form \\citep{benson1989} which is consistent with the fact\n   that cores spend the bigger part of their lifetime in the linear evolutionary\n   phase. However, it is obvious that there is an observational bias to detect\n   dense cores which are likely to be in the non-linear phase already as they\n   would not easily stand out of the filament gas otherwise. For instance,\n   at the beginning of the non-linear phase of the simulation of filament 2\n   the cores only have an over-density of a factor of about two with respect\n   to the filament gas.\n\n   The factor of two difference in the initial perturbation of the density\n   maximum and the density minimum in \\autoref{fig:fcylminimum} stems from the\n   fact that we start the simulation at an even earlier time with a very small\n   perturbation strength in order to let the filament adjust to the perturbation.\n   Although it is a relatively small difference, it highlights the fact that\n   the density minimum already evolved slower than the density maximum. Starting\n   with different values for the initial perturbation strength shows that the\n   factor of two is robust and seems to be hard to avoid. Nevertheless, it is\n   of relatively minor impact, since a factor two is also the inherent error\n   in the observation and would not lead to an offset of the mean density as\n   initial condition.\n\n\\subsection{External pressure}\n\\label{sec:externalpressure}\n\n   From \\autoref{eq:rhoboundary}, it is possible to determine the boundary\n   density of the filaments. This value can then be used in\n   \\autoref{eq:boundarypressure} to get an estimate of the pressure of the\n   surrounding material. Using our derived values of\n   $\\rho_0=8.18 \\cdot 10^{-20} \\text{{\\,g cm$^{-3}$}}$ and $f_\\text{cyl}=0.51$ for\n   filament 1 and $\\rho_0=6.12 \\cdot 10^{-20} \\text{{\\,g cm$^{-3}$}}$ and\n   $f_\\text{cyl}=0.43$ for filament 2, both filaments give nearly the exact same \n   value for the external pressure of\n   $P_\\text{ext}/k_B = 5.01 \\cdot 10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$ and\n   $P_\\text{ext}/k_B = 5.08 \\cdot 10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$ where $k_B$ is the\n   Boltzmann constant. The consistency of both values\n   could be a coincidence, but is reassuring and shows the power of the\n   pressure truncated filament method to predict the environmental\n   pressure.\n\n   However, the source of the external pressure is not clear and is open to\n   debate. It is larger than the usually assumed total (thermal + turbulent)\n   gas pressure of the interstellar medium, which is estimated to be of the\n   order of $P_\\text{ISM}/k_B \\approx 10^3-10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$, e.g. by\n   \\citet{bertoldi1992}, although they also estimate the gravitational\n   pressure of the weight of the overlying material of different molecular\n   clouds on cores and get values in a range of\n   $P_G/k_B \\approx 10^4-10^5 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$. While this pressure is more\n   important in quiescent clouds and not necessarily as high for turbulent\n   clouds, gravitational pressure can add to the overall external pressure.\n\n   In addition, warm ionized gas can also lead to a supportive pressure, as has\n   been shown for the Pipe Nebula \\citep{gritschneder2012}. They also\n   determine pressure values in the range of\n   $P_\\text{ion}/k_B \\approx 10^4-10^5 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$. A possible source\n   for ionizing radiation is AB Aurigae, which has been shown to heat the\n   diffuse gas component while having nearly no influence on the dense gas\n   \\citep{duvert1986,ladd1991}. However, for the estimated environmental\n   densities of order $5 \\cdot 10^2 \\text{ cm}^{-3}$ we would require a\n   temperature of around 100 K which is not observed in the external medium.\n\n   Another source of external pressure is turbulent\n   ram pressure $P_\\text{ram} = \\rho\\sigma_\\text{turb}^2$ where\n   $\\sigma_\\text{turb}$ is calculated according to \\autoref{eq:nonthermalsigma}.\n   The relevant velocity dispersion $\\sigma_\\text{turb}$ for an external ram\n   pressure is not the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the filaments but\n   that of the whole region. The observations of \\citet{hacar2011} show that\n   the C$^{18}$O gas is measured over the range of\n   $\\Delta v = 1.2 \\text{ km s}^{-1}$. Assuming an external density of\n   $\\rho_b \\sim 5 \\cdot 10^2 \\text{ cm}^{-3}$ leads to an external pressure\n   of about $P_\\text{ram}/k_B \\approx 4 \\cdot 10^4 \\text{{\\,K cm$^{-3}$}}$\n   which is in excellent agreement with our external pressure estimate.\n\n   Although the source of the external pressure still remains unclear, a good\n   candidate is therefore turbulent ram pressure. The theoretical model does not\n   allow for a big leeway in the external pressure estimate and further\n   observations are required to confirm this conjecture and determine the origin\n   of the external pressure.\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusions}\n\n   Even though we can reproduce the observational data well, some caveats remain.\n   First and foremost, we simulate an infinite filament by using periodic\n   boundary conditions. On the contrary, filaments have a finite length and it\n   has already been shown that filaments collapse globally via the end-dominated\n   mode where clumps form at both ends of the filament due to gravitational\n   focusing \\citep{bastien1983,burkert2004,pon2012}. It was shown by\n   \\citet{clarke2015} using semi-analytical methods and simulations that\n   the global timescale for collapse of filaments with greater aspect rations\n   than $A>2$ is:\n   \n", "index": 29, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n      t_\\text{col}= \\frac{0.49+0.25A}{\\sqrt{G\\frac{(M/L)}{\\pi R^2}}}\n   \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"t_{\\text{col}}=\\frac{0.49+0.25A}{\\sqrt{G\\frac{(M/L)}{\\pi R^{2}}}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mtext>col</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>0.49</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mn>0.25</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></mrow><msqrt><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>L</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow></msqrt></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
