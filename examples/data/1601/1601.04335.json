Potential applications for field-emission devices include  X-ray tubes \\cite{Hwan07a}, high-luminance light sources \\cite{Saito200230} and field-emission displays \\cite{Choi99a}. While most of the attention has been focused on field emission from carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, the field emission from carbon yarns, fibers and graphene flakes has also been reported.\n\nThe field emission properties of carbon materials depend on many experimental parameters. While, ideally, it is often expected that the current-voltage curves follow the Fowler-Nordheim theory \\cite{FN28a}, some publications report significant deviations from such an ideal response including a hysteresis in current-voltage characteristics \\cite{Lim01a,Park20052094,Sveningsson05a,Li08c,Okotrub09a,Chen11a,Cahay14a,Kleshch15a,popov2015comparison} and self-oscillations \\cite{Barois13a}. The origin of the hysteresis is typically associated with either adsorption/desorption processes \\cite{Lim01a,Park20052094,Li08c,Okotrub09a,Chen11a}, electrostatic alignment of some constituents of the system \\cite{Cahay14a,Kleshch15a}, or temperature effects \\cite{Sveningsson05a}. As of now, there is no common theory that would account for such dynamic processes in the field emission.\n\nThe purpose of the present article is to develop a link between hysteretic field-emission devices and a general class of memristive devices and systems (resistors with memory) \\cite{chua76a} (see Fig. \\ref{fig:fig1}(a)). This goal is approached both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, it is shown that the field emission from carbon nanotube arrays exhibits a frequency-dependent hysteresis in the form of pinched hysteresis loops, which are the most pronounced feature of memristive devices and systems \\cite{chua76a}. Theoretically, we introduce a general formalism of memristive systems and develop a specific theoretical model accounting for our experimental observations.\n\nWe note that memristive systems~\\cite{chua76a} are\nparticular types of memory circuit elements \\cite{diventra09a,diventra09b}.\nThere are two kinds of memristive systems: voltage-controlled and\ncurrent-controlled ones~\\cite{chua76a}. The voltage-controlled memristive\nsystems are defined by the equations\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nI(t) &=&R^{-1}\\left( x,U,t\\right) U(t),  \\label{eq1a} \\\\\n\\dot{x} &=&f\\left( x,U,t\\right) ,  \\label{eq2a}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $U(t)$ and $I(t)$ denote the voltage and current across the device, $R$\nis the memristance (memory resistance), $x=\\{x_{i}\\}$ is a set of $n$ state\nvariables describing the internal state of the system, and $f$ is an $n$\n-dimensional vector function. Current-controlled memristive systems are\ndefined in a similar way \\cite{chua76a}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.85\\textwidth]{fig1}\n\n\n\\caption{ \\textbf{(a)} CNT array field emission device comprises a memristive system. The CNT array is attached to the cathode (at the bottom) separated by a distance $d$ from the anode (at the top). The circuit symbol of memristor is shown to the right. As nonlinear resistors with memory (see Eq. (\\ref{eq1a}) definition), memristors are capable of describing strongly asymmetric (diode-like) response with memory of our  field-emission devices. \\textbf{(b)} SEM image showing the top surface of the CNT array field emission device.}\n\\label{fig:fig1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.85\\textwidth]{fig2}\n\n\n\\caption{\\textbf{(a)} Applied voltage and field emission current density as functions of time.\n\\textbf{(b)} Current-voltage characteristics of field emission at different frequencies of the input signal.}\n\\label{fig:fig2}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe importance of Eqs. (\\ref{eq1a}) and (\\ref{eq2a}) lies with the fact that\nthey represent a unified framework to describe various memristive\ndevices \\cite{pershin11a}. Using these equations, one can abstract from\nspecific details of device realization, thus describing devices based on\ndifferent physical principles \\cite{pershin11a} on the same foot \\cite\n{diventra11a}. Therefore, it is not surprising that many unlike memristive\ndevices share several features \\cite{chua76a}. The best known is\nthe hysteresis, which is most pronounced at frequencies of the applied\nvoltage that are comparable to those of internal processes leading to\nmemory. At much higher frequencies and sometimes at much lower frequencies,\nthe hysteresis is significantly reduced.\n\nIn the following part of this article, the hysteretic behavior of field\nemission from CNT arrays is explored experimentally, focusing precisely on\nhow the frequency of the applied input affects the hysteresis in\ncurrent-voltage response.\n\n\\section{Experimental details and results}\n\nThe method of fabrication of CNT\narrays is similar to the one in Ref.~[\\citeonline{fedoseeva2015field}]. Our CVD\nreactor consists of a quartz tube (5 cm in diameter) placed inside a\nhigh-temperature furnace. The precision of regulation for the furnace temperature\nis about 0.1$^{\\circ }$C. Vertically aligned CNT arrays were grown by an\naerosol-assisted catalytic chemical vapor deposition on Si (100) substrates\nwith lateral dimensions of $10\\times 10$ mm$^{2}$. A reaction mixture (2\\%\nof ferrocene (Fe(C$_{5}$H$_{5}$)$_{2}$) in toluene (C$_{6}$H$_{5}$CH$_{3}$))\nwas dispersed via an injector located in $\\sim 200^{\\circ }$C zone at a rate\nof 15 ml/hour. High purity Ar at atmospheric pressure was used to transport the\nvaporized reaction mixture to the synthesis zone (the central part of the\nquartz tube). The pyrolysis was performed at 800$^{\\circ }$C. The reaction\nmixture was supplied for 40 minutes. The argon\ngas flow rate of 600 sccm was kept constant for an additional 15 minutes. After\nthat, the reactor was cooled to room temperature.\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:fig1}(b) shows an SEM image of a selected sample, which demonstrates a\nstable and well-defined hysteresis. We note that\ndetailed examination of CNT array surface (Fig. \\ref{fig:fig1}b) reveals\nbulging bundles of CNTs with a height of about 150 $\\mu$m. Inside\nthe bundles, CNTs are parallel relative to each other. These bundles are\ninclined relative to the normal.\n\n\n\nThe field emission from CNT arrays was studied in a diode regime in a vacuum\nchamber using a home-made set-up. In the experiment, a Si substrate with\nCNTs on top was attached from the bottom to a negative electrode (located on\na sample manipulator) by carbon conductive tape. The sample manipulator was\ninserted into the vacuum chamber, whose pressure was set to about $5\\cdot\n10^{-2}$ Pa. A triangle voltage waveform (from 0 V to 1.5 kV) of several\nfrequencies in the range from 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz was applied across  an anode\nand cathode. The distance $d$ between the flat anode and top surface of CNT\narray was set to approximately $5$ mm (see Fig. \\ref{fig:fig1}(a)).\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:fig2} presents some typical results obtained from measurements. According to Fig. \\ref{fig:fig2}(a), the system response is stable in different cycles. Importantly, the current density peaks are asymmetric, which indicates some changes in the system. The current-voltage curves shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:fig2}(b) are hysteretic in nature. We would like to point out that both the hysteresis size and shape depend on the voltage frequency applied. This is a common feature of memristive systems (see review paper [\\citeonline{pershin11a}] for examples). Moreover, according to Fig. \\ref{fig:fig2}, the field emission is observed at a quite low onset field of about 0.25 V/$\\mu $m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{fig3}\n\\caption{ Fitting 0.5 Hz loop in Fig. \\protect\\ref{fig:fig2}\n(b) with Fowler-Nordheim equation.
