In fact, a precise State of Charge (SoC) estimation allows the energy flows controller to exploit better the full capacity of each cell. In this paper, we propose an alternative definition for the SoC, explaining the rationales by a mechanical analogy. We introduce a novel cell model, conceived as a series of three electric dipoles, together with a procedure for parameters estimation relying only on voltage measures and a given current profile. The three dipoles represent the quasi-stationary, the dynamics and the istantaneous components of voltage measures. An Extended Kalman Filer (EKF) is adopted as a nonlinear state estimator. Moreover, we propose a multi-cell EKF system based on a round-robin approach to allow the same processing block to keep track of many cells at the same time. Performance tests with a prototype battery pack composed by 18 A123 cells connected in series show encouraging results.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{IEEEkeywords}\nNonlinear circuits, Mechanical Analogy, Battery modeling, Parameter identification, State of Charge estimation, Extended Kalman Filter.\n\\end{IEEEkeywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\n\\IEEEPARstart{M}{odern} engineering is already facing the fundamental challenge of improving energetic, environmental and social sustainability in the way energy is produced, distributed, delivered and even consumed by the final users. Many systems and technical components are on the verge of a disruptive transformation, driven by a complex multidisciplinary co-evolution process, where many vital subsystems are closely related one another. This revolution must be faced and performed taking into account a systemic point of view, able to drive technical advancements as sequences of systematic and coherent transformations. Urban areas planning and development, buildings design, electric generation and distribution systems, advanced telecommunication systems, intelligent multimodal transportation systems, cloud computing systems and intelligent processing systems  (just to cite some instances) will benefit each other of advances and technical improvements. Sustainability is the key term to drive and define precise definitions for any objective function acting as the fitness of each technological subsystem in this evolving scenario. \nFrom this point of view, just to cite an example, the revolution in transportation systems due to the introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) will contribute in driving the design of next generation of Smart Grids \\cite{Yu_2011,deSantis_2015,Storti_2015}, since electric mobility will be a huge additional load for both energy generation and distribution systems. At the same time, the massive introduction of EVs will yield a true reduction of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ emissions only if supported by a model of distributed energy generation from renewable sources. In turn, the stochastic nature of some promising renewable sources (photovoltaics plants and wind generators, for example) demands the presence of stationary energy storage systems (ESSs) to exploit fully the available energy, allowing the spread of Micro Grids. A Micro Grid can in fact be defined as a sub-network characterized by the presence of autonomous (often renewable) energy sources buffered by some type of ESS and locally controlled in order to achieve smart energy flows management \\cite{deSantis_2013}. In this scenario, the Smart Grid will evolve into a System of Systems (SoS), where most of the loads and energy sources will be localized into Micro Grids, organized as a hierarchical territorial granulation, and acting as cooperative/competitive agents in a complex energy trading network. The key components for the full deployment of this future technological setting are ESSs. Nowadays the most promising technology is represented by Li-Ion (Lithium Ion) and Li-Po (Lithium Polymer) battery systems, controlled by suited BMSs (Battery Management Systems).\nThe BMS represents the key component of every chemical ESS, since this electronic device is conceived and designed to manage, protect, monitor, balance and estimate the State of Charge (SoC) of rechargeable batteries. An accurate SoC determination in Li-Ion batteries is the most important aspect for maximizing the battery pack usage and to evaluate and monitor correctly its State of Health (SoH). Determining the exact amount of energy available in a battery is an extremely difficult endeavor, due to the lack of deep knowledge of the electro-chemical behavior of a cell. The only available option is to perform an estimation of the SoC based on an external characterization of the cell, i.e. based on current and voltage measurements. In the literature there exits several techniques to perform this estimation: open circuit voltage (OCV) calculation, coulomb counting, and/or more sophisticated techniques that employ state estimators such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In the paper, we propose a new battery model and a procedure to characterize a cell, by estimating model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parameters, finalized to enhance SoC estimation. We explain the procedure relying on a mechanical (hydraulics) analogy. Once performed the parameters estimation, by a suited data driven external characterization, an EKF is employed to lock and track the status of the system. Moreover, we propose a round-robin approach to keep track of the states of multiple cells, by relying on a single implementation of the EKF block. The system is designed to fully exploit all the available computational power of the embedded system running the SoC procedure, and it is based on the fact that in practical applications currents are band-limited signals, characterized by very low maximum frequencies, and thus allowing low sampling rates. \nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect.~\\ref{sec::soc} we describe a novel way to define the SoC of a rechargeable cell, while in Sect.~\\ref{sec::model} we explain the proposed cell model, defined as a series of three dipoles, each one defined to model contributions affecting the cell behavior at different time scales. Sect.~\\ref{sec::parameter} depicts the parameters identification procedure, conceived to isolate and compute the quasi-static, dynamical and istantaneou contributions, by feeding the cell with a suited current profile. The Muli-cell EKF is presented in Sect.~\\ref{sec::multi_cell_ekf}. Test setups and results for both the model and the Multi-cell EKF are reported in Sect.~\\ref{sec::results}. Finally, our conclusions are drown in Sect.~\\ref{sec::conclusion}.\n\n\n\\section{Consderations on the state of charge}\n\\label{sec::soc}\n\n\\subsection{Introduction}\n\nThe SoC is a time dependent quantity representing the percentage of the total storable charge still drainable from a cell at a given instant of time \\cite{Zou_2014}.

According with the arguments discussed in section \\ref{sec::analogy}, the voltage measured at the cell terminals has been modeled as the summation of contributions affecting the cell behavior at different time scales.\nIn order to include in the model a direct dependence between input current $I_{in}$ and output voltage $V_{out}$, an instantaneous contribution $V_{ist}=\\hat{V}_{ist}(I_{in})$ has been added to the quasi-stationary $V_{qst}$ and the dynamic $V_{dyn}$ contributions described in section \\ref{sec::analogy}.\n\nAccording with the previous arguments it can be stated that:\n\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nV_{out}(t)=V_{qst}(t)+V_{dyn}(t)+\\hat{V}_{ist}(I_{in}(t))\n\\label{eq::Vout}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"V_{out}(t)=V_{qst}(t)+V_{dyn}(t)+\\hat{V}_{ist}(I_{in}(t))\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04554.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nIt should be noted that $C_{qst}(V_{qst}(t))$ in \\eqref{eq::Vqstdot} represents the nonlinear stationary capacity of the cell (\\textit{i.e.} its `internal shape').  \n\nIn order to keep the model as simple as possible at this stage, the dynamic component $V_{dyn}(t)$ will be considered as the summation of $N$ linear first order filters.\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17742, "prevtext": "\n\nRelation \\eqref{eq::Vout} can be considered as the output equation of the state form representation of the cell model. \n\nIn order to complete the state form representation of the cell model we need to chose appropriate state variables.

In order to improve the readability of the plot both $V_{ist}(t)$ and $V_{dyn}(t)$ have been added to $V_{min}$.\nFrom \\figurename~\\ref{fig::IinVout}, it is possible to realize that the only voltage contribution for zero current is the dynamical one \\textit{i.e.}  $V_{out}(t)=V_{dyn}(t)$ for $I_{in}(t)=0$. This property is really useful to identify $V_{dyn}$ (\\textit{i.e.} the wave dynamics). Moreover, it should be noted that when subject to positive and to negative current pulses, $V_{dyn}$ exhibits a non symmetrical behavior resulting in an error in the open circuit voltage estimation when the mean value between the charge and the discharge branches is considered \\cite{Hu_2011, Baronti_2015}.\n\nAccording with the literature, the estimated $V_{qst}(t)$ exhibits different behaviour during charge and discharge.

The hysteretic behavior of the cell produces different capacitances (shapes) for the charge and the discharge process. In order to simplify the model, we are forced to consider an average between the charge and the discharge behaviors. Consequently, the static capacitance of the cell $C_{qst}(V_{qst})$ can be estimated applying \\eqref{eq::cp} to the mean curve shown in red in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::OCVSOC}.

This argument can be used as a constructive definition of the nominal voltage $V_n$ and it strengthens the choice made in this paper to use $V_{min}$ and $V_{max}$ values closer to $V_{n}$ with respect to the values given by the constructor. Moreover, it is interesting to note that following the proposed procedure there is just a small shift $\\Delta V_{n}$ between the nominal voltage given by the cell constructor and the peak of the estimated statical capacitance. \n\n\\section{Multi-Cell Extended Kalman Filter}\n\\label{sec::multi_cell_ekf}\n\n\\subsection{Framework}\n\\label{sec::multi_cell_ekf_framework}\n\nAs well known in  the literature, the EKF is a powerful method to estimate the states of a nonlinear system such as internal parameters and SoC of a battery. \nHowever, this approach presents several weak points:\n(i) the precision of the model implemented into the observer can heavily influence the estimation precision; (ii) depending on the application the time convergence to reach a reasonable estimation can be too long; (iii) the initialization of the auto-covariance Q matrix can be difficult; (iv) the EKF is able to estimate the states of only one system (\\textit{i.e.} a single cell). \nIn order to improve the robustness and the reliability of this methodology, regarding points (i), (ii) and (iii), it is possible to increase the complexity of the battery model, perform a better initial condition estimation and empirically find the best Q matrix values, respectively.\n\nConsidering point (iv), to our best knowledge, to date has not been proposed any approach allowing the estimation of the states of multiple cells using only one observer (\\textit{i.e.} EKF).\nThus, in a real system composed by dozens of cells, as many EKFs have to be implemented, exacerbating the complexity of the system and the used memory space.\nFor these reasons, in the last year the University of Rome Sapienza and the Ohio State University have worked together in order to find a way to develop a novel methodology defined Multi-Cell EKF.\nThe idea is quite simple and it is based on the well known round-robin strategy, where time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority.\nStarting from this idea, it has been implemented a framework that allows a single EKF to perform the states estimation of different batteries.\nIndeed, considering the ``slow'' evolution of voltage and current during normal applications, it is reasonable to expect similarly slow changes of battery conditions.\n\nThe block diagram explaining the round-robin approach is reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram}.\nEven though the round-robin strategy is well known, some relevant comment can be made.\nUsing this novel approach, the estimation of cells either with the same chemistry or not residing either in the same battery pack or in different ones is possible.\nIndeed, as shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram}, the EKF receives only voltage and current values ignoring any other information of the cells (\\textit{i.e.} chemistry and position in the battery pack).\n\nIn order to simplify the description of this novel Multi-Cell EKF, we consider a battery pack constituted by the connection in series of cells all having the same chemistry.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.375]{multi_cell_framework_diagram}\n\t\\caption{General block diagram of the Multi-Cell EKF framework.}\n\t\\label{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nEven though the round-robin concept shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram} can appear quite simple, its correct implementation is not trivial due to the recursive structure of the observer. \nIn fact the EKF algorithm is composed by two steps defined \\textit{Prediction} and \\textit{Correction}.\nThe first step involves projecting both the most recent states estimation and an estimate of the error covariance (from the previous time period) forwards in time to compute a predicted (or a-priori) estimate of the states at the current time. The second step involves correcting the predicted states calculated in the first step by incorporating the most recent process measurement to generate an updated (or a-posteriori) state estimation.\nThus, applying the round-robin strategy, for each time slice the \n\\textit{Prediction} step has to be fed by suitable data from the  \\textit{Correction} step at the previous time period. \nAlong this line, the general framework block diagram shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram} has been modified as shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}, where the actual EKF has been used as an engine to perform calculations, whereas the framework has been used to change the cell under test every time slice.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.285]{multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}\n\t\\caption{Block diagram of the developed Multi-Cell EKF framework.}\n\t\\label{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nIn the block diagram reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}, it is possible to see how the round-robin structure is implemented using multiplexers (MUXs), demultiplexers (DEMUXs), memories (MEMs) driven by a common clock signal. \nMUXs have been used to select suitable data for each time slice, MEMs have been used to store real time data of each cell, DEMUXs have been used to properly separate variables contained in arrays and the clock has been used to set the sampling time $T_{slice}$.\nThe EKF Prediction and Correction blocks are two common processing blocks with known latencies. This modular design allows to modify, tune and improve the latter blocks, without modifying the remainder of the system.  \nFurthermore, as mentioned before in cases where cells have different chemistry, it is possible to customize, for instance, the battery internal parameters increasing the versatility of the proposed method.\n\nThe MUXs and DEMUXs blocks shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2} perform standard functions, so they can be implemented using built-in blocks or custom functions according to the programming environment available. \nThese blocks have been used to separate or concatenate the variables to or from the MEMs blocks that represent the states and the auto-covariance Q matrix, respectively.\nMEMs blocks, used to properly store data, have been implemented using a custom solution.\nThese blocks, playing a vital role, constitute the most important part of the entire Multi-Cell EKF structure.\nA single MEM block has to be used for every EKF state (\\textit{i.e.} $V_{qst}$ and $V_{dyn}$).\nThe block diagram of a single MEM is reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::mem_diagram}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.275]{mem_diagram}\n\t\\caption{Inner part of the MEM block.}\n\t\\label{fig::mem_diagram}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor each time step, the single variable coming from the \\textit{Correction} block is properly addressed to the specific delay block and stored, whereas its previous value is sent as output variable to the \\textit{Prediction} block.\nThis updating operation is performed on a single cell at the time, driven by the clock rate, while all the other data are left unchanged.\n\n\\subsection{Determining the maximum number of cells}\n\\label{sec::maximum_number}  \n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the proposed framework gives the possibility to perform states estimation of different cells implementing a single EKF. \nAimed to determine the maximum number of cells that the Multi-Cell EKF can deal with in a real scenario, a realistic current profile has been used.\nThe current profile, shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::US06_current} part~(a), is derived from the well known US06 driving profile, where a maximum current limitation of 44~[A] (10 C-Rate) is considered. This constraint has been applied only for safety reasons, based on the cell characteristics of the cell used in the actual test (see \\tablename~\\ref{tab::A123_32113_specs}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\psfrag{Mod}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$|I_{in}(\\omega)|$,~[As]}}\n\t\\psfrag{freq}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$\\omega$,[Hz]}}\n\t\\psfrag{Amps}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$I_{in}(t)$,~[A]}}\n    \\psfrag{Time}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$t$,[s]}}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{c}\n\t   \\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{US06_current}\\\\\n\t   (a)\\\\\n\t   \\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{US06_spectrum}\\\\\n\t   (b)\\\\\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\t\\caption{Current profile derived from the standard US06 driving cycle: (a) time evolution, (b) spectrum.}\n\t\\label{fig::US06_current}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe spectrum of the input signal $I_{in}(t)$ is reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::US06_current} part~(b), where the maximum frequency can be cautiously fixed to 2~Hz.\nThe maximum number of the cells that the Multi-Cell EKF can manage is dictated by the input signal maximum frequency (\\textit{i.e.} current and voltage) as well described in the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\nBy setting the time slot $T_{slot}$ (slice time of each process in the round-robin strategy) equal to 10~ms to allow the correct computation of the data with the available hardware, the maximum number of the cells supported by the Multi-Cell EKF is computed as follows:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 24844, "prevtext": " \n\nEquation \\eqref{eq::Vout}, \\eqref{eq::Vqstdot} and \\eqref{eq::Vdyndot} can be interpreted, as shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::3Blocks}, as the series connection of a nonlinear capacitor, a non linear resistor and a cascade of a certain number of RC groups.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n    \\psfrag{Vout}[c][t][1]{$V_{out}(t)$}\n    \\psfrag{Iin}[c][t][1]{$I_{in}(t)$}\n    \\psfrag{Vdyn}[c][b][1]{$V_{dyn}(t)$}\n    \\psfrag{Vist}[c][b][1]{$V_{ist}(t)$}\n    \\psfrag{Vqst}[c][b][1]{$V_{qst}(t)$}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{3Blocks}\n\t\\caption{Equivalent circuit of the cell}\n\t\\label{fig::3Blocks}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Parameter identification}\n\\label{sec::parameter}\n\nIn order to determine the model parameters introduced in section \\ref{sec::model}, we should apply the characterization procedure described in section \\ref{sec::analogy} to determine the reservoir's shape to a specific cell.\nThe cell taken into consideration in this paper is the A123 Nanophosphate AHR32113M1Ultra-B.

It is composed by:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item 6 hours of discharging at a constant 0.4~[A] rate\n\\item 12 hours of rest\n\\item 6 hours of charging at a constant 0.4~[A] rate\n\\item 12 hours of rest\n\\item 1 hour of variable current composed by the concatenation of 6 US06 current profiles shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::US06_current}~part~(a)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nDuring the first 36 hours the current profile is quite similar to the one shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::IandV}~part~(a) used in the identification procedure. We take this choice to verify that the model works well in a slow dynamic situation. Conversely, for the latter hour of the current profile, we take a high dynamic behavior in order to stress the model.\nA comparison between the actual voltage acquired from the cell and the one estimated by the model and their absolute error is reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::voltage_comparison} for the latter hour.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbph]\n\\centering\n    \\psfrag{Volts}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{out}$,~[V]}}\n    \\psfrag{Volts1}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{Error,~[mV]}}\n    \\psfrag{Time}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{Time,[h]}}\n\\begin{tabular}{c}\n\\includegraphics[scale=.24, angle=0]{ModelComparison_zoom} \\\\ \n(a)\\\\\n\\includegraphics[scale=.24, angle=0]{ErrorModelComparison_zoom} \\\\\n(b)\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Comparison between model and actual voltage: (a) Comparison, (b) absolute difference.}\n\\label{fig::voltage_comparison}    \n\\end{figure}\n\nInspecting \\figurename~\\ref{fig::voltage_comparison}~part~(b) a few considerations can be made. \n\nFirst of all it should be noted that the voltage produced by the model is almost always less than the actual one. This behavior is probably due to the inability of the model in describing hysteresis phenomena. Even if the results achieved with the actual model are encouraging, we believe that a better modeling of the hysteresis phenomena should reduce the mean value of the error. \n\n\\subsection{Multi-Cell EKF Validation}\n\nOnce the model is validated, in order to verify the effectiveness of the Multi-Cell EKF in a real operative scenario, we decided to exploit the same current profile used to validate the model, on a prototype battery pack composed by 18 A123 Nanophosphate AHR32113M1Ultra-B connected in series. Before starting the test all the 18 cells have been prepared to ensure the condition $V_{qst}=V_{max}$.\nThe Multi-Cell EKF registers have been set with an initial $V_{qst}$ value corresponding to about the $80\\%$ of the total storable charge. Being the actual cells charged at $V_{qst}=V_{max}$ the initial error on the state estimation is about $20\\%$.\n\nThe results of the SoC estimation performed by the Multi-Cell EKF are reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::soc_initial_100_parallel}, where the Coulomb counting has been used as SoC reference.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbph]\n\\centering\n\\psfrag{Q}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{SoC}}\n\\psfrag{Time}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{Time,[h]}}\n\\begin{tabular}{c}\n\\includegraphics[scale=.24, angle=0]{SoCs_18June2015_results} \\\\ \n(a)\\\\\n\\includegraphics[scale=.25, angle=0]{SoCs_18June2015_results_zoom} \\\\\n(b)\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Comparison between Coulomb counting (blue) and the SoC of the 18 cells estimated by the Multi-Cell EKF (red): (a) full test, (b) zoom of the US06 section.}\n\\label{fig::soc_initial_100_parallel}    \n\\end{figure}\n\nAs visible in the \\figurename~\\ref{fig::soc_initial_100_parallel}~part~(a), the Multi-Cell EKF is able to engage the SoC reference as a traditional EKF showing how the proposed framework does not alter its functioning. In the part (b) of the same figure is depicted a zoom of the latter hour of the test showing that in high dynamical condition the SoC estimated of each cell is slightly different from the others with a maximum difference up to $10\\%$ with the reference.\nThis behavior is expected since in an operative scenario the cells differ one to each other in terms of internal parameters, age, etc..\nIn order to perform a better estimation, authors are actually working on an improved round-robin strategy able to include cell to cell tailored parameters. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec::conclusion}\n\nAn alternative SoC definition, based on a mechanical analogy, has been introduced in order to avercome a few limits of the standard definition. Based on the same analogy, a novel equivalent nonlinear circuit model of a cell has been derived together with a suitable parameters identification procedure which avoid the use of non physical components such as SoC dependant resistors. A multi-cell SoC estimation using a single EKF making use of a round-robin approach has been described and a design procedure to extimate the maximum number of cell it is possible to menage with a singol EKF filter has been derived. The tests conducted to validate the model show a good accuracy in SoC estimation, even in very challenging conditions. Similar test conducted on a prototype battery pack composed of 18 cells connected in series show the ability of the proposed EKF to prerform an accurate multi-cell SoC estimation. \n\n\\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}\n\\bibliography{../../../reference_database/references_db}\n\n\\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{MP}}]{Maurizio Paschero}  is a post doctoral research associate at the Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications Department of the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\" since September 2008, where he works in the Polo per la Mobilit\\`{a} Sostenibile (POMOS) Laboratories.\nHe received his M.S in Electronic Engineering 2003 and the Ph.D in Information and Communication Engineering in 2006 from the University \"La Sapienza\" of Rome and the Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering in 2008 from Virginia Polytechnic Insitute and State University.\nHis major fields of interest include Smart Grids, circuital modeling of multi-physic systems, intelligent signal processing, and battery modeling.\n\n\\end{IEEEbiography}\n\n\\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{GLS}}]{Gian Luca Storti} is a post doctoral research associate at Center for Automotive Research of Ohio State University since May 2015.\nHe received his B.S and his M.S in Electronic Engineering from \"La Sapienza\" University, Rome, Italy, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.\nHe received his Ph.D. in the Information Engineering, Electronics \nand Telecommunications Department in 2015 from the same university.\nHis major field of interest include the Smart Grids, intelligent signal processing, modeling and control \nof hybrid powertrain, design of automotive electrical system and battery modeling.\n\n\\end{IEEEbiography}\n\n\\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{AR}}]{Antonello Rizzi} \n(S\u00e2\u0080\u009998-M\u00e2\u0080\u009904) received the Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering in 2000, from the University of Rome \u00e2\u0080\u009dLa Sapienza\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

In order to improve the readability of the plot both $V_{ist}(t)$ and $V_{dyn}(t)$ have been added to $V_{min}$.\nFrom \\figurename~\\ref{fig::IinVout}, it is possible to realize that the only voltage contribution for zero current is the dynamical one \\textit{i.e.}  $V_{out}(t)=V_{dyn}(t)$ for $I_{in}(t)=0$. This property is really useful to identify $V_{dyn}$ (\\textit{i.e.} the wave dynamics). Moreover, it should be noted that when subject to positive and to negative current pulses, $V_{dyn}$ exhibits a non symmetrical behavior resulting in an error in the open circuit voltage estimation when the mean value between the charge and the discharge branches is considered \\cite{Hu_2011, Baronti_2015}.\n\nAccording with the literature, the estimated $V_{qst}(t)$ exhibits different behaviour during charge and discharge. In fact, plotting the current integral $Q(t)$ versus this portion of the output voltage, the characteristic $Q(V_{qst})$ shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::OCVSOC} is obtained. \n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n    \\psfrag{Q}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$Q(V_{qst}) / \\Delta Q$}}\n    \\psfrag{Volts}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{qst}$,~[V]}}\n    \\psfrag{Vmax}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{max}$}}\n    \\psfrag{Vmin}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{min}$}}\n    \\psfrag{Vn}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{n}$}}\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{QofV}\n\t\\caption{$Q(V_{qst})$ characteristic.

The hysteretic behavior of the cell produces different capacitances (shapes) for the charge and the discharge process. In order to simplify the model, we are forced to consider an average between the charge and the discharge behaviors. Consequently, the static capacitance of the cell $C_{qst}(V_{qst})$ can be estimated applying \\eqref{eq::cp} to the mean curve shown in red in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::OCVSOC}. The curve obtained for  $C_{qst}(V_{qst})$ is plotted in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::capqst}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n    \\psfrag{Vqst}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{qst}$,~[V]}}\n    \\psfrag{Vmin}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{min}$}}\n    \\psfrag{Vmax}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{max}$}}\n    \\psfrag{Vn}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$V_{n}$}}\n    \\psfrag{DVn}[c][c][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$\\Delta V_{n}$}}\n    \\psfrag{C}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$C_{qst}(V_{qst})$,~[F]}}\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{CofV}\n\t\\caption{Estimated nonlinear statical capacity}\n\t\\label{fig::capqst}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFrom the plot it is evident that most of the charge is accumulated around a single statical voltage value corresponding to the maximum value of the capacitance. This argument can be used as a constructive definition of the nominal voltage $V_n$ and it strengthens the choice made in this paper to use $V_{min}$ and $V_{max}$ values closer to $V_{n}$ with respect to the values given by the constructor. Moreover, it is interesting to note that following the proposed procedure there is just a small shift $\\Delta V_{n}$ between the nominal voltage given by the cell constructor and the peak of the estimated statical capacitance. \n\n\\section{Multi-Cell Extended Kalman Filter}\n\\label{sec::multi_cell_ekf}\n\n\\subsection{Framework}\n\\label{sec::multi_cell_ekf_framework}\n\nAs well known in  the literature, the EKF is a powerful method to estimate the states of a nonlinear system such as internal parameters and SoC of a battery. \nHowever, this approach presents several weak points:\n(i) the precision of the model implemented into the observer can heavily influence the estimation precision; (ii) depending on the application the time convergence to reach a reasonable estimation can be too long; (iii) the initialization of the auto-covariance Q matrix can be difficult; (iv) the EKF is able to estimate the states of only one system (\\textit{i.e.} a single cell). \nIn order to improve the robustness and the reliability of this methodology, regarding points (i), (ii) and (iii), it is possible to increase the complexity of the battery model, perform a better initial condition estimation and empirically find the best Q matrix values, respectively.\n\nConsidering point (iv), to our best knowledge, to date has not been proposed any approach allowing the estimation of the states of multiple cells using only one observer (\\textit{i.e.} EKF).\nThus, in a real system composed by dozens of cells, as many EKFs have to be implemented, exacerbating the complexity of the system and the used memory space.\nFor these reasons, in the last year the University of Rome Sapienza and the Ohio State University have worked together in order to find a way to develop a novel methodology defined Multi-Cell EKF.\nThe idea is quite simple and it is based on the well known round-robin strategy, where time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority.\nStarting from this idea, it has been implemented a framework that allows a single EKF to perform the states estimation of different batteries.\nIndeed, considering the ``slow'' evolution of voltage and current during normal applications, it is reasonable to expect similarly slow changes of battery conditions.\n\nThe block diagram explaining the round-robin approach is reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram}.\nEven though the round-robin strategy is well known, some relevant comment can be made.\nUsing this novel approach, the estimation of cells either with the same chemistry or not residing either in the same battery pack or in different ones is possible.\nIndeed, as shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram}, the EKF receives only voltage and current values ignoring any other information of the cells (\\textit{i.e.} chemistry and position in the battery pack).\n\nIn order to simplify the description of this novel Multi-Cell EKF, we consider a battery pack constituted by the connection in series of cells all having the same chemistry.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.375]{multi_cell_framework_diagram}\n\t\\caption{General block diagram of the Multi-Cell EKF framework.}\n\t\\label{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nEven though the round-robin concept shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram} can appear quite simple, its correct implementation is not trivial due to the recursive structure of the observer. \nIn fact the EKF algorithm is composed by two steps defined \\textit{Prediction} and \\textit{Correction}.\nThe first step involves projecting both the most recent states estimation and an estimate of the error covariance (from the previous time period) forwards in time to compute a predicted (or a-priori) estimate of the states at the current time. The second step involves correcting the predicted states calculated in the first step by incorporating the most recent process measurement to generate an updated (or a-posteriori) state estimation.\nThus, applying the round-robin strategy, for each time slice the \n\\textit{Prediction} step has to be fed by suitable data from the  \\textit{Correction} step at the previous time period. \nAlong this line, the general framework block diagram shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram} has been modified as shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}, where the actual EKF has been used as an engine to perform calculations, whereas the framework has been used to change the cell under test every time slice.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.285]{multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}\n\t\\caption{Block diagram of the developed Multi-Cell EKF framework.}\n\t\\label{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nIn the block diagram reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2}, it is possible to see how the round-robin structure is implemented using multiplexers (MUXs), demultiplexers (DEMUXs), memories (MEMs) driven by a common clock signal. \nMUXs have been used to select suitable data for each time slice, MEMs have been used to store real time data of each cell, DEMUXs have been used to properly separate variables contained in arrays and the clock has been used to set the sampling time $T_{slice}$.\nThe EKF Prediction and Correction blocks are two common processing blocks with known latencies. This modular design allows to modify, tune and improve the latter blocks, without modifying the remainder of the system.  \nFurthermore, as mentioned before in cases where cells have different chemistry, it is possible to customize, for instance, the battery internal parameters increasing the versatility of the proposed method.\n\nThe MUXs and DEMUXs blocks shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::multi_cell_framework_diagram_2} perform standard functions, so they can be implemented using built-in blocks or custom functions according to the programming environment available. \nThese blocks have been used to separate or concatenate the variables to or from the MEMs blocks that represent the states and the auto-covariance Q matrix, respectively.\nMEMs blocks, used to properly store data, have been implemented using a custom solution.\nThese blocks, playing a vital role, constitute the most important part of the entire Multi-Cell EKF structure.\nA single MEM block has to be used for every EKF state (\\textit{i.e.} $V_{qst}$ and $V_{dyn}$).\nThe block diagram of a single MEM is reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::mem_diagram}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.275]{mem_diagram}\n\t\\caption{Inner part of the MEM block.}\n\t\\label{fig::mem_diagram}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor each time step, the single variable coming from the \\textit{Correction} block is properly addressed to the specific delay block and stored, whereas its previous value is sent as output variable to the \\textit{Prediction} block.\nThis updating operation is performed on a single cell at the time, driven by the clock rate, while all the other data are left unchanged.\n\n\\subsection{Determining the maximum number of cells}\n\\label{sec::maximum_number}  \n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the proposed framework gives the possibility to perform states estimation of different cells implementing a single EKF. \nAimed to determine the maximum number of cells that the Multi-Cell EKF can deal with in a real scenario, a realistic current profile has been used.\nThe current profile, shown in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::US06_current} part~(a), is derived from the well known US06 driving profile, where a maximum current limitation of 44~[A] (10 C-Rate) is considered. This constraint has been applied only for safety reasons, based on the cell characteristics of the cell used in the actual test (see \\tablename~\\ref{tab::A123_32113_specs}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\psfrag{Mod}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$|I_{in}(\\omega)|$,~[As]}}\n\t\\psfrag{freq}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$\\omega$,[Hz]}}\n\t\\psfrag{Amps}[c][t][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$I_{in}(t)$,~[A]}}\n    \\psfrag{Time}[c][b][0.9]{\\scriptsize{$t$,[s]}}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{c}\n\t   \\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{US06_current}\\\\\n\t   (a)\\\\\n\t   \\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{US06_spectrum}\\\\\n\t   (b)\\\\\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\t\\caption{Current profile derived from the standard US06 driving cycle: (a) time evolution, (b) spectrum.}\n\t\\label{fig::US06_current}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe spectrum of the input signal $I_{in}(t)$ is reported in \\figurename~\\ref{fig::US06_current} part~(b), where the maximum frequency can be cautiously fixed to 2~Hz.\nThe maximum number of the cells that the Multi-Cell EKF can manage is dictated by the input signal maximum frequency (\\textit{i.e.} current and voltage) as well described in the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\nBy setting the time slot $T_{slot}$ (slice time of each process in the round-robin strategy) equal to 10~ms to allow the correct computation of the data with the available hardware, the maximum number of the cells supported by the Multi-Cell EKF is computed as follows:\n\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\#Cells T_{slot} \\leq \\frac{1}{2 f_{max}} \\Rightarrow \\#Cells  \\leq \\frac{1}{2 f_{max}T_{slot}}= 25\n\\label{eq::number_cells}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\#CellsT_{slot}\\leq\\frac{1}{2f_{max}}\\Rightarrow\\#Cells\\leq\\frac{1}{2f_{max}T_%&#10;{slot}}=25\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u21d2</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">#</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>25</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
