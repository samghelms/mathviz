It may sound odd since hydrodynamic description \nis a goal of statistical mechanics of liquid and gas.\nHowever, statistical theory of turbulence has set the problem in this way:\nthe macroscopic laws correspond to \nthe statistical laws of the turbulent velocity fluctuations;\nthe microscopic interaction rule corresponds to the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes (NS) equations; the microscopic elements correspond formally \nto Fourier modes if we expand a solution in Fourier series. \n\nWe consider that \nthe statistical laws of the turbulence due to Kolmogorov \\cite{f} are \nimportant, not only to fluid dynamics, in the following respect. \nAmong prevalent scaling laws of driven-dissipative systems, \nthose found in power spectra or multiscaling laws\nare often analyzed \nby drawing analogy to the laws of turbulence, see, e.g., \\cite{br,mr,vpb}. \nIn so doing, the exponent of the scaling law, for example, can be predicted\nwith the dissipation rate of the system's quantity which conserves\nin the ideal, dissipationless setting.\nSuccess of this scheme may rely on whether or not the quantity is\nin the state of cascade: it is pumped at some scale by the driving force\nand is dissipated at another distant scale; in between it is transferred \nby the nonlinear interactions among nearby scales and the averaged \ntransfer rate becomes scale independent.\nHowever the conservation \nlaw  does not guarantee its cascade. \nIdentifying condition for the cascade or, which conservative quantity\ndetermines the scaling law, is thus important not only for the turbulence research \nbut also for other fields, which we study via a simple model.\n\n\\textit{Model.-} \nSince the three-dimensional (3D) NS equations are one of the toughest equations, \nmany reduced models for turbulence are developed. \nCelebrated ones include the Burgers' equation \\cite{burg} \nand the shell models \\cite{Bi}. \nThe limitation of the former is the lack of the hallmark of turbulence,\nnamely the energy cascade and the multiscaling statistics. \nThe latter succeed in reproducing it but has no information on its consequence \nin the physical space. \nThe model we propose is shown to be free from these limitations, \nwhich is a one dimensional equation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t \\omega + a u \\partial_x \\omega = \\omega \\partial_x u + \\nu \\partial_{xx}\\omega + f.\n\\label{gDG}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere we call it the generalized De Gregorio (gDG) equation.\nIt is a one dimensional  analogue of the 3D vorticity equation if $a = 1$.\nHere $\\omega(x, t)$ is the scalar model vorticity, $a$ is a parameter discussed below, \n$u(x, t)$ is the model velocity, $\\nu$ is the model kinematic viscosity and $f(x, t)$ is \nthe forcing. \nThe velocity is expressed in terms of the vorticity \nas $u = -(-\\partial_{xx})^{-1/2}\\omega$ and $\\partial_x u = H(\\omega)$\nwhich is the Hilbert transform of $\\omega$.\nHistorically, the original De Gregorio equation ($a = 1, f = 0$ in Eq.(\\ref{gDG})) \\cite{dg1, dg2}\nfollows the influential Constatin-Lax-Majda (CLM) equation ($a,\\nu$ and $f$ are zero) which is \nintroduced as a model of the vortex stretching of the 3D Euler equation \\cite{clm}.\nThe parameter $a$ in front of the advection term was introduced as a generalization\nof the De Gregorio equation in \\cite{oswn} (see also \\cite{oswdcds, ccf} for mathematical results).\n\nHere is a twist: negative $a$ can be considered at the expense of the analogy\nto the 3D vorticity equation.\nInstead, we gain the conservation law. Namely for $a < 0$,\nit is shown easily that $\\int \\vert \\omega(x, t)\\vert^{-a} dx$ conserves\nfor $\\nu = f = 0$ \\cite{oswn}.\nConsequently the issue addressed in the introduction\nis studied with Eq.(\\ref{gDG}):\ndoes the gDG model exhibit features of fluid turbulence such as\nthe cascade of the conservative quantity \nand the multiscaling of the vorticity?\nIf so, what is the key ingredient of the gDG model that gives rise to \nthe statistical properties of turbulence?\n\nWithout the inviscid conservation law, Eq.(\\ref{gDG}) does not yield \nturbulence:\nin our simulation of $a = 1$ case, the energy keeps concentrating\non the forcing scale and the inertial range (IR) in the energy spectrum is not \ndeveloped. Thus the gDG model with $a = 1$ does not become turbulent, albeit \nthe similarity to the 3D vorticity equation.\nIn this Letter, we limit ourselves to $a = -2$ as the simplest case with\nthe inviscid conservative quantity which is the spatial integral of \nthe squared vorticity (the enstrophy).\nThis is analogous to the two-dimensional (2D) NS equations. \nOur goal is \nto demonstrate that the case exhibits turbulent features \nand \nto analyze them by comparison with the enstrophy-cascade turbulence of the 2D NS equations.\nWe note here that the enstrophy-cascade turbulence \\cite{km,t,g,b} is\nmore mysterious than the 3D NS turbulence, in particular, whether or not\nthe energy spectrum has the logarithmic correction  \\cite{k71,lk72} \nto the Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor $k^{-3}$ spectrum \\cite{k67, l68, b69},\nand whether or not the vorticity structure function has (multi)-scaling property.\nThese problems of the enstrophy-cascade turbulence can be studied\nvia the gDG equation with $a = -2$ as we will see. \nWe also try to describe the gDG turbulence from a dynamical system point of view.\n\n\\textit{Numerical simulation of the model.--}\nWe numerically simulate the gDG equation (\\ref{gDG}) for $a = -2$ \nin a periodic interval of length $2\\pi$ with a standard dealiased spectral method by assuming \nnull vorticity Fourier mode of the zero wavenumber using the fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme\nand the same filtering of the round-off noise as \\cite{oswn}.\nTo achieve a statistically steady state, the large-scale forcing $f(x, t)$ is set to be random:\nits Fourier coefficient $\\hat{f}(k, t)$ is non zero\nonly for the forcing wavenumbers $k = \\pm 1$, whose real and imaginary parts are set by \nGaussian, delta-correlated-in-time and independent random variables with zero mean and \nvariance, $\\sigma_f^2$.\nSpecifically, keeping $\\sigma_f = 1.0\\times10^{-2}$, we vary the kinematic viscosity as\n$\\nu = \\nu_0 \\times 4^{-m} ~(m = 0, 1, 2)$ with $\\nu_0 = 2.5\\times10^{-5}$.\nThe corresponding time step, $\\Delta t$, and the number of grid points, $N$, are\n$(\\Delta t, N) = (2.5\\times10^{-4} \\times 2^{-m}, 2^{13 + m})$.\n\n\\begin{figure} \n \\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{spc_paper_revised.ps}\n\\caption{\\label{spec}(Color online) \n\\textit{Top inset}: a typical snapshot of the vorticity with pulse structures\nand the velocity of the randomly forced gDG equation.\n\\textit{Main figure}: the time-averaged energy spectra, $E(k)$, of\nthe forced gDG equation for three values of the viscosity.\nThe dashed line is Eq.(\\ref{e}) for the inertial range.\n\\textit{Bottom inset}: the corresponding time-averaged enstrophy fluxes, $\\Pi_Q(k)$.}\n\\end{figure}\nIn the top inset of Fig.\\ref{spec}, we show an example of the vorticity and velocity from \nthe middle viscosity case.

The spectrum of the latter is occasionally fitted with the power law\n$k^{-3.3}$ \\cite{g,b,cee,cg,rae}. \nRegarding the vorticity structure functions of the 2D turbulence,\nthe result obtained in the laboratory experiment \\cite{pct}\nshowed that those of even orders up to $10$ in the IR have power-law exponents \nindistinguishable from zero.\nThis is consistent with the theoretical results\nbeyond dimensional analysis of the 2D turbulence \\cite{fl, ey}.\nWe note that in \\cite{pct} \nno indication of $\\zeta_2 > \\zeta_4$ was observed, assuming\nthat the structure function in the IR is a power-law function.\nNumerical results of the 2D turbulence showed that $S_2(r)$ \nis logarithmic without a power law and that $S_4(r)$ is a decreasing \nfunction \\cite{vl}, however.\nSwitching to the velocity, we observe that both the even-order velocity structure functions \nand the even-order moments of the second-degree increments of the velocity \\cite{fra}\nof the gDG turbulence are not power-law functions in the IR as indicated by \ntheir logarithmic local slopes without plateau.\nThis is in contrast with the 2D turbulence \\cite{bclvv, cg}.\nTherefore, the gDG turbulence obeys distinct statistics    \nfrom the 2D turbulence despite the analogous enstrophy cascade.\nFurther details will be studied with a stationary solution of Eq.(\\ref{gDG})\nas follows.\n\n\\textit{Stationary solution}.-\nSurprisingly, the forced gDG equation has a stable stationary solution whose\nenergy spectrum is indistinguishable to that of the gDG turbulence in the IR,\nas shown in Fig.\\ref{statio}.\nWe find it incidentally when we change the random forcing \nto a deterministic and stationary one, $f(x, t) = C_0 \\sin x$, \nin order to study dependence of the statistics on the large-scale forcing.\nThus it demonstrates the striking forcing dependence.\nWe here fix the forcing amplitude $C_0 = -0.1$ and \nvary $\\nu$ as $10^{-4} \\times 4^{-m} ~(m = 0, 1, \\ldots, 5)$. \nWe use the same spectral method and time stepping as before \nwith the corresponding time step $\\Delta t = 2.5\\times 10^{-4} \\times 2^{-m}$ \nand the number of grid points $N = 2^{13 + m}$. \nThe stationary solution has one vorticity pulse as depicted in the right inset of \nFig.\\ref{statio}, which is likely to converge to a singular function (infinite vorticity)\nas $\\nu \\to 0$ (analogously nonsmooth vorticity has been observed in the 2D stationary \nKolmogorov flow for small $\\nu$ \\cite{o96}).\nIts peak value and width scale with $\\nu^{-0.2}$ and $\\nu^{0.6}$, leading\nto the enstrophy dissipation rate independent on $\\nu$.\n\\begin{figure} \n\\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{spc_det_revised.ps}\n \\caption{\\label{statio}(Color online) The energy spectra of the stationary solutions \nto the gDG equation with the deterministic forcing for various $\\nu$'s. \nThe squares represent data (multiplied by $20$) of the randomly forced case \nwith $\\nu_0 / 8$ shown in Fig.\\ref{spec}.\n\\textit{Left inset}: the logarithmic local slopes of the energy spectra and\nEq.(\\ref{a}) as the dashed line.\n\\textit{Right inset}: the vorticity pulses of the stationary solutions.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe identity of the energy spectrum of the stationary solution \nto that of the gDG turbulence in the IR implies \nthat the functional form of the turbulent $E(k)$ can be studied with \nthe stationary solution. \nIn the left inset of Fig.\\ref{statio}, we plot\nthe plateau-less logarithmic local slope of $E(k)$, indicating\nno pure power law in the IR. \nWe then make the following ansatz in the IR, \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n \\frac{\\ln \\frac{E(k + \\Delta k)}{E(k)}}\n  {\\ln \\frac{k + \\Delta k}{k}}\n  \\simeq \nk \\frac{d}{dk} \\ln E(k)\n  = -c_0 -
