The tail part of the wave-function of the  loosely bound neutron is highly sensitive to this virtual photon.   \nHence due to this interaction the valence neutron moves from bound state to the continuum, while core behaves as a spectator.\nThus the nucleus breaks up into a neutron and the core. The electromagnetic breakup of loosely bound nuclei in energetic \nheavy ion collisions is dominated by dipole excitation due to smaller effective charge for higher multi-polarities \\cite{bar01}.\nThus one neutron removal differential Coulomb dissociation cross section (CD)  for dipole excitations d$\\sigma$/dE${^*}$ \ndecomposes into an incoherent sum of components   d$\\sigma (I^{\\pi}_c$)/dE$^{*}$ corresponding to different core states \n$(I^{\\pi}_c)$, populated after one neutron removal.\n For each core state, the cross-section further decomposes into incoherent sum over contribution\nfrom different angular momenta j of the valence neutron in its initial state.

The  invariant mass spectra of those nuclei have been \nobtained through  measurement of  the four-momentum of all decay products after Coulomb excitation on a  $^{208}Pb$ target at\nenergies  of 400-430 MeV/nucleon using FRS-ALADIN-LAND setup at GSI, Darmstadt. Integrated Coulomb-dissociation cross-sections  (CD) \n of  89 $(7)$ mb and 167 $(13)$ mb up to excitation energy of 10 MeV  for one neutron removal from $^{29}$Na and $^{30}$Na respectively,\n have been extracted. The major part of one neutron removal,  CD cross-sections  of those nuclei populate core, in its' ground state.\nA comparison  with the direct breakup model,  suggests the predominant occupation of the valence neutron in the ground state of \n $^{29}$Na${(3/2^+)}$ and $^{30}$Na${(2^+)}$ is  the $d$ orbital with small contribution in the $s$-orbital  which are   coupled with \nground state of the core. The  ground state configurations of these nuclei are  as $^{28}$Na$_{gs}(1^+)\\otimes\\nu_{s,d}$ and \n$^{29}$Na$_{gs}(3/2^+)\\otimes\\nu_{ s,d}$, respectively. The ground state spin and  parity of these nuclei, obtained from this experiment\n are in agreement with earlier reported values. The spectroscopic factors for the valence neutron occupying the $s$ and $d$ \norbitals for these nuclei in the ground state have been  extracted and reported for the first time. A comparison of the experimental \nfindings with the shell model calculation using MCSM suggests a lower limit of around 4.3 MeV of the sd-pf shell gap in $^{30}$Na. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{2pc}\n\\noindent{\\it Keywords}:  neutron-rich nuclei, island of inversion, radioactive ion beam, Coulomb breakup, ground state configuration, spectroscopic factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{}\nThe magic numbers  \\cite{my49,jn49} of the nuclei are a benchmark of nuclear structure.\nThe underlying shell gap is the characteristic of the mean nuclear field  which\nconsists of many ingredients of the nucleon-nucleon interactions. \nThe modification in the shell gaps through the effects such as the tensor component of the NN force become \npronounced with large neutron-proton asymmetries in the exotic nuclei far away from stability.\n These lead to the disappearance of established magic numbers and the appearance of new ones.\nThe first observation of the disappearance of the magic number (N=20) was reported,  based on the mass measurements in  \nthe neutron rich $^{31,32}$Na  \\cite{Ref a}. The experimental observation of the higher binding energies \n of these nuclei is a direct consequence of the large deformation \\cite{Ref a}.  Later large deformation was also reported in\nthe ground state of $^{32}$Mg \\cite{Ref b}. This large deformation was explained by considering the intruder effects \nwhich suggests a clear vanishing of the shell gap  between $sd$ and $pf$ shell around  N =$20$. \nThe N=$20$ isotones with Z$\\sim 10-12$ are considered to belong to the ``island of inversion''  \n\\cite{Ref warburton} where the intruder configurations  dominate the ground state wave function.\nOtsuka et al. considered  strongly attractive monopole interaction of the tensor  force  to describe the shell evolution for \nseveral nuclei \\cite{Ref otsuka}.The attractive $T=0$ monopole interaction between the \n$\\pi$$d_{5/2}$ and $\\nu d_{3/2}$ orbits changes the size of the $N =20$ effective energy gap as the protons fill the $d_{5/2}$ orbitals.\\\\\nThe availability of radioactive ion beams provides an unique opportunity to study the evolution  of the shell structure of the nuclei\nfar away from the $\\beta$-stability line and many experimental observations on the non magicity behavior of \nthe neutron-rich nuclei around 'classic' magic number have been reported.   It is of particular interest to\n understand the shell evolution for the nuclei where transition from the normal ground state configuration\nto the intruder dominated  ground state configuration occurs. The experimental studies in this direction may provide a stringent test for\nthe validation of various theoretical predictions of the nucleon-nucleon interactions. In other words, to understand change of\n nucleon-nucleon interaction, with iso-spin quantum number, the key ingredients are experimental information on ground state configuration \nof these transition nuclei.  So far several studies have been performed  using different techniques to investigate this region \n\\cite{Ref utsuno,Ref c,Ref hurst,mach,Ref tripathi1,Ref tripathi2,doo13}. Though it is established that  valence neutron(s) \nin the ground state of the neutron-rich Na, Mg, Ne isotopes at N = 20, are occupying pf intruder orbitals, but it is not well\n established for the neighboring nuclei. The ground state configuration of transitional nuclei from normal \nto ``island of inversion'' and experimental information for  the transitional nuclei  are often contradictory to each other. \nTerry et al. \\cite{terry} observed $pf$ orbital occupation of valence neutron in the ground state of  neutron-rich $^{28,30}$Ne \n(N=18, 20) via  knockout measurements. However, the situation is different  for $^{30}$Mg (N=18). Both knockout \\cite{mg1} and\n Coulomb excitation data \\cite{mg2} are in agreement  with $sd$-shell ground state configuration of this nucleus.\n No detailed ground state configurations of $^{29,30}$Na (N=18,19)  is available in the literature.    \n The low-energy level structure of the exotic   $^{28,29}$Na isotopes have been investigated through \n$\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ spectroscopy \\cite{Ref tripathi1} and the authors proposed that around $\\sim$ 42 $\\%$ intruder configuration\n  in the ground state of $^{29}$Na \\cite{Ref utsuno} is necessary to explain experimental data. \nSeveral theoretical model calculations and experimental results \\cite{Ref utsuno, Ref c, Ref hurst, Ref tripathi1,Ref tripathi2,isol} suggest \na significant reduction  of the $sd-pf$ shell gap and the ground state of  $^{29,30}$Na are   dominated by intruder states.\n $^{30}$Na has been investigated using Coulomb excitation at the intermediate energies\n\\cite{Ref c} and  transition probability $B(E2: 2^+\\rightarrow 3^+) = 147(21)$ $e^2$ $fm^4$ was reported.\n The Knockout reaction by Tajes et al. \\cite{taj} showed that the momentum distributions of both $^{29,30}$Na are almost identical  \n(137 MeV/c and 130 MeV/c respectively) although $^{29}$Na (S$_n$ = 4.4 MeV) is much deeply bound than $^{30}$Na (S$_n$ = 2.27 MeV). \nThis unconventional experimental observation  encourage for more experimental investigation.\n An experimental program (GSI:s306) has been initiated to explore the ground state configurations of the  neutron-rich nuclei\n around N $\\sim$ 20 via direct probes at GSI, Darmstadt. The Coulomb break up is a direct method to probe the quantum number \nof the valence nucleon of loosely  bound nuclei \\cite{ref e, Ref f,udp,dat2}. \nIn this letter, first results on wave-function decompositions of  the ground state of $^{29,30}$Na, studied  via Coulomb breakup,   \nare being reported.\n\n\\section{Experiment}\n\\label{}\n\n The secondary beam containing  $^{29,30}$Na isotopes along with others were populated by fragmentation of the $^{40}$Ar\n primary beam with energy 540 MeV/nucleon and separated  at FRS \\cite{frs}.  The incoming projectiles were \n identified event-by-event  by measuring the magnetic rigidity,  time of flight and relative energy loss of the exotic nuclei.\nThe incoming beam-identification plot  is shown in Figure \\ref{inc1}. The beam intensity of $^{29,30}$Na were around 14$\\% , \n5.5\\%$ respectively, of total incoming beam.\n\n \n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{inc1.eps}\n\\caption{Identification plot for mixed radioactive beam impinging on secondary targets.}\n\\label{inc1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n The secondary beam  (Figure \\ref{inc1}) was  transported to the experimental site, \na neighboring cave C where the complete kinematic measurements were performed using  the FRS-ALADIN-LAND setup.\n The position of the  incoming beam before the secondary target and  the position of the reaction fragments after the target \n were accurately measured using double sided Silicon strip detectors (DSSD). The target was surrounded by\n162 NaI(Tl) detectors \\cite{metag}, which cover almost $4\\pi$ solid angle. This detector-array was used for detecting the\n $\\gamma$-rays from the excited core of the projectile after the Coulomb breakup.\n After reaction at the secondary target the reaction fragments as well as the unreacted beam were bent by a Large Dipole \nMagnet (ALADIN) and ultimately were detected at the time of flight\nwall detector (TFW) via two scintillator detectors  GFI \\cite{gfi1,gfi}. Out going fragments charge distribution\ncan be obtained  through the energy loss at TOF and silicon strip detector (DSSD). Figure \\ref{outz} shows the charge distribution\nof out going fragments. The decay product, neutrons were forward focused due to Lorentz boost and  detected by the Large Area \nNeutron Detector (LAND) \\cite{land}  for the time of flight and position measurements.\n The reaction fragments were bent at different angles inside ALADIN depending on their  charge to mass ratios.\n This relative deflection angle was measured using the GFI detectors placed at two different distances at an angle of $15^0$ from the\noriginal beam direction after the ALADIN. The mass of  the outgoing reaction fragments was reconstructed\nusing the deflection angles measured from GFI, the energy loss at TFW, and the time of flight measurement\nof the reaction fragments. Figure \\ref{outmass} represents the  mass  of the outgoing fragment against velocity, after one neutron breakup\nof $^{29}$Na.

This nucleus can be considered as a core and loosely bound neutron and the \ncalculation for CD cross-section using the direct breakup model  \\cite{ref e}  have been performed using various valence\nneutron occupying orbitals. The out going neutron in the continuum is approximated by  a plane-wave.\n To understand the valence  neutron occupation orbital with probability, the experimental \nCoulomb Dissociation cross-section d$\\sigma (I^{\\pi}_c$)/dE$^{*}$ of $^{29}$Na  into  ground state of $^{28}$Na and \none neutron  have been  compared with direct breakup model calculation.  All experimental  d$\\sigma$/dE$^{*}$ distributions are \nshown in figures without  acceptance and efficiency corrections\n for the neutron detector.

But no detailed \nmeasurement on  ground state configuration is available.  $\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy data \\cite{Ref hurst, Ref tripathi1,Ref tripathi2,isol}\n were interpreted  as  intruder dominated ground state configuration.  Present experimental \nCD cross sections of $^{29,30}$Na along with the  calculated  one from the direct breakup model\nhave been summarized in the table \\ref{tab:1}. The  Coulomb breakup calculation  are compared with\nthe experimental findings.  The dominant ground state configuration of  $^{29}$Na is $^{28}$Na$_{gs}(1^+)\\otimes\\nu_{s,d}$.\n The ground state spin and parity of $^{29}$Na from this experiment  favor 1$^+ \\otimes$1/2$^+$ i.e, either 3/2$^+$ or  1/2$^+$. \nA comparison between the spectroscopic factors obtained from this experimental data with shell model calculations  using \nvarious interaction have been presented in the   table \\ref{tab:1}. In USD-B calculation the valence space is composed of the \n$sd$ shell for both protons and  neutrons.  For $sdpf$-M,  the valence space is composed of the $sd$ shell for protons  and   \nallows mixing between   $sd$ and $pf$ shell orbitals for neutrons. The Hamiltonian has been recently introduced \\cite{er shell}. \nThe calculated spectroscopic factors are given in table \\ref{tab:1}.  Both USD-B \\cite{brown} shell model calculation, and  \nMCSM shell model calculations \\cite{Ref utsuno} favor 3/2$^+$ as the ground state spin and parity of $^{29}$Na. This is in agreement \nwith the earlier experimentally measured value \\cite{huber}. \nUtsuno et al., \\cite{Ref utsuno} showed that  the measured two neutron separation energy, magnetic and electric moments of\n$^{29}$Na can be  explained by both USD and $sdpf$-M. The excited core contributions in their ground state configuration are \naround $\\sim28(5)\\%$ as per our experimental  observation for  $^{29}$Na isotopes and  the core  excited state \ncontribution above 2.0 MeV is around 12$\\%$.  To a simple approximation, if this amount is considered  wholly due to  $2p-2h$ \nconfigurations, then according to MCSM \\cite{Ref utsuno} calculations, one can obtain  4.8 MeV as lower limit of the $sd-pf$ shell \ngap in $^{29}$Na. It is clear from Figure \\ref{all_fit}b that the experimental spectroscopic factor for the valence neutron in the $d$ \norbital coupled with $^{28}$Na$_{gs}(1^+)$ is  2.08 $( 0.3)$  and this is in good agreement with\nUSD-B shell model calculation (2.18).  Measured mass of $^{29}$Na can be explained by sd-shell model calculation \\cite{wild}.\n\n The ground state spin and parity of $^{30}$Na has been measured earlier as being 2$^+$ \\cite{huber} and this value can be reproduced by both \n USD \\cite{brown} shell model and MCSM shell model calculations \\cite{Ref utsuno}.  No experimental data on ground state configuration of \nthis nucleus is available.  To explain measured reduced matrix element of this isotope, it has been considered that the ground state is pure\ntwo-particle-two-hole deformed ground state \\cite{isol}. But  present experimental data favors  $^{29}Na_{gs}(3/2^+)\\otimes\\nu_{s,d}$ as \nmajor ground state configuration  of $^{30}$Na (N=19)  and  the core $^{29}$Na excited state contribution  i.e, particle hole \nconfigurations in the ground state is around 42 $(6)$ mb (25$(4)\\%$ of total CD cross-section). If it is  approximated that the excited \nstates contributions are  entirely due to  $2p-2h$ configurations then a comparison of our experimental findings with shell-model \ncalculation  using the MCSM  \\cite{Ref utsuno} suggests a  lower limit of $sd-pf$ shell gap, around 4.3 MeV in this nucleus.  \nFor the first time experimental  quantitative spectroscopic  factors of valence neutron in the $s$ and $d$ orbital   have been measured.\nUnlike, $^{29}$Na, for $^{30}$Na, the experimental spectroscopic  factor for occupation of $d$-orbital (2.03)\n deviates from $sd$-shell (USD-B) calculation (2.97).  Hence reduced spectroscopic factor of valence neutron occupying \n$d$-orbital could be due to particle hole configuration across the reduced sd-pf shell gap. \nSince ground state spin and parity of this neutron-rich nucleus is 2$^+$, the valence neutron occupying $pf$ orbital, should be coupled with \nnegative parity excited states of $^{29}$Na. So far very little is  known about the excited states of $^{29}$Na. On the other hand,\n Coulomb breakup cross-section using direct breakup model for valence neutron in f$_{7/2}$ orbital coupled with \ncore excited state of 1.5 MeV is around 21 mb and  it further reduced to 10 mb when coupled with 3.0 MeV \nexcited core state. When valence neutron is occupying $p$ orbital, the direct breakup model calculation for same situation is\n108 mb and 67 mb, respectively. Considering experimental excited state CD cross-section, 42 $( 6 )$mb, it may be possible\n that valence neutron across the shell gap is occupying either pure $f$  or $p$ orbital or mixing of $p$ and $f$ orbital.\n \nIn a nut-shell,  present experimental data of Coulomb breakup suggests that ground state properties of $^{29}$Na can be \nexplained by USD-B shell model calculation. But the situation is different for that of $^{30}$Na. The spectroscopic factor for \nvalence neutron in $d$ orbital is  almost 1/3 reduced compared to USD-B calculation. This could be tentatively, for particle\n hole configuration  across the shell gap and valence neutron may occupy either   $f$ or $p$ orbital or mixing of both $pf$ \norbital. Thus, it may be concluded that boundary of ``island of inversion'' has been started from $^{30}$Na, instead of $^{29}$Na. \nWildenthal et al. \\cite{wild}, showed that measured mass of $^{29}$Na  can be explained by USD shell model calculation  \n  but the same for  $^{30}$Na  was not fully reproduced by sd-shell model calculation.\nThe  measured B(E2; 2$^+ \\rightarrow 3^+)$  value  for  $^{30}$Na \\cite{Ref c, Ref cp} is  around 30$\\%$ lower\nthan the  value calculated by MCSM with the $sdpf$-M interaction.  However more details theoretical calculation is necessary to \nunderstand nucleon-nucleon interaction for this neutron-rich nuclei near ``island of inversion''. \n  \n\\section{Conclusion}\nFirst results on Coulomb breakup measurements of the neutron-rich  $^{29,30}$Na  nuclei, at\nenergies of 400-430 MeV/nucleon has been reported. The observed low-lying dipole strength in these\n neutron-rich Na isotopes can be understood as a direct-breakup mechanism and no resonance like structure has been observed.\nThe shape of the experimental  differential Coulomb dissociation cross section and its comparison with the calculated\ncross section  suggests  the predominant ground-state configuration  as $^{28}$Na${(1^+)}\\otimes\\nu_{s,d}$ and\n$^{29}$Na${(3/2^+)}\\otimes\\nu_{ s,d}$ for $^{29}$Na and $^{30}$Na  respectively. The  ground state spin and \nparity of these nuclei, obtained from present measurement  are in agreement with earlier reported values.\nThus the first results on ground state configurations and qualitative spectroscopic information of valence neutron\n occupying the $s$, $d$ orbitals, obtained via direct method have been reported in this letter. According to this experimental\nresults, the valence neutron is occupying mainly $d$ orbital for both the neutron-rich Na nuclei (N=18,19).\nBut experimentally obtained  spectroscopic factor (2.08 $( 0.3$ for valence neutron in $d$ orbital  of $^{29}$Na  \nis in closer agreement with modified  $sd$-shell (USD-B) calculation (2.18). On the other hand the same for $^{30}$Na  \nis different and experimentally obtained spectroscopic factor for valence neutron in $d$ orbital is much reduced \n2.03 $( 0.3)$  compared to  sd-shell (USD-B) calculation (2.97). This could be due to particle-hole excitation\nof the valence neutron across the shell-gap.  A comparison of our experimental findings on the core \nexcited states contributions in the ground state configuration with the shell-model calculation using the MCSM suggests a \nlower limit of the $sd-pf$ shell gap in $^{30}$Na of around 4.3 MeV. Thus present experimental data  pointed that   $^{30}$Na \n is the boundary of ``island  of inversion'', instead of $^{29}$Na. However more detail theoretical calculation is necessary to \nunderstand the nucleon-nucleon interaction for this neutron-rich nuclei near ``island  of inversion''.\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\nWe are thankful to the accelerator people of GSI for their active support during the experiment.

The neutron-rich nucleus around N = 20,  \nhas been considered as a combination of the  core and a loosely bound valence neutron which may occupy one or more \norbitals e.g. $s$, $d$, $p$ etc.. \nWhen the  projectile passes by a high Z target it  may be excited by absorbing the  virtual photons from the time dependent Coulomb \nfield \\cite{bar88}. The tail part of the wave-function of the  loosely bound neutron is highly sensitive to this virtual photon.   \nHence due to this interaction the valence neutron moves from bound state to the continuum, while core behaves as a spectator.\nThus the nucleus breaks up into a neutron and the core. The electromagnetic breakup of loosely bound nuclei in energetic \nheavy ion collisions is dominated by dipole excitation due to smaller effective charge for higher multi-polarities \\cite{bar01}.\nThus one neutron removal differential Coulomb dissociation cross section (CD)  for dipole excitations d$\\sigma$/dE${^*}$ \ndecomposes into an incoherent sum of components   d$\\sigma (I^{\\pi}_c$)/dE$^{*}$ corresponding to different core states \n$(I^{\\pi}_c)$, populated after one neutron removal.\n For each core state, the cross-section further decomposes into incoherent sum over contribution\nfrom different angular momenta j of the valence neutron in its initial state. Thus differential  cross-section  of  $^{29,30}$Na \ncan be expressed through the following equation \\cite{ref e}:\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\n\\frac{d\\sigma (I^{\\pi}_c)}{dE^*}=\\ \\frac{16\\pi^3}{9\\hbar c}N_{E1}(E^*)\\displaystyle\\sum_j C^2S(I^{\\pi}_c,nlj)\n \\\\\\times \\displaystyle\\sum_m|<q|(Ze/A)rY^l_m|\\psi_{nlj}(r)>|^2 \\\n\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\par&#10;\\frac{d\\sigma(I^{\\pi}_{c})}{dE^{*}}=\\ \\frac{16\\pi^{3}}{9\\hbar c}N_{E1}(E^%&#10;{*})\\displaystyle\\sum_{j}C^{2}S(I^{\\pi}_{c},nlj)\\\\&#10;\\times\\displaystyle\\sum_{m}|&lt;q|(Ze/A)rY^{l}_{m}|\\psi_{nlj}(r)&gt;|^{2}\\ \\par&#10;\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>I</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>\u03c0</mi></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>E</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo rspace=\"7.5pt\">=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>\u03c0</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><mrow><mn>9</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u210f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi>E</mi><mo>*</mo></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>j</mi></munder><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>C</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>I</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>\u03c0</mi></msubsup><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>m</mi></munder><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>q</mi><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>Z</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>Y</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>l</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c8</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
