In addition, we found a new non-toxic DMS Mn-doped BaZn$_2$Sb$_2$, of which the Curie temperature T$_c$ is predicted to be higher \nthan that of Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$, the T$_c$ of which was up to 230 K in the recent experiment. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\pacs{75.50.Pp, 75.30.Hx, 02.70.Ss} \\maketitle\n\nAfter the discovery of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)As, diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) have received considerable attention owing to potential applications based on the use of both their charge and spin degrees of freedom in electronic devices \\cite{Ohno,Dietl}. Thus far, the highest Curie temperature of (Ga,Mn)As has \nbeen T$_c$ = 190 K \\cite{Wang}. The substitution of divalent Mn atoms into trivalent Ga sites introduces hole carriers; thus, (Ga,Mn)As is a p-type DMS. The valence mismatch between Mn and Ga leads to severely limited chemical solubility for Mn in GaAs. Moreover, owing to simultaneous doping of charge and spin induced by Mn substitution, it is difficult to individually optimize charge and spin densities. \n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a new type of DMS, i.e., Li(Zn,Mn)As was proposed \\cite{Masek} and later fabricated with T$_c$ = 50 K \\cite{Deng-LiZnAs}. It is based on LiZnAs, a I$-$II$-$V semiconductor. Spin is introduced by isovalent (Zn$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$) substitution, which is decoupled from carrier doping with excess/deficient Li concentration. Although Li(Zn,Mn)As was proposed as a promising n-type DMS with excess Li$^+$,\np-type carriers were obtained in the experiment with excess Li. The introduction of holes was presumably because of the excess Li$^+$ in substitutional Zn$^{2+}$ sites \\cite{Deng-LiZnAs}. Later, another I$-$II$-$V DMS, i.e., Li(Zn,Mn)P was reported in an experiment with T$_c$ = 34 K \\cite{Deng-LiZnP}. \nLi(Zn,Mn)P with excess Li was determined to be of p-type as well in the experiment. According to first-principles calculations, the reason for this is the same as that for Li(Zn,Mn)As \\cite{Deng-LiZnP}. Although such p-type I$-$II$-$V DMSs have a few distinct advantages over (Ga,Mn)As, the achievable T$_c$ is much lower than that of (Ga,Mn)As. \n\nAnother type of DMS (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)$_2$As$_2$ was observed in experiments with T$_c$ up to 230 K \\cite{Zhao-180,Zhao-230}, which is higher than that for (Ga,Mn)As. Based on the semiconductor BaZn$_2$As$_2$, holes were doped by (Ba$^{2+}$, K$^+$) substitutions, and spins by isovalent (Zn$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$) substitutions. It was a p-type DMS. Motivated by the high T$_c$, density functional theory (DFT) calculations \\cite{Glasbrenner} and photoemission spectroscopy experiments \\cite{Suzuki-1,Suzuki-2} were conducted to understand the microscopic mechanism of ferromagnetism of p-type DMS (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)$_2$As$_2$.\nBy contrast, an n-type DMS, i.e., Ba(Zn,Mn,Co)$_2$As$_2$ was recently reported in an experiment with T$_c$ $\\sim$ 80 K \\cite{Man}. In this material, electrons are doped because of the substitution of Zn with Co, and spins are generated mainly because of (Zn$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$) substitutions. \n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\includegraphics[width = 8.5 cm]{bazn2as2_fig1.ps}\n\\caption{ (Color online) Schematic pictures of impurity bound state (IBS) and ferromagnetic (FM) coupling in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS). \n(a) Host bands $\\epsilon (k)$ with a wide band gap $\\Delta_{\\text{g}}$ between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB).

Why is T$_c$ much lower in the n-type case than that in p-type case? In general, can p- and n-type DMS be realized? The answers will be helpful for fabricating spin p-n junctions in the future. In this study, we attempt to address such issues. In previous studies on DMS materials with wide band gap $\\Delta_{\\text{g}}$, we found that the position of the IBS $\\omega_{\\text{IBS}}$ was close to the top of the VB owing to the strong mixing between the impurity and the VB, and usually no IBS appeared below the bottom of the CB because of weak mixing between the impurity and the CB \\cite{Gu-ZnO,Ohe-GaAs,Gu-MgO}. \nThus, we have 0 $\\lesssim$ $\\omega_{\\text{IBS}}$ $\\ll$ $\\Delta_{\\text{g}}$, as shown in Fig. \\ref{F-schematic}(a). \nThe magnetic correlation $\\langle M_1^zM_2^z\\rangle$ between two impurities\nwith FM coupling (positive $\\langle M_1^zM_2^z\\rangle$) can be determined when the chemical potential $\\mu$ is tuned to be close to the IBS: $\\mu$ $\\sim$ $\\omega_{\\text{IBS}}$ \\cite{Ichimura,Bulut,Tomoda}. Therefore, for p-type carriers ($\\mu$ $\\sim$ 0), FM coupling can be obtained as $\\mu$ $\\sim$ $\\omega_{\\text{IBS}}$, \nand for n-type carriers ($\\mu$ $\\sim$ $\\Delta_{\\text{g}}$), no magnetic coupling is obtained between impurities because $\\mu$ $\\gg$ $\\omega_{\\text{IBS}}$. \nA schematic diagram describing p-type DMS materials with a wide band gap, \nincluding (Zn,Mn)O \\cite{Gu-ZnO}, (Ga,Mn)As \\cite{Ohe-GaAs}, and Mg(O,N) \\cite{Gu-MgO},\nis shown in Fig. \\ref{F-schematic} (b).\n\nHere, we propose a method for realizing p- and n-type DMS. \nThe key is choosing host semiconductors with a narrow band gap $\\Delta_{\\text {g}}$. \nBy selecting suitable host semiconductors and impurities, the condition 0 $\\lesssim$ $\\omega_{\\text{IBS}}$ $\\lesssim$ $\\Delta_{\\text{g}}$ is satisfied, \nas shown in Fig. \\ref{F-schematic}(c). \nWe show that for both the p-type ($\\mu\\sim 0$) and the n-type ($\\mu \\sim \\Delta_{\\text{g}}$) cases, the condition for developing FM coupling,\nthat is $\\mu$ $\\sim$ $\\omega_{\\text{IBS}}$, can be fulfilled, as shown in Fig. \\ref{F-schematic}(d).\n \nIn the following, we realistically calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$ DMS, \nwhich has narrow band gap $\\Delta_{\\text{g}}$ (= 0.2 eV) \\cite{Zhao-180}. \nWe use a combination of the DFT \\cite {DFT-1, DFT-2} \nand the Hirsch$-$Fye quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation \\cite{QMC}.\nOur combined DFT+QMC method can be used for in-depth treatment of the band structures of materials and strong electron correlations \nof magnetic impurities on an equal footing; thus, it can be applied for designing new functional semiconductor- \\cite {Gu-ZnO,Ohe-GaAs,Gu-MgO} \nand metal-based \\cite{Gu-AuFe,Gu-AuPt,Xu-CuIr} materials.\nThe method involves two calculations steps. \nFirst, the Haldane$-$Anderson impurity model \\cite{Haldane} \nis formulated within the local density approximation for determining the host band\nstructure and impurity-host mixing. Second, magnetic\ncorrelations of the Haldane-Anderson impurity model at finite\ntemperatures are calculated using the Hirsch$-$Fye QMC technique \\cite{QMC}. \n \nThe Haldane$-$Anderson impurity model is defined as follows:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  H &=&\n  \\sum_{\\textbf{k},\\alpha,\\sigma}[\\epsilon_{\\alpha}(\\textbf{k})-\\mu]\n  c^{\\dag}_{\\textbf{k}\\alpha\\sigma}c_{\\textbf{k}\\alpha\\sigma} \n  +\\sum_{\\textbf{k},\\alpha,\\textbf{i},\\xi,\\sigma}(V_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\textbf{k}\\alpha }\n d^{\\dag}_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma} c_{\\textbf{k}\\alpha\\sigma} \\notag\\\\\n   &+& h.c.) + (\\epsilon_d-\\mu)\\sum_{\\textbf{i},\\xi,\\sigma}\n   d^{\\dag}_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma}d_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma}\n   + U\\sum_{\\textbf{i},\\xi}n_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\uparrow}n_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\downarrow},\n   \\label{E-Ham}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $c^{\\dag}_{\\textbf{k}\\alpha\\sigma}$\n($c_{\\textbf{k}\\alpha\\sigma}$) is the creation (annihilation)\noperator for a host electron with wave vector $\\textbf{k}$ and spin\n$\\sigma$ in the VB ($\\alpha = v$) or the CB ($\\alpha = c$), and $d^{\\dag}_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma}$\n($d_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma}$) is the creation (annihilation) operator\nfor a localized electron at impurity site $\\textbf{i}$ in orbital\n$\\xi$ and spin $\\sigma$ with\n$n_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma}=d^{\\dag}_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma}d_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\sigma}$.\nHere, $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}(\\textbf{k})$ is the host band dispersion,\n$\\mu$ is the chemical potential, $V_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\textbf{k}\\alpha}$\ndenotes mixing between the impurity and the host, $\\epsilon_d$ is the\nimpurity $3d$ orbital energy, and $U$ is the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion of the impurity. For simplicity, we neglect Hund coupling. \n\nThe parameters $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}(\\textbf{k})$ and $V_{\\textbf{i}\\xi\\textbf{k}\\alpha}$\nare obtained by DFT calculations using the Wien2k package \\cite{Wien2k},\nthe details of which are shown in the Supplemental Material \\cite{Supp}.\nThe parameters $U$ and $\\epsilon_d$ are determined as follows. \nFor (Ga,Mn)As, the reasonable parameters are estimated as \n$U$ = 4 eV and $\\epsilon_d$ = -2 eV \\cite{Ohe-GaAs}.\nA recent resonance photoemission spectroscopy experiment showed that the Mn $3d$ partial density of states \nin (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)$_2$As$_2$ and (Ga,Mn)As are quite similar, excepted that the peak of (Ga,Mn)As is approximately 0.4 eV deeper \nthan that of (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)$_2$As$_2$ \\cite{Suzuki-1}. \nThus, the reasonable parameters of Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$ are $U$ = 4 eV and $\\epsilon_d$ = -1.5 eV.  \nOn the basis of the parameters obtained above, magnetic correlations of the impurities are calculated using the Hirsch$-$Fye QMC\ntechnique with more than 10$^{6}$ Monte Carlo sweeps and a Matsubara time step $\\Delta\\tau$ = 0.25.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics[width = 8.5 cm]{bazn2as2_fig2.eps}\n\\caption{ (Color online) For Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$, chemical potential $\\mu$ dependence of (a) occupation number $\\langle n_{\\xi}\\rangle$ \nof $\\xi$ orbital of an Mn impurity, \nand (b) magnetic correlation $\\langle M_{1\\xi}^zM_{2\\xi}^z\\rangle$ between the $\\xi$ orbitals of two Mn impurities with fixed distance \n$R_{12}$ = 2.91 \\AA (the 1st nearest neighbor), where the temperature is 360 K.

Considering Hund coupling, which was ignored in the calculations for simplicity, all five $3d$ orbitals of the Mn impurity can have long-range FM coupling. Thus, our theoretical results are consistent with the FM observed in the experiment involving Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$ with p-type carriers.  \n\nFor Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$ with n-type carriers, a recent experiment showed FM coupling below T$_c$ = 80 K \\cite{Man}. Because no information about the Fermi level has been reported, we take $\\mu$ = 0.15 eV as an estimate for the n-type case, which is below the bottom of the CB by 0.05 eV. As shown in Fig. \\ref{F-c2} (b), \nlong-range FM coupling up to approximately 6 \\AA (the 3rd nearest neighbor) is obtained for the orbitals $\\xi$ = $xz$ and $yz$. No FM is obtained for the other three orbitals, shown in Fig. \\ref{F-ibs} (b) as well.

Long-range FM coupling up to approximately 10 \\AA (the 14th nearest neighbor) was obtained for the $\\xi$ = $xz$, $yz$, $x^2-y^2$ and $z^2$ orbitals, while relatively short-range FM coupling is obtained for the $xy$ orbital. Considering Hund coupling, which is ignored in the calculations, \nall five $3d$ orbitals of the Mn impurity can have long-range FM coupling up to approximately 10 \\AA (the 14th nearest neighbor). This is considerably longer than 6 \\AA (the 3rd nearest neighbor) obtained for Mn doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$ with p-type carriers, as shown in Fig. \\ref{F-c2} (a). Such long-range FM coupling arises from the short distance between the neighboring Zn sites in BaZn$_2$Sb$_2$, as is clear from comparison of the 1st and 2nd and 3rd nearest neighbors in Fig. \\ref{F-c2}(a) and those neighbors in Fig. \\ref{F-c2-bazn2sb2}(a), respectively.  \nWe predict that the T$_c$ of Mn-doped BaZn$_2$Sb$_2$ with p-type carriers should be higher than that of Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$ with p-type carriers, in which \n T$_c$ = 230 K was reported in a recent experiment \\cite{Zhao-230}. \n\nFor Mn-doped BaZn$_2$Sb$_2$ with n-type carriers, we take $\\mu$ = 0.15 eV, the same value as that used for Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$ with n-type carriers. As shown in Fig. \\ref{F-c2-bazn2sb2} (b), no stable magnetic couplings were obtained for the 2nd and 3rd nearest neighbors owing to large error bars; thus, there was no \nlong-range FM coupling. This is because $\\mu$ = 0.15 eV is slightly far from the IBS position of the $xz$ orbital, \nwhich is approximately -0.2 eV, as shown in Fig. \\ref{F-ibs-bazn2sb2} (a).  \n\nIn summary, we have proposed a method to realize DMS with p- and n-type carriers by choosing host semiconductors with a narrow band gap. \nUsing the combined method of DFT and QMC, we describe DMS Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$,\nwhich has a narrow band gap of 0.2 eV. In addition, we find a new non-toxic DMS Mn-doped BaZn$_2$Sb$_2$, whose T$_c$ is expected to be higher \nthan that of Mn-doped BaZn$_2$As$_2$, for which T$_c$ = 230 K, as reported in a recent experiment.\n    \nThe authors acknowledge H.
