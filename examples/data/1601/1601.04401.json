It will be interesting to understand and revisit in detail, the difference in the reaction mechanisms using a tightly, weakly and unbound or halo nuclei. Very recently, a phenomenological comparison of reduced reaction cross sections of different reaction systems was proposed by using Wong\u00a1\u00afs model \\cite{bibitem1,bibitem2,bibitem3}. Several authors have extracted the quarter-point angle from the elastic scattering angular distribution reaction cross section, in order to compare the weakly and tightly bound projectiles \\cite{bibitem4,bibitem5,bibitem6}. The quarter point angle which is also called the \u00a1\u00b0grazing angle\u00a1\u00b1 or \u00a1\u00b0rainbow angle\u00a1\u00b1 is one of the most conspicuous features of heavy-ion elastic scattering at above-barrier energies. Additionally, the sum of projectile and target radius is approximately equal to the classical apsidal distance or the distance of closest approach, evaluated at the energy for which the experimental cross section is one-quarter of the corresponding Rutherford cross section \\cite{bibitem7}.\n\nIn the strong absorption model, the strong interaction region has been expressed by assuming a diffused edge with respect to the impact parameter and also by taking sharp cutoff angular momentum \\cite{bibitem8}. The strong absorption radius $R_{s}$ has been introduced within the framework of the quarter-point angle that is the angle that separates the classically allowed region in angular range smaller than this angle from the classically forbidden region beyond it.\n\nExperimentally, the nuclear radius (or nuclear matter distribution) can be determined by the measurement of electron scattering, isotope shift and interaction cross section etc. Since the electron is structure less and the electromagnetic interaction is very well known, therefore the charge distribution of a nucleus can be precisely obtained from the electron scattering measurements. The proton distribution can be deduced from the nuclear charge distribution in the case of stable nuclei. However, for an unstable nuclei being short-lived and difficult to use as a target, especially for the halo nuclei, one usually uses the isotope method or interaction cross section measurements to determine the size of nucleus. To be more precise, one can say that electron scattering is better than isotope shift and isotope shift is better than interaction cross section. Moreover the interaction cross section is much model dependent. From Fig.1, we can clearly see that the nuclear size is obviously correlated to the quarter-point angle. This is because x is a function of $R_{s}$, a kind of nuclear radius which is simply expressed as $A_{p}^{1/3} + A_{t}^{1/3}$. This indicates that we may extract the radius of unstable nuclei from the experimental quarter-point angle. This could be a new experimental method to determine the nuclear size.\n\nAs introduced above, the strong absorption radius can be extracted from the quarter-point angle through the elastic scattering angular distribution of the reacting system. Based on the concept of quarter-point angle, the main objective of this work is to compare the tightly, weakly bound (stable) and weakly bound (unstable) projectiles using the phenomenological formula for strong absorption radius. This difference of the three kinds of projectiles can be employed to find a better understanding of the strong absorption radius. Furthermore, nuclear radius can also be obtained from this analysis.\n\n\\section{Phenomenological formulae with parameters for strong absorption radius}\nThe theoretical quarter-point angle described elsewhere \\cite{bibitem6}, \n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\theta_{1/4} = 2\\arcsin{[1/(2x+1)]} \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\theta_{1/4}=2\\arcsin{[1/(2x+1)]}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>arcsin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04401.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13407, "prevtext": " is a function of the dimensionless variable $x$, where $x=E_{cm}/V_{coul}$, the ratio of the center of mass energy $E_{cm}$ to Coulomb barrier $V_{coul}$.

However, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), the quarter point angle values are still inconsistent with respect to the three types of projectiles, although the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical curve show a decrease. Thus the modified formula given by PF3 is not adequate to accurately calculate the nuclear size, especially for the halo nuclei. In order to obtain a consistent description for nuclear size, it is important to discuss this phenomenological formulation with further improvement by considering the binding energy of the nuclei. According to the quantum mechanics, the nuclear rms radius is inversely proportional to the binding energy. The relation between the rms radii and the binding energy can be obtained from the simplified N single-particle Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation as, $R(B)=\\frac{4.04}{\\sqrt{B(A)}} $\\cite{bibitem10}. However, this relation is not sufficient for a good agreement with the experimental data. A modified quantitative formula of the nuclear rms radius as a function of isospin and binding energy per nucleon was introduced and discussed by Wang et al., \\cite{bibitem11}. It is important to take into account the binding energies and based on this fact, the theoretical $R_{s}$ is given by (PF4)\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13500, "prevtext": "\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned}\nR_{i}=((r_{0}+\\frac{r_{1}}{A_{i}^{2/3}}+\\frac{r_{2}}{A_{i}^{4/3}})\n+a_{z}\\frac{Z_{i}-Z_{stable}}{A_{i}})A_{i}^{1/3}; \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3X.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle R_{i}=((r_{0}+\\frac{r_{1}}{A_{i}^{2/3}}+\\frac{r_{2}}{A_{i}^{4/3}%&#10;})+a_{z}\\frac{Z_{i}-Z_{stable}}{A_{i}})A_{i}^{1/3};\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>i</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msubsup></mfrac></mstyle><mo>+</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>i</mi><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msubsup></mfrac></mstyle></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>z</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>Z</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>Z</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>i</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msubsup></mrow></mrow><mo>;</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04401.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13407, "prevtext": " is a function of the dimensionless variable $x$, where $x=E_{cm}/V_{coul}$, the ratio of the center of mass energy $E_{cm}$ to Coulomb barrier $V_{coul}$.

This also clearly indicates that the radius calculated by the expression $A_{p}^{1/3} + A_{t}^{1/3}$ in order to compare the different kinds of projectiles result in the underestimation of the size of weakly bound projectiles, and even more in the case of halo projectiles.\n\nThus the modified expression of $R_{s}$ can lower the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical curve of the quarter-point angle as a function of $x$. In Fig. 3, the result of the modification is shown. When compared with the points in Fig. 2, the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical curve and among the three kinds of projectiles is diminished.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{PF2.pdf}\n \\caption{\\label{Fig_3} (Color online) Same as Fig. 2,  except for phenomenological formula (PF2).}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith the enlightenment of reducing the difference in the quarter point angle values among the three kinds of projectiles by using modified $R_{s}$, it is feasible to find a better phenomenological formula to give a better account of the strong absorption radius. To begin with, the nuclear radius based on the liquid drop model was used. Additionally, nucleon distribution having finite surface thickness was assumed instead of uniform distribution. Considering the isospin symmetry that distinguishes between charged and uncharged particles, affected equally by the nuclear strong force, the improved expression of $R_{s}$ with parameters $r_{0}$, $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$ and $a_{z}$ is given by (PF3) \\cite{bibitem9},\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} R_{s} &=& \\sum_{i=p,t}R_{i} ;  \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4X.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle R_{s}\" display=\"inline\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4X.m3\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=\" display=\"inline\"><mo>=</mo></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4X.m5\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\hskip 10.0pt\\sum_{i=p,t}R_{i};\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" lspace=\"12.5pt\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow></munder></mstyle><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo>;</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04401.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere isospin is given by $ I_{i}=\\frac{A_{i}-2Z_{i}}{A_{i}}$, $ B_{i}$ is the binding energy per nucleon and subscript denotes projectile and target. The experimental data of quarter-point angle were fitted to obtain the parameters $\\lambda_{0}=0.9776 fm$, $\\lambda_{1}=0.2475 fm$, $\\lambda_{2}=-0.1492 fm/MeV^{1/2}$ and $\\lambda_{3}=10.7186 fm/MeV$. The experimental values of binding energy were taken from literature \\cite{bibitem12} and were used to determine $B_{i}$. As a result, the deviation between the experimental and the theoretical curve for all the three types of projectiles (mainly between the tight bound and the halo) were diminished as can be seen in FIG. 4 (b). The goodness of fit for PF3 and PF4 was obtained by square of regression fit (R-Square). R-Square is a number that indicates how well data fit a curve. An R-Square of 1 indicates that the regression line perfectly fitting the data, while an R-Square of 0 the line does not fit the data at all. In the present work R-Square for PF3 is 0.998585 and for PF4 0.9986632. So PF4 shows better fit than PF3. Using the results from the above method and comparing them with the fitted data as shown in FIG. 3, one can emphasize the importance of the binding energy to understand the nuclear size, especially in the case of halo nucleus. For a clear justification, the next section gives a more detailed comparison.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{PF34.pdf}\n \\caption{\\label{Fig_4} (Color online) Theoretical and experimental Quarter point angle values for three types of projectiles using PF3 (a) and PF4 (b). The color points are for the experimental quarter-point angle values. The experimental data were used in the interval of x from 0.8 to 2.0. The theoretical quarter-point angle function is labeled as TQAF.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Comparison of the four phenomenological formulae}\nIn this section, we give a quantitative comparison of the four phenomenological formulae (PF1 to PF4). We define a goodness of fit ratio $\\eta=\\frac{x-x_{PF}}{x_{PF}}$ that will estimate the deviation between the experimental quarter-point angle and the curve of (TQAF). In other words, smaller is the value of $\\eta$, lesser will be the deviation. In this relation $x_{PF}$ is determined by the center-mass energy and the Coulomb barrier via the phenomenological formulae, $x_{PF}=E_{cm}/V_{coul}$. However, $x$ is directly calculated by using the formula (1), namely, using the curve of TQAF. Both $x_{PF}$ and $x$ corresponds to the same quarter-point angle extracted from elastic scattering angular distribution of the reacting systems. The comparison of $\\eta$ in terms of the four phenomenological formulae (PF1 to PF4) is shown in FIG. 5.  It is clear from the figure that the modified formulae PF2, PF3 and PF4 show a better agreement as compared to PF1 so far as the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical curve (TQAF) is concerned. The advantages and disadvantages of the four methods for calculating $R_{s}$ are more clearly understood while comparing the deviation between tightly bound and halo projectiles. This deviation between tightly bound and halo projectiles by the four methods may be more clearly obtained by introducing another parameter $\\triangle{\\eta}=\\overline{\\eta_{H}}-\\overline{\\eta_{TB}}$, where, $\\overline{\\eta_{H}}$ s the arithmetic mean of $\\eta$ for halo nuclei and $\\overline{\\eta_{TB}}$ is that for tightly bound nuclei. In addition, the inconsistency of the experimental points can be found for tightly bound systems with two clear groups (taking FIG. 6 as a sample case) while for the weakly bound systems there is a scattered distribution. We take the case of tightly bound nuclei to explain this feature. Analogically, the exact deviation between $\\overline{\\eta_{1-TB}}$ and $\\overline{\\eta_{2-TB}}$ is given by $\\triangle{\\eta_{TB}}=\\overline{\\eta_{1-TB}}-\\overline{\\eta_{2-TB}}$, where $\\overline{\\eta_{1-TB}}$ is the arithmetic mean of  for the group of experimental quarter-point angle points of tight bound nuclei far from the curve of TQAF and $\\overline{\\eta_{2-TB}}$ is that near to the curve of TQAF. The calculated values of $\\triangle{\\eta}$ and $\\triangle{\\eta_{TB}}$ are shown in TABLE II. From these values, it may be observed that the results given by PF4 show the minimum values for both $\\triangle{\\eta}$ and $\\triangle{\\eta_{TB}}$. Therefore, one can conclude that among all the four phenomenological formulae, PF4 shows by far the best improvement in present work for all the three types of nuclei. Thus in the present work, PF4 is recommended for giving better consistency among tightly bound systems, besides reducing the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical curve of quarter-point angle.\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}\n\n\n\\hline\n & PF1  & PF2 & PF3 & PF4  \\\\\n\\hline\n$\\triangle{\\eta}$ & $0.0374$ & $0.0077$ & $0.0342$ & $0.0059$  \\\\\n$\\triangle{\\eta_{TB}}$ & $0.056$ & $0.040$ & $0.039$ & $0.033$  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{The values of $\\triangle{\\eta}$ and $\\triangle{\\eta_{TB}}$ for PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4. }\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{dx.pdf}\n \\caption{\\label{Fig_5} (Color online) Comparison of the four phenomenological formulae with the experimental data used in the interval of x from 0.8 to 2.0.

The PF2 with parameters separately fitted by tight bound, weakly bound and halo projectiles is a parameterized method to do the comparison. For finding the unified formula for nuclear radius, namely for the strong absorbed radius, the PF3 and PF4 are compared. However, the improvement in PF3 with symmetry dependence considered is not good enough to consistently describe the nuclear size. Finally, the PF4 with the isospin and binding energy considered is recommended by this work for the phenomenological formula of Rs, which reduces the deviation not only between the experimental data and the theoretical curve but also among the three kinds of projectiles. And the inconsistency among the tightly bound systems is also improved by PF4.\n\\section{Calculation of Nuclear Radius}\nAs discussed above, PF4 not only reduces the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical curve but also among the three kinds of projectiles, when we compare the four parameterized theoretical formula (PF1 to PF4) in order to obtain the strong absorption radius $R_{s}$. Which means that if we use the recommended formula PF4 for calculating $R_{s}$ of systems with tightly bound, weakly bound and halo projectiles to calculate $x$ and plot the figure of $\\theta_{1/4}$ vs $x$, we can see that all the systems are on one curve of TQAF. The nuclear size is obviously correlated to the quarter-point angle, because $x$ is a function of $R_{s}$, which indicates that we may extract the radius of nuclei from the experimental quarter-point angle.\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}\n\n\n\\hline\nNuclei & $R_{rms}/fm$  & Ref. \\\\\n\\hline\n${}^{6}He$ & $2.30\\pm{0.07}$ & \\cite{bibitem16}  \\\\\n${}^{8}He$ & $2.69\\pm{0.03}$ & \\cite{bibitem17}  \\\\\n${}^{8}B$ & $2.38\\pm{0.04}$ & \\cite{bibitem18}  \\\\\n${}^{9}C$ & $2.71\\pm{0.32}$ & \\cite{bibitem19}  \\\\\n${}^{10}Be$ & $2.479\\pm{0.028}$ & \\cite{bibitem20}  \\\\\n${}^{10}C$ & $2.42\\pm{0.10}$ & \\cite{bibitem21}  \\\\\n${}^{11}Li$ & $3.34_{-0.08}^{+0.04}$ & \\cite{bibitem22}  \\\\\n${}^{11}Be$ & $2.73\\pm{0.05}$ & \\cite{bibitem23}  \\\\\n${}^{11}C$ & $2.46\\pm{0.03}$ & \\cite{bibitem20}  \\\\\n${}^{12}N$ & $2.47\\pm{0.07}$ & \\cite{bibitem24}  \\\\\n${}^{13}O$ & $2.53\\pm{0.05}$ & \\cite{bibitem24}  \\\\\n${}^{14}Be$ & $3.10\\pm{0.15}$ & \\cite{bibitem25}  \\\\\n${}^{17}B$ & $2.99\\pm{0.09}$ & \\cite{bibitem25}  \\\\\n${}^{17}F$ & $2.71\\pm{0.18}$ & \\cite{bibitem26} \\\\\n${}^{17}Ne$ & $2.75\\pm{0.07}$ & \\cite{bibitem24}  \\\\\n${}^{19}B$ & $3.11\\pm{0.13}$ & \\cite{bibitem25}  \\\\\n${}^{23}Al$ & $2.905\\pm{0.250}$ & \\cite{bibitem26}  \\\\\n${}^{27}P$ & $3.020\\pm{0.155}$ & \\cite{bibitem26}  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{The values of $\\triangle{\\eta}$ and $\\triangle{\\eta_{TB}}$ for PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4. }\n\\end{table}\n\nFor all applications, we calculate radius of nuclei as projectiles using the formulae fitted from experimental quarter-point angle and separately compare them with the experimental charge radius \\cite{bibitem13} for tightly-bound (FIG. 7) and weakly-bound nuclei (FIG. 8) and with experimental root mean square (rms) matter radius (TABLE III) for halo nuclei (FIG. 9). For light nuclei, the nuclear experimental charge radius usually agrees with the mass radius, but for heavy nuclei having more neutrons than protons, the mass radius might larger than the charge radius. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the calculation of tightly-bound and light weakly-bound nuclei based on PF3 and PF4 can be deemed as a better representation for determining nuclear size than PF1 and PF2. The goal of extracting the radius of exotic nuclei from the experimental quarter-point angle can be embodied by the calculation based on PF4 as shown in FIG. 9, which clearly shows the feasibility of acquiring the radius of halo nuclei via the experimental quarter-point angle. From the comparison, the calculation for light halo nuclei based on PF3 does not agree with the experimental values.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{RTightlybound.pdf}\n \\caption{\\label{Fig_7} (Color online) Comparison of the calculated mass radius (R1, R2, R3 and R4) basing on the four phenomenological formulae with nuclear charge radius for tightly-bound nuclei ${}^{4}He$, ${}^{12}C$, ${}^{16}O$, ${}^{20}Ne$ and ${}^{24}Ma$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{Rweaklybound.pdf}\n \\caption{\\label{Fig_8} (Color online) Comparison of the calculated mass radius based on the four phenomenological formulae PF1 to PF4 (R1, R2, R3 and R4) with nuclear rms charge radius for weakly-bound nuclei.}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{RHalo.pdf}\n \\caption{\\label{Fig_9} (Color online) Comparison of the calculated mass radius based on the phenomenological formulae PF3 and PF4 (R3 and R4) with nuclear rms matter radius for halo nuclei.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs a matter of fact, the elastic scattering of a halo nucleus from a stable target can give simple direct evidence for the structure of the halo nucleus \\cite{bibitem14}. The angular distribution of elastic scattering reactions show a maximum difference for incident energies around the top of the Coulomb barrier, thereby suggesting that it is in this energy region where the elastic scattering is most sensitive to the details of the nuclear structure of the exotic projectiles \\cite{bibitem15}. The quarter-point angle as a function of strong absorption radius $R_{s}$ obtained via angular distributions of elastic scattering cross section, is related to the actual reaction mechanisms. This $R_{s}$ is not only related to the size of the nuclei but also to the elastic scattering reactions with coupling to the channels of inelastic scattering or other reactions. The nuclear properties, such as, nuclear radius, isospin and binding energy per nucleon, will affect the strength of the couplings for different incident energies. Inversely, we can extract the information of the structure from elastic scattering reaction, such as the nuclear size. Experimentally, the nuclear radius can be determined by electron scattering, isotope shift and interaction cross section etc. Since electron is structure less and the electromagnetic interaction is known very well, therefore the charge distribution of the nuclei can be precisely measured by electron scattering. However, it is suitable for the stable nuclei only, as the unstable nuclei are short-lived and difficult to use as targets. For the unstable nuclei especially for the halo nuclei, people usually use the isotope method or interaction cross section to measure the size of nuclei. However, extracting the radius of unstable nuclei from the experimental quarter-point angle could be a useful tool as the new experimental measurement. Therefore, the PF4 with more details of structure (spatial extension, isospin and binding energy) is recommended by this work for nuclear radius.\n\\section{Conclusions}\nThe motivation of present work is to correlate quarter-point angle and nuclear radius. The theoretical strong absorption radius Rs were obtained and compared. In this work, four phenomenological formulae (PF1 to PF4) were presumed and the parameters for different formulae were fitted by using the extracted experimental values of Rs. Considering the different kinds of reaction systems, the four phenomenological formulae are analyzed and discussed. Based on the above mentioned formulae, the radii of different kind of nuclei as projectiles were obtained and explained in detail. As a result, the parameterized formula related to the isospin and binding energy was recommended. In conclusion, the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical curve and among the three kinds of projectiles can be minimized by appropriately calculating the nuclear radius in order to determine the strong absorption radius. This may lead to a better understanding of the nuclear structure and the actual reaction mechanisms using the three types of projectiles (strongly bound, weakly bound and halo nuclei).\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\nThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China with Grant No. U1432247 and 11575256 and the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) with Grant No. 2014CB845405 and 2013CB83440x.
