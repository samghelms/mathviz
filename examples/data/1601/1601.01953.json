The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation approximation \\cite{Perdew1996} gave a good description of the lattice parameters and magnetic moments. The paramagnetic phase was modeled within the coherent\npotential approximation \\cite{Soven1967} combined with the disordered local moment \\cite{Pindor1983, Staunton1984} approach. This approximation accurately describes the paramagnetic state with randomly oriented local magnetic moments\n\\cite{Pindor1983}. Here, the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ ternary system was treated as a quaternary Al(Fe$^{\\uparrow}_{0.5}$Fe$^{\\downarrow}_{0.5}$)$_2$B$_2$ alloy, with a random mixture of two magnetic states of Fe. The orientation of the magnetic moments have been evaluated as a difference of the total energies calculated for the three magnetisation directions, along $a$, $b$ and $c$ axes, respectively, without considering the full-potential effects. The basis set consisted of $s$, $p$, $d$ and $f$ orbitals ($l_{\\rm max}$=3) and the\nnumber of {\\bf k} points was set to 340, 2000 and 11000 for the calculation of the ground state properties, density of states (and magnetic exchange integrals) and orientations of the magnetic moments, respectively.\n\n\n\\section{Results and discussion}\n\\label{}\n\n\\subsection{Phase analysis}\nThe recorded and calculated intensities of the XRD patterns at room temperature for the sample prepared from natural boron are shown in figure \\ref{fig-x-ray} confirming that AlFe$_2$B$_2$ crystallises in the orthorhombic space group \\textit{Cmmm} with the unit cell parameters $a$ = 2.9256(4) \\AA, $b$ = 11.0247(4) \\AA{} and $c$ = 2.8709(2) \\AA{}.

As can be seen, the $a$ and $b$ parameters decrease continuously while $c$ increases with decreasing temperature. The different changes of the unit cell parameters give a rather constant unit cell volume (right panel of figure \\ref{fig-lowtemp-unitcell}) down to 250 K where the cell volume starts to decrease with decreasing temperature. However, the discontinuities previously reported to occur in the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters near the transition temperature \\cite{Lewis2015} are not reproduced in these experiments.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 1.00\\textwidth]{AlFe2B2-lowtemp-unitcell.pdf}\n\\caption{The development of the unit cell parameters (left) and unit cell volume (right) as a function of temperature for AlFe$_2$B$_2$.

This sample was not as phase pure as the sample made with natural boron, e.g. the occupancies of Fe is slightly lower in the $^{11}$B-sample compared to the one with natural boron and there is existence of non-magnetic secondary phases. However, for consistency with the results from the neutron diffraction studies, the results from the $^{11}$B-sample are mainly reported, but results from the natural boron sample are included where comparison is instructive.\n  \n\n\n\\subsection{Magnetisation and magnetocaloric effect}\nFigure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW} shows the magnetisation vs. temperature data recorded in the FCC and FCW modes under two different magnetic fields, 4 kA/m (figure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW}a) and 800 kA/m (figure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW}b). The ferromagnetic transition temperature can be estimated from the derivative of the M vs. T curves. From the insets of figure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW}, T$\\rm _c$ can be extracted to be 285 K. There is no appreciable thermal hysteresis between the cooling and warming curves near the transition temperature. This is an indication that, unlike a recent report of a first order transition in AlFe$_2$B$_2$ \\cite{Lewis2015}, the sample shows a second order magnetic transition. It should here be mentioned that the measurement protocols employed in this study have been done using the settle mode (the temperature is stabilised at each point before measuring the magnetisation) so as to eliminate any spurious effects due to temperature lag which often occur when measurements are made in sweep mode. In figure \\ref{fig-MvsHat10K} the M vs. H curve recorded at 10 K is shown. The saturation magnetisation of the sample, estimated from magnetisation value at 4000 kA/m, turns out to be 0.9 $\\mu_B$/Fe, which is lower than the moment derived from our theoretical (1.1 $\\mu_B$/Fe) as well as  neutron diffraction studies (1.4 $\\mu_B$/Fe). The presence of non-magnetic impurity phases in the studied sample could well account for this difference. The AlFe$_2$B$_2$ sample made from the natural isotopical composition of boron was also measured, yielding a somewhat higher T$\\rm _c$ (295 K) and higher saturation magnetisation (1.0 $\\mu_B$/Fe).\n\nThe M vs. H curves at several temperatures around the transition temperature (T ranging from 260 K to 305 K, with temperature intervals of 2.5 K) are shown in figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}. This measurement serves a dual purpose. Firstly, the possibility to check the order of the transition. The nature of the magnetic transition can be obtained from the slope of isotherm plots of M$^2$ vs. H/M of this Arrot plot. This criterion for deciding the nature of the transition is generally referred to as the Banerjee criterion \\cite{Banerjee1964}, and has been widely used to experimentally determine the order of the magnetic phase transition. Briefly, a positive or a negative slope of the experimental M$^2$ vs. H/M curve indicates a second order or a first order transition, respectively. The Banerjee criterion provides a straightforward way to distinguish between samples showing a first order transition and those showing a second order transition, because the slope of the M$^2$ vs. H/M curves changes sign. This criterion have been applied in this investigation (figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}b). As is clear from the figure, the slope of the M$^2$ vs. H/M curves are positive throughout the measured temperature range, confirming that the sample shows a second order transition. \n\nThe curves shown in figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}a have also been used to estimate the magnetic entropy change ($\\Delta \\rm S_{mag}$) in the sample. The plot of $\\Delta \\rm S_{mag}$ vs. temperature is shown in figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}c. The maximum entropy change occurs at around T$\\rm _c$ = 285 K, and is -1.3 J/kg K for a change of magnetic field from 0 to 800 kA/m, and -4.5 J/kg K for a change of magnetic field from 0 to 4000 kA/m.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 0.6666\\textwidth]{MvsT.pdf}\n\\caption{FCC and FCW magnetisation as a function of temperature using a field of (a) 4 kA/m and (b) 800kA/m.

As seen in the powder diffractograms, there are additional phases present in the $^{11}$B-sample. Most of the peaks that does not belong to the main phase ($\\sim$5 \\%) can be explained by small amounts of tetragonal boron ($a$ = 8.917(2) \\AA, $c$ = 5.025(7) \\AA, with the space group \\textit{P$\\bar{4}$n2} \\cite{Hoard1951}). A second additional phase could be identified using a orthorhombic unit cell ($a$ =17.081(7) \\AA, $b$ = 11.354(8) \\AA, $c$ = 2.288(1) \\AA, space group = \\textit{Pnma}). This second additional phase could not be identified even though all reported binary and ternary phases in the Al-Fe-B system were tested, as well as their oxides, hydroxides and chlorides. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 1.00\\textwidth]{NPD-AlFe2B2.pdf}\n\\caption{Neutron powder diffraction patterns of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ refined with the Rietveld method at 320 K (upper) and 20 K (lower).

Difference in the intensities of these reflections can be explained by magnetic contribution with the same magnetic unit cell as the nuclear phase (propagation vector k = (000)). In order to determine the magnetic structure of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ several symmetry allowed magnetic structure models were tried in which the moments were aligned along the different crystallographic axis, as well as more complex models with e.g. moments aligned in the $ab$-plane. The contribution of the different magnetic models to the calculated total intensities in comparison with measured ones are shown in figure \\ref{NPD-difference}b.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 1.00\\textwidth]{AlFe2B2-NPD-comparison.pdf}\n\\caption{Difference curve for the temperatures 320 K and 20 K, the 20 K dataset has been shifted by -0.2\\textdegree{} to compensate for thermal expansion effects (a) and a comparison of the refinements for the different magnetic models (b). $\\lambda$ = 2.52 \\AA.}\n\\label{NPD-difference}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nBy comparing the different magnetic models, the best agreement with the observed intensities is achieved by aligning the magnetic moments ferromagnetically along the $a$-axis of the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ unit cell, with the Shubnikov Group \\textit{Cmm'm'}, refinement parameters are given in table \\ref{tab:mag}. This gives a magnetic moment of 1.4(3) $\\mu_B$/Fe-atom. All other models give magnetic intensities larger than 0 for the (110) peak in combination with under- or overestimating the (001) and (040) peaks in the diffractogram (figure \\ref{NPD-difference}b), something which is not in agreement with the observed difference in intensities between temperatures. This model is also in agreement with the results from the performed ab initio calculations. The proposed model can be seen in figure \\ref{Mag-structure}a.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n\\small\n\\caption{Placement, occupancies and magnetic moments of the magnetic Fe-atoms for 320 and 20 K from neutron diffraction refinements.}\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\textwidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}llllllllll}\n\\toprule\nAtom\t& Site\t& \\multicolumn{4}{l}{320 K} & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{20 K} \\\\\n\\cline{3-10}\n & & x & y & z & Occ. & x & y & z & Magnetic moment ($\\mu_B$) \\\\\n\\midrule\nFe\t\t& 4j\t\t& 0\t\t\t& 0.3549(1)\t& 0.5\t& 0.250(1) & 0 & 0.3560(1)\t& 0.5\t& 1.4(3)\t\\\\\nB\t\t\t& 4i\t\t& 0\t\t\t& 0.2075(1)\t& 0\t\t& 0.250(1) & 0 & 0.2065(1)\t& 0\t\t& -\t\\\\\nAl\t\t& 2a\t\t& 0\t\t\t& 0\t\t\t\t\t& 0\t\t& 0.125(1) & 0 & 0\t\t\t\t\t& 0\t\t& - \\\\\n\\midrule\n & & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{R$_{Bragg}$ = 7.23, R$_{wp}$ = 12.1} & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{R$_{Bragg}$ = 6.30, R$_{mag}$ = 5.16, R$_{wp}$ = 13.8} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\label{tab:mag}\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table*}\n\nThis model is similar to that of the low temperature magnetic structure of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ \\cite{Cedervall-Fe5SiB2}, which has a layered structure with magnetic moments aligned along the Fe-B-layer in the structure.

In the FM phase, AlFe$_2$B$_2$ shows a spin-polarization that results in a magnetic moment of 1.077 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$/Fe-atom. Very small magnetic moments are induced on Al and B, -0.05 and -0.02 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$, respectively, and they couple anti-ferromagnetically to the Fe atoms. The total magnetisation for the modelled PM configuration is zero. As is presented in the middle panel of figure \\ref{dosfig} the spin-up and spin-down channel cancel each other. However, there is an observable shift between the spin-up and spin-down channel of the Fe 3$d$ DOS (see lower panel of figure \\ref{dosfig}), resulting in 0.3841 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ local moment of Fe. The existence of local Fe moments in the modelled paramagnetic phase indicates that a metamagnetic phase transition is not likely in case of AlFe$_2$B$_2$.   \n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=75mm]{dos.pdf}\n\\caption{Spin and site projected densities of states of FM (upper panel) and PM (middle panel) AlFe$_2$B$_2$.

Cooling devices utilising the GMCE are to become 20-30\\% more energy efficient than conventional vapour compression systems \\cite{GschneidnerJr2008} and could thus contribute to the development of a sustainable global energy economy. The materials showing the highest GMCE contain rare earth elements, which are high in cost and have a negative impact on the environment during mining. Therefore, to increase the sustainability and allow up-scaling, rare earth free materials (both the included magnetocaloric and  permanent magnet material) should be utilised in an application  \\cite{Coey2012}. As a consequence there is a need of finding suitable ferromagnetic compounds consisting of cheap and abundant elements. Examples of rare earth free materials for future magnetic cooling devices are FeMnP$_{\\rm 1-x}$Si$_{\\rm x}$ \\cite{Hoglin2015} and the substoichiometric compound Mn$_{1.25}$Fe$_{0.70}$P$_{\\rm 1-x}$Si$_{\\rm x}$ \\cite{Miao2014}, both of which have the hexagonal Fe$_2$P-type structure \\cite{Carlsson1973}. These materials have tunable near room temperature Curie temperatures (T$\\rm _c$) and high magnetic entropy changes ($\\Delta \\rm S_{mag}$). \n\nAnother class of potential magnetocaloric materials is AlM$_2$B$_2$ (M = Fe, Mn, Cr) based on AlFe$_2$B$_2$ \\cite{Jeitschko1969,ElMassalami2011,Tan2013,Chai2014}. AlFe$_2$B$_2$ crystallises in an orthorhombic structure (space group \\textit{Cmmm}) with two formula units per unit cell and cell parameters 2.9233(10), 11.0337(14) and 2.8703(3) $\\AA$ for $a$, $b$ and $c$ respectively \\cite{Jeitschko1969}. It is a layered structure along the $b$-axis where (Fe$_2$B$_2$)-slabs are alternated with layers of aluminium atoms. In the aluminium layer the atoms occupy the \\textit{2a}-position and in the (Fe$_2$B$_2$)-slabs iron and boron occupy the \\textit{4j} and \\textit{4i} positions, respectively. In previous studies, magnetic measurements and M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy have shown that AlFe$_2$B$_2$ is a ferromagnetic material with reported values of T$\\rm _c$ varying between 282-320 K and saturation magnetic moments ranging between 0.95 and 1.25 $\\mu_B$/Fe-atom \\cite{ElMassalami2011,Tan2013,Chai2014}. The magnetic entropy change has been reported to -4.1 and -7.7 J/K kg at an applied magnetic field of 1600 and 4000 kA/m, respectively \\cite{Tan2013}.\n\nIn this study we report on crystallographic and magnetic properties of AlFe$_2$B$_2$, including the magnetic structure, investigated using XRD, neutron diffraction, magnetic measurements as well as electronic structure calculations. Our study reveals the low temperature magnetic structure of AlFe$_2$B$_2$, reports the behaviour of the lattice parameters through the temperature region of the ferromagnetic transition and suggests that this transition is of second order. \n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{}\n\n\\subsection{Sample preparation}\nThe samples were synthesised by arc melting stoichiometric amounts of iron (Leico Industries, purity 99.995\\%. Surface oxides were reduced in H$_2$-gas.), boron (Wacher-Chemie, purity 99.995\\% or Los Alamos National Laboratories, pure $^{11}$B) and aluminium (Gr\\\"anges SM, purity 99.999\\%) under an argon atmosphere. To suppress formation of unwanted phases; FeB was first prepared and then AlFe$_2$B$_2$ was produced with a 50\\% excess amount of  aluminium \\cite{ElMassalami2011}. To ensure maximum homogeneity the samples were remelted 5 times in total. The samples were crushed and pressed into pellets, placed in evacuated silica tubes, annealed for 14 days at 1173 K and subsequently quenched in cold water. Some additional phases were removed by etching the samples in diluted HCl (1:1) for 10 minutes. Two samples were prepared, one using natural boron and the other using isotopically pure $^{11}$B to allow neutron diffraction experiments.\n\n\\subsection{X-ray powder diffraction}\nTo analyse the crystalline phases and to perform crystal structure determinations X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) were performed with a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with a Lynx-eye position sensitive detector (PSD, 4\\textdegree\\ opening) using CuK$\\alpha_1$ radiation ($\\lambda$ = 1.540598 \\AA ), in a 2$\\theta$ range of 20-90\\textdegree\\ at room temperature. Temperature dependant (16-295 K) diffraction patterns were also recorded to study changes in the unit cell parameters through the magnetic transition with added Si as an internal standard.\n\n\\subsection{Neutron powder diffraction}\nThe nuclear and magnetic structures were determined by refinement of neutron powder diffraction patterns collected at the D1B beamline at ILL (Grenoble, France). A pyrolytic graphite monochromator (reflection 002) was used, giving a neutron wavelength of 2.52 \\AA. Diffraction patterns were recorded within a 2$\\theta$ range of 5-128\\textdegree, at the discrete temperatures 16, 150, 200, 300 and 500 K as well as upon ramping between these temperatures \\cite{ExpdataILL}. The sample was kept in a double-walled V container to minimise absorption by the sample.\n\n\\subsection{Refinement of the crystal and magnetic structures}\nThe X-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns were analysed with the FullProf software \\cite{Rodriguez-Carvajal1993} utilising the Rietveld method \\cite{Rietveld1969}. The pseudo-Voigt profile function was used to describe the profile function and the background was described by linear interpolation between chosen points. In the refinement the following 16 parameters were varied: zero point, background, scale factor, peak shape, half width parameters (3), unit cell parameters (3), atom occupancies (3), isotropic temperature parameter and atomic coordinates (2). To precisely determine the unit cell parameters refinements were performed in the software UnitCell \\cite{Holland1997}. \n\nSymmetry analysis of possible magnetic arrangement were done using the software package Sarah \\cite{Wills2000}. Different irreducible representation were tested against measured neutron diffraction patterns. \n\n\\subsection{Magnetisation}\nMagnetic measurements were made using an MPMS SQUID magnetometer from Quantum design as well as a PPMS VSM system also from Quantum Design. Magnetisation (M) as a function of temperature (T) measurements were carried out in the temperature interval 20 to 400 K using both Field Cool Cooling (FCC) and Field Cool Warming (FCW) protocols. The M vs. T measurements were made using two different fields 4 and 800 kA/m. Magnetisation as a function of magnetic field (H) measurements were made at different temperatures, 10 K and 260 to 305 K in 2.5 K steps. The series of measurements from 260 to 305 K were made to estimate the magnetic entropy $\\Delta \\rm S_{mag}$ using the equation \n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta S_{mag}=\\mu_0 \\int^{H_f}_{H_i}{\\left(\\frac{dM}{dT}\\right)_H}dH \n\\label{eq:deltaS}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta S_{mag}=\\mu_{0}\\int^{H_{f}}_{H_{i}}{\\left(\\frac{dM}{dT}\\right)_{H}}dH\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></msubsup><mrow><msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>H</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01953.tex", "nexttext": " where $\\rho^{\\uparrow}$(0) and $\\rho^{\\downarrow}$(0) are the spin-up and spin-down densities at the Fe nucleus.

The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation approximation \\cite{Perdew1996} gave a good description of the lattice parameters and magnetic moments. The paramagnetic phase was modeled within the coherent\npotential approximation \\cite{Soven1967} combined with the disordered local moment \\cite{Pindor1983, Staunton1984} approach. This approximation accurately describes the paramagnetic state with randomly oriented local magnetic moments\n\\cite{Pindor1983}. Here, the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ ternary system was treated as a quaternary Al(Fe$^{\\uparrow}_{0.5}$Fe$^{\\downarrow}_{0.5}$)$_2$B$_2$ alloy, with a random mixture of two magnetic states of Fe. The orientation of the magnetic moments have been evaluated as a difference of the total energies calculated for the three magnetisation directions, along $a$, $b$ and $c$ axes, respectively, without considering the full-potential effects. The basis set consisted of $s$, $p$, $d$ and $f$ orbitals ($l_{\\rm max}$=3) and the\nnumber of {\\bf k} points was set to 340, 2000 and 11000 for the calculation of the ground state properties, density of states (and magnetic exchange integrals) and orientations of the magnetic moments, respectively.\n\n\n\\section{Results and discussion}\n\\label{}\n\n\\subsection{Phase analysis}\nThe recorded and calculated intensities of the XRD patterns at room temperature for the sample prepared from natural boron are shown in figure \\ref{fig-x-ray} confirming that AlFe$_2$B$_2$ crystallises in the orthorhombic space group \\textit{Cmmm} with the unit cell parameters $a$ = 2.9256(4) \\AA, $b$ = 11.0247(4) \\AA{} and $c$ = 2.8709(2) \\AA{}. The atomic coordinates and occupancies obtained from the refined structure model are listed in table \\ref{tab:atom-pos} and are in agreement with results from previous studies \\cite{Jeitschko1969}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 1.00\\textwidth]{AlFe2B2-diffraction.pdf}\n\\caption{X-ray powder diffraction pattern of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ refined with the Rietveld method.

As can be seen, the $a$ and $b$ parameters decrease continuously while $c$ increases with decreasing temperature. The different changes of the unit cell parameters give a rather constant unit cell volume (right panel of figure \\ref{fig-lowtemp-unitcell}) down to 250 K where the cell volume starts to decrease with decreasing temperature. However, the discontinuities previously reported to occur in the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters near the transition temperature \\cite{Lewis2015} are not reproduced in these experiments.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 1.00\\textwidth]{AlFe2B2-lowtemp-unitcell.pdf}\n\\caption{The development of the unit cell parameters (left) and unit cell volume (right) as a function of temperature for AlFe$_2$B$_2$. The vertical dashed line marks T$\\rm _c$.}\n\\label{fig-lowtemp-unitcell}\n\\end{figure}\n\nMost of the experiments in this investigation were performed on the sample that was synthesised with pure $^{11}$B to allow neutron diffraction measurements. This sample was not as phase pure as the sample made with natural boron, e.g. the occupancies of Fe is slightly lower in the $^{11}$B-sample compared to the one with natural boron and there is existence of non-magnetic secondary phases. However, for consistency with the results from the neutron diffraction studies, the results from the $^{11}$B-sample are mainly reported, but results from the natural boron sample are included where comparison is instructive.\n  \n\n\n\\subsection{Magnetisation and magnetocaloric effect}\nFigure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW} shows the magnetisation vs. temperature data recorded in the FCC and FCW modes under two different magnetic fields, 4 kA/m (figure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW}a) and 800 kA/m (figure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW}b). The ferromagnetic transition temperature can be estimated from the derivative of the M vs. T curves. From the insets of figure \\ref{fig-FCC_FCW}, T$\\rm _c$ can be extracted to be 285 K. There is no appreciable thermal hysteresis between the cooling and warming curves near the transition temperature. This is an indication that, unlike a recent report of a first order transition in AlFe$_2$B$_2$ \\cite{Lewis2015}, the sample shows a second order magnetic transition. It should here be mentioned that the measurement protocols employed in this study have been done using the settle mode (the temperature is stabilised at each point before measuring the magnetisation) so as to eliminate any spurious effects due to temperature lag which often occur when measurements are made in sweep mode. In figure \\ref{fig-MvsHat10K} the M vs. H curve recorded at 10 K is shown. The saturation magnetisation of the sample, estimated from magnetisation value at 4000 kA/m, turns out to be 0.9 $\\mu_B$/Fe, which is lower than the moment derived from our theoretical (1.1 $\\mu_B$/Fe) as well as  neutron diffraction studies (1.4 $\\mu_B$/Fe). The presence of non-magnetic impurity phases in the studied sample could well account for this difference. The AlFe$_2$B$_2$ sample made from the natural isotopical composition of boron was also measured, yielding a somewhat higher T$\\rm _c$ (295 K) and higher saturation magnetisation (1.0 $\\mu_B$/Fe).\n\nThe M vs. H curves at several temperatures around the transition temperature (T ranging from 260 K to 305 K, with temperature intervals of 2.5 K) are shown in figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}. This measurement serves a dual purpose. Firstly, the possibility to check the order of the transition. The nature of the magnetic transition can be obtained from the slope of isotherm plots of M$^2$ vs. H/M of this Arrot plot. This criterion for deciding the nature of the transition is generally referred to as the Banerjee criterion \\cite{Banerjee1964}, and has been widely used to experimentally determine the order of the magnetic phase transition. Briefly, a positive or a negative slope of the experimental M$^2$ vs. H/M curve indicates a second order or a first order transition, respectively. The Banerjee criterion provides a straightforward way to distinguish between samples showing a first order transition and those showing a second order transition, because the slope of the M$^2$ vs. H/M curves changes sign. This criterion have been applied in this investigation (figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}b). As is clear from the figure, the slope of the M$^2$ vs. H/M curves are positive throughout the measured temperature range, confirming that the sample shows a second order transition. \n\nThe curves shown in figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}a have also been used to estimate the magnetic entropy change ($\\Delta \\rm S_{mag}$) in the sample. The plot of $\\Delta \\rm S_{mag}$ vs. temperature is shown in figure \\ref{fig-MvsH_deltaS_Arrot}c. The maximum entropy change occurs at around T$\\rm _c$ = 285 K, and is -1.3 J/kg K for a change of magnetic field from 0 to 800 kA/m, and -4.5 J/kg K for a change of magnetic field from 0 to 4000 kA/m.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 0.6666\\textwidth]{MvsT.pdf}\n\\caption{FCC and FCW magnetisation as a function of temperature using a field of (a) 4 kA/m and (b) 800kA/m.

As seen in the powder diffractograms, there are additional phases present in the $^{11}$B-sample. Most of the peaks that does not belong to the main phase ($\\sim$5 \\%) can be explained by small amounts of tetragonal boron ($a$ = 8.917(2) \\AA, $c$ = 5.025(7) \\AA, with the space group \\textit{P$\\bar{4}$n2} \\cite{Hoard1951}). A second additional phase could be identified using a orthorhombic unit cell ($a$ =17.081(7) \\AA, $b$ = 11.354(8) \\AA, $c$ = 2.288(1) \\AA, space group = \\textit{Pnma}). This second additional phase could not be identified even though all reported binary and ternary phases in the Al-Fe-B system were tested, as well as their oxides, hydroxides and chlorides. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 1.00\\textwidth]{NPD-AlFe2B2.pdf}\n\\caption{Neutron powder diffraction patterns of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ refined with the Rietveld method at 320 K (upper) and 20 K (lower).

Difference in the intensities of these reflections can be explained by magnetic contribution with the same magnetic unit cell as the nuclear phase (propagation vector k = (000)). In order to determine the magnetic structure of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ several symmetry allowed magnetic structure models were tried in which the moments were aligned along the different crystallographic axis, as well as more complex models with e.g. moments aligned in the $ab$-plane. The contribution of the different magnetic models to the calculated total intensities in comparison with measured ones are shown in figure \\ref{NPD-difference}b.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 1.00\\textwidth]{AlFe2B2-NPD-comparison.pdf}\n\\caption{Difference curve for the temperatures 320 K and 20 K, the 20 K dataset has been shifted by -0.2\\textdegree{} to compensate for thermal expansion effects (a) and a comparison of the refinements for the different magnetic models (b). $\\lambda$ = 2.52 \\AA.}\n\\label{NPD-difference}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nBy comparing the different magnetic models, the best agreement with the observed intensities is achieved by aligning the magnetic moments ferromagnetically along the $a$-axis of the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ unit cell, with the Shubnikov Group \\textit{Cmm'm'}, refinement parameters are given in table \\ref{tab:mag}. This gives a magnetic moment of 1.4(3) $\\mu_B$/Fe-atom. All other models give magnetic intensities larger than 0 for the (110) peak in combination with under- or overestimating the (001) and (040) peaks in the diffractogram (figure \\ref{NPD-difference}b), something which is not in agreement with the observed difference in intensities between temperatures. This model is also in agreement with the results from the performed ab initio calculations. The proposed model can be seen in figure \\ref{Mag-structure}a.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n\\small\n\\caption{Placement, occupancies and magnetic moments of the magnetic Fe-atoms for 320 and 20 K from neutron diffraction refinements.}\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\textwidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}llllllllll}\n\\toprule\nAtom\t& Site\t& \\multicolumn{4}{l}{320 K} & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{20 K} \\\\\n\\cline{3-10}\n & & x & y & z & Occ. & x & y & z & Magnetic moment ($\\mu_B$) \\\\\n\\midrule\nFe\t\t& 4j\t\t& 0\t\t\t& 0.3549(1)\t& 0.5\t& 0.250(1) & 0 & 0.3560(1)\t& 0.5\t& 1.4(3)\t\\\\\nB\t\t\t& 4i\t\t& 0\t\t\t& 0.2075(1)\t& 0\t\t& 0.250(1) & 0 & 0.2065(1)\t& 0\t\t& -\t\\\\\nAl\t\t& 2a\t\t& 0\t\t\t& 0\t\t\t\t\t& 0\t\t& 0.125(1) & 0 & 0\t\t\t\t\t& 0\t\t& - \\\\\n\\midrule\n & & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{R$_{Bragg}$ = 7.23, R$_{wp}$ = 12.1} & \\multicolumn{4}{l}{R$_{Bragg}$ = 6.30, R$_{mag}$ = 5.16, R$_{wp}$ = 13.8} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\label{tab:mag}\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table*}\n\nThis model is similar to that of the low temperature magnetic structure of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ \\cite{Cedervall-Fe5SiB2}, which has a layered structure with magnetic moments aligned along the Fe-B-layer in the structure.

In the FM phase, AlFe$_2$B$_2$ shows a spin-polarization that results in a magnetic moment of 1.077 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$/Fe-atom. Very small magnetic moments are induced on Al and B, -0.05 and -0.02 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$, respectively, and they couple anti-ferromagnetically to the Fe atoms. The total magnetisation for the modelled PM configuration is zero. As is presented in the middle panel of figure \\ref{dosfig} the spin-up and spin-down channel cancel each other. However, there is an observable shift between the spin-up and spin-down channel of the Fe 3$d$ DOS (see lower panel of figure \\ref{dosfig}), resulting in 0.3841 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ local moment of Fe. The existence of local Fe moments in the modelled paramagnetic phase indicates that a metamagnetic phase transition is not likely in case of AlFe$_2$B$_2$.   \n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=75mm]{dos.pdf}\n\\caption{Spin and site projected densities of states of FM (upper panel) and PM (middle panel) AlFe$_2$B$_2$.

The Curie temperature was estimated to be 250 K using Monte Carlo method implemented in UppASD \\cite{uppasd} code.\n\nThe Fe hyperfine field B$_{\\rm hf}$ was calculated by evaluating the Fermi contact contribution \n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}B_{hf} = \\frac{2}{3} \\mu_0 \\mu_B [\\rho^{\\uparrow}(0) - \\rho^{\\downarrow}(0)]\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"B_{hf}=\\frac{2}{3}\\mu_{0}\\mu_{B}[\\rho^{\\uparrow}(0)-\\rho^{\\downarrow}(0)]\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>B</mi><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2191</mo></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msup><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2193</mo></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
