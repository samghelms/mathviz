Angular momentum loss and spin-down then lead to the fading of\n chromospheric activity with age, but on a mass-dependent timescale - whilst solar-type stars will \ncease to display H$\\alpha$ emission on timescale of $\\sim 100$ Myr, there can be H$\\alpha$ emission\n in lower mass M-dwarfs even at ages of 1 Gyr and beyond \\citep{boch07}. Thus narrow H$\\alpha$ emission\n lines can be used as a mass-dependent indicator of a youthful status and thus as a condition \nto assign cluster membership in combination with other criteria.\n\nAs in \\citet{fras15},  to define active stars we considered \nthe net H$\\alpha$  equivalent width (EWHaChr) values from the GES recommended parameters, available\nfor 205 of the entire sample of observed stars. In addition,\nwe used the $\\alpha_c$ index\nderived by \\citet{dami14} that measures the  H$\\alpha$ core (2 $\\AA$ from the line center) both in cases of emission and absorption.\nIt has been measured for  1153 stars \nof our sample.\n \nFigure\\,\\ref{halphamem} shows \nthe chromospheric EW(H$\\alpha$) as a function of  the $\\alpha_c$ index (upper panel) and \nthe  $\\alpha_c$ index as a function of the V-I color (lower panel).\nIt is evident that, for  Log (EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr}))>$-0.5, the chromospheric EW(H$\\alpha$)\nis well correlated to the  $\\alpha_c$ index (upper panel). \n\n\nIn addition, most of the\ncluster members show a characteristic trend for high $\\alpha_c$ values as a function of V-I (lower panel), \nthat describes the chromospheric emission dependence on spectral type \\citep{dami14}. Objects with \nH$\\alpha$ absorption line have low $\\alpha_c$ values according to the $\\alpha_c$ index definition. \n\nSince the $\\alpha_c$ values are given for almost the entire sample of GES observed targets,\nwe  used this index to select stars with chromospheric activity. In particular,\nby following the trend of the $\\alpha_c$ index\nof the RV candidate cluster members, we define as active stars  the 242 objects with V-I$>$0.8 and\nLog\\,$\\alpha_c > 0.13(V-I)-0.25$ (dashed line) selected from spectra with S/N$>15$. \n\nThe  selected stars correspond to objects with  Log EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr})>$-0.5 that \ncan  also be considered as a threshold to select confirmed active stars. We discard objects with \nLog EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr})<$-0.5 since they \nshow very small chromospheric activity and  the EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr})$ is affected by large errors.\n\nWe added to the sample of selected active members  the 4 objects with \nLog (EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr}))>$-0.5 that were not selected in the previous step since their $\\alpha_c$ index\nis slightly smaller than the threshold we adopted.\nIn total we selected 246 candidate cluster members on the basis of their chromospheric activity,\n10 of which were already  selected as accretors.\n\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{compare_halpha_dr2dr3.ps}\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{halpha_mem.ps}\n\\caption{Upper panel shows the EW(H$\\alpha)_{Chr}$ as a function of  the $\\alpha_c$ index while\nlower panel shows the  Log $\\alpha_c$  index   as a function of the V-I color (dots).\nEmpty squares are the objects from the {\\it cluster members fiducial sample} and\n  triangles indicate the objects selected as accretors. \nFilled circles are the active candidate members selected on the basis of the $\\alpha_c$ index, \nwhile asterix symbols are those selected on the basis of the EW(H$\\alpha)_{Chr}$. \nThe dashed line\nindicates the lower limit used for the selection with the $\\alpha_c$ index.}\n\\label{halphamem}\n \\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Candidate members from gravity}\nThe $\\gamma$ index, defined using strongly gravity-sensitive lines  \\citep{dami14},\n is an efficient  gravity indicator and \n allows a clear separation between the low gravity giants and the higher gravity\nMS and PMS stars, starting from early G-type stars. Even if with a lower confidence level,\nthis index allows also to distinguish MS from PMS stars. \nFig.\\,\\ref{gravmem} shows the $\\gamma$ index as a function of the V-I color for the 1043 objects\nfor which the index has been released with the GESiDR2iDR3.\nObjects with $\\gamma \\gtrsim 1$ are  giant stars, while those in the bottom region of the plot\nare MS and PMS stars.\nBy using the  {\\it cluster member fiducial sample} \nwe see that most of them, expected to be PMS stars,\nhave $\\gamma$ index values in the upper\nenvelope of the region of high gravity objects ($\\gamma \\lesssim 1$), while MS stars lie in the lower\npart of the same envelope. \n\nWe note that this sample does not include the fast rotator stars ($vsini>30$\\,km/s)\n\n\n\nfor which the $\\gamma$ index value can be altered by the large line widths \\citep{dami14}.\n\nBased on the $\\gamma$ index,  \nwe consider high-probability cluster non members the candidate giants, i.e.  \nall the 592 objects with $\\gamma> 1.0$ and V-I$>$1.2,\n as indicated by the dashed lines in the Figure. \n\nThese objects correspond to\nstars with log\\,g$\\lesssim 3.2$ and T$_{\\rm eff} \\lesssim 5600$\\,K. \nBy using the \\citet{sies00} models,\nwe find that PMS stars with T$<5200$\\,K, older than 1\\,Myr  have log\\,g always greater than $\\sim$3.2,\n\nand therefore we are confident that the objects we are discarding are not PMS stars.\nWe consider all the remaining 648 objects as potential candidate cluster members.\n\nWe are aware that by adopting the {\\it arbitrary} limit $\\gamma=1.0$, we are including a small fraction of\ncandidate giants with $\\gamma\\lesssim1.0$ in our sample of candidate cluster members.\nThis choise is in agreement with  our strategy of being inclusive of all possible candidate cluster members.\n\nThis last sample includes the 451 stars that are MS or PMS stars and the 199 objects for which the\ngravity index is undefined and for which  membership can be assigned by using the other methods.\nWe note that with a low confidence level,  MS could be distinguished by PMS stars \nbut we adopt the inclusive approach to include in our sample of candidate cluster members even\nobjects that are MS stars. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{gravity_mem.ps}\n\\caption{Gravity index $\\gamma$ as a function of the V-I color (dots).

In particular, in the 0.5-8.0 keV\nrange, the X-ray luminosity function spans the range between $28< log L_X [erg/s]< 32$, while old solar like \nstars show values \n$26< log L_X [erg/s]< 27$ \\citep{fava03,feig07}. This property allows us to distinguish in a very efficient way, \nmembers in young clusters from field stars expected to be typically older and fainter \nin the X-ray band. The X-ray data can be used here as a membership criterion independent from the spectroscopic\nmethods discussed before. \n\nWe used here the X-ray catalog compiled in \\citet{jeff09} obtained by using two EPIC-XMM-Newton observations \nperformed in 2001. Of the 276 individual sources detected considering the two observations,\n260 (255 plus additional five sources with optical counterparts with flagged photometry)\nhave been found in \\citet{jeff09} to have an optical counterpart within 6 arcsec, with a\nvery low fraction of expected spurious matches in the PMS region of the CMD where most of the cluster\nmembers are expected to be found. \n\nUnfortunately, the XMM-Newton observations cover a field of view of about 30 arcmin in diameter,\nwhere  only 307 of the GES targets fall. Of them, only 106 have an X-ray counterpart in the \\citet{jeff09}\ncatalog. To these 106 sources we added a further 4 targets (CNAME: J08092860-4720178,\n           J08093332-4718502,\n           J08093364-4722285,\n           J08093920-4721387) \n not included in the \\citet{jeff09} X-ray catalog, despite having a clear X-ray counterpart from \n visual inspection of the  available public EPIC-XMM observations of this field.\n \n In addition, there are 5 X-ray undetected optical sources (CNAME:  \nJ08092576-4730559, J08093321-4722596,  J08094171-4726420, J08094519-4719061, J08103074-4726219) \nin the  \\citet{jeff09} catalog \n  which have an ambiguous X-ray identification, being  \n  close to intense X-ray sources or located in region\n with very high background. As in the  \\citet{jeff09} catalog, we leave these objects as X-ray undetected\nand then we do not consider them as X-ray candidate members.\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{xmem} shows the spatial distribution and the CMD of the 307 targets observed with GES\nfalling  in the EPIC XMM-Newton field of view (FOV) and the 110 X-ray detections. \nThe CMD shows that most of the X-ray detected GES targets  follow the cluster region \nbetween the 1 and 10\\,Myr isochrones, while  the X-ray undetected targets are outside the cluster region.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{xray_mem.ps}\n\\caption{Spatial distribution (panel a) and CMD  (panel b) of all GES targets (dots).

This implies that in general\n the sample of active stars includes the accretors, at least when the $\\alpha_c$ index is defined,\n and thus we  did not consider here the accretion as a further membership criterion.\nWe are left with at most 6 independent criteria.\n\nWe considered  the gravity index and the photometric criterion  \nas  necessary  conditions for cluster membership.\nA further necessary requirement for cluster membership is the dynamical \ncondition based on the RVs, except for stars identified as binaries and fast rotators\n($vsini>50$\\,km/s). Indeed, the RVs of these objects  can be affected by the presence of double line series \n(SB2) or by the RV of one of the two stellar components (SB1). In the case of late type fast rotators, the RVs \nare strongly affected by the simultaneous presence of molecular bands and broadening of the spectral lines\ndue to the rotation. Thus, even in these cases, the RVs can be affected by very large errors and cannot be used \nas a necessary condition to select cluster members.\n\nThe other criteria,  i.e. the EW(Li), \nthe activity index from the H$_\\alpha$ line and the X-ray emission are age indicators and\nare used here to confirm the membership\\footnote{This choice automatically excludes \nany unidentified short period binaries with RVs outside the cluster RV range.}.\n\nIn summary, to  define {\\it confirmed members} we required \nthat all the following conditions must be fulfilled:\n(a) they are members based on their gravity and photometry; (b) they are members for RV; this condition\nis not applied to binaries and/or fast rotators; (c)\nthey are young i.e. they are members based on their Li or   H$\\alpha$ index or  X-ray emission.\nThe conditions (a) and (b) are inclusive of all possible candidates but have the \ndisadvantage of also including a fraction of contaminants. However with the condition (c) we are\nconfident of cutting the contamination very significantly.  \nThe three youth indicators are sensitive in a different way \nto the spectral types and, in some sense, are complementary, and then they  \nare used independently  to ensure  the coverage of the entire spectral type range, especially\nwhere the contamination is worst. In fact,\nthe Li indicator is most sensitive to age in the K- and M-type objects \n(apart from the narrow window in V-I where Li-depleted M-dwarfs are found),\n but is less effective for G-type stars. On the other hand, the rapid spin-down \nof G-type stars means that X-ray activity is a more effective youth indicator \nin G- and K-type stars, but less effective for M-type stars with their longer \nspin-down and activity timescales \\citep[e.g. see discussion in][]{jeff14a}.\n\nWe also note that the three age indicators\n have a different sensitivity to the stellar ages. In fact,\ndepending on the stellar mass, the lithium depletion starts within few million years,\nand then very high EW(Li) values allow us to distinguish very young stars. \nThe X-ray emission and the chromospheric activity are also decreasing as a function of stellar ages \nbut with longer time scale and are very efficient to select low mass stars younger than a few 100\\,Myr,\nwhile \nthe EW(Li) method is more efficient in selecting stars with ages smaller than $\\sim10$\\,Myr.\n\nWe stress that condition (c) ensure us to include also Li-depleted members with the   very unlikey  risk to include\n unidentified field short period binaries at the same cluster distance and with RV consistent\nwith that of the cluster.\n\n\nWe note that  we have  optical photometric membership information for the entire data set of\n1242 stars, while  the other criteria can be applied only to subsamples.\nTable\\,\\ref{infomemtab}  \n  shows the number of objects for which each method can be applied and the corresponding\n  number of members by that method. In the case of X-ray detections,\nthe number of stars for which we have a membership indication is the total number of optical sources falling\nin the EPIC-XMM FOV.\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Number of objects for which we have a membership indication and number of candidate\ncluster members for each method\n(G=Gravity, P=Photometry, RV=radial velocities, Li=Lithium, A=chromospheric activity, X=X-ray).\n\\label{infomemtab}}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular} {c c c }  \n\\hline\\hline\nMethod & \\#info & \\#candidates \\\\\n\\hline\n                                                 G  &  1043  &   451 \\\\\n                                                 P  &  1242  &   579 \\\\\n                                                RV  &  1221  &   541 \\\\\n                                                Li  &  1122  &   225 \\\\\n                                                 A  &  1176  &   261 \\\\\n                                X\\tablefootmark{a}  &   307  &   110 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\tablefoot{\n\\tablefoottext{a}{only in the EPIC-XMM FOV}\n}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We started the selection by considering only the sample of the 312\n\ncandidates for which both the  photometry and gravity suggest \nmembership\\footnote{For  spectra with S/N$<15$\nwe considered only the photometric condition, since the gravity index in these cases is poorly\ndefined.}.\nAmong these we considered {\\it confirmed members} the 227 objects\n\nwith RV compatible with the cluster and\nat least one of the three age indicators consistent with young stars.

These models were used  to derive the stellar masses\n that are reported in Table\\,\\ref{masstablong} together with other fundamental parameters.\nThe 15 binaries classified as cluster members are treated here as single stars.\n\\addtocounter{table}{1}\n\n\n\nErrors on  masses  were computed by considering the uncertainties in photometry\nand the uncertainty in A$_V$  and E(V-I), respectively, for  magnitudes and colors,\nstarting from the uncertainty in E(B-V) (0.016), estimated in \\citet{jeff09}.\n\n\nThen, we derived  the  masses  corresponding\nto the box limits in the CMD defined by these uncertainties.\n\nSince the  \\citet{bara15} models are limited to masses smaller than 1.4\\,M$_\\odot$,\nwe derived a mass value for 237 of the 246 confirmed and possible cluster members.\nThis sample includes objects with masses \nbetween 0.16 and 1.3\\,M$_\\odot$. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{masses_ages_bhac15.ps}\n\\caption{Color magnitude diagram of the confirmed (dots) and possible members (crossed dots).\nTheoretical tracks and isochrones (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 \\,Myr) \nby \\citet{bara15} are also shown with solid and dotted lines, respectively.}\n\\label{massages}\n \\end{figure}\n\n  \n\\section{Discussion}\n\\subsection{Efficiency of the cluster membership methods}\nAs stated in the previous section, to define cluster members we required that the stars \nhave photometric and dynamic (RV)  properties consistent with that of the cluster.\nFrom this sample we discarded  giants by using the  gravity index and this\nallowed us to reduce significantly the fraction of contaminants.\n\nThe three age indicators (EW(Li), $\\alpha_c$  and X-rays)  \n have been used to confirm the cluster membership.\n In most cases all the three indicators are consistent but we \nhave  targets for which only one or  two criteria give us information on their young age.\nThis can occur for physical reasons, for example if a star already depleted  lithium,\nor if a star does not show X-ray emission,  or for observational reasons,\nfor example if  X-ray sensitivity was not sufficient to detect the object.\nFor this reason, to confirm the\nmembership it is sufficient that at least one of the three age indicators is positive.\n\nThe results of our membership strategy are given in Table\\,\\ref{histxmemtab}\nfor members within the EPIC-XMM FOV, \nfor which we have 6 membership criteria and in particular 3 age indicators.\nIn this table we give the number of confirmed members \nand the number of objects for which we have a membership indication, \n for each age indicator. The fraction of confirmed members found\n with each method with respect  to the total sample of confirmed members is also given.\n Finally, we counted the number of members we would miss if we did not consider that method.\n The same information is given by splitting the samples in three different color ranges.\n \n The analogous values are given in Table\\,\\ref{histnoxmemtab} where we consider \n confirmed members outside of the EPIC-XMM FOV,  \nfor which we have 5 membership criteria and in particular 2 age indicators.\n\n\nThe lowest efficiency of the EW(Li) method for V-I$\\lesssim$1, roughly corresponding to masses \n$>$1\\,M$_\\odot$, is due to the rapid formation of the radiative core that prevents the Li depletion.\nThus in this spectral range, the EW(Li) is not very effective in selecting young stars.\n\nIn general, these results suggest that all the methods are very effective, being positive  for at least \n$\\sim$80\\% of stars. They are least effective in the regime of M-type stars where some members can be missed.\nFor this reason it is crucial to use,  in this spectral range, several age indicators.\n\nThe efficiency of the EW(Li) is slightly smaller (about 82\\%) than the other methods \n for V-I$>$2.4.  The presence of Li is  an extremely effective age indicator in M-dwarfs since the selected\nstars are definitively very young  but, in the narrow colour range 2.5$<$V-I$<$3.0,\nwhere Li can be depleted, this method \n  is ineffective in the sense that some members can be missed.\n\n\n\n\n The $\\alpha_c$  index, signature of H$\\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, are not very effective in\n selecting very young stars, since also young field stars of spectral type M can \nshow H$\\alpha$ and/or X-ray emission.\nBut,  if on one hand these methods have the disadvantage to include some  contaminants,\non the other hand, with these methods\nall potential cluster members can be selected. Members can be missed only for observational limitations\ni.e. when    the  S/N of the spectra is $<15$, and then the index cannot be defined, or if they are objects\nvery close to very strong X-ray emitters (M-type stars   are typically less bright in X-rays) \nor faint objects for which  the X-ray detection probability is low. Spectra with high S/N and/or  \nX-ray observations with high spatial resolution   are required to efficiently use these methods.\n\nWe find  that within the XMM FOV, the  members not retrieved with the Li line are 16, \n\n(14 of them are undefined according to Li)\nwhile those not identified  with the H$\\alpha$\nand X-ray methods are 9,  over a total of 103 members. \nThe last column of Tab.\\,\\ref{histxmemtab} gives the total number of members minus\nthe number of members recovered by all other methods but independently from the method\nindicated in the line. This tells us the number of members that we would miss if we did not use that method.\nThus, within the XMM FOV, the three methods are equivalent and then if we did not \nuse one of them we could still select an almost complete sample of members. \n\nThe same is not true\nif we consider the results in the region outside the XMM FOV where we note that 13 and 29 members \nwould be missed if we did not use the Li or the activity index, respectively. The first group are \nmainly the objects with V-I$>$2.7 that were identified from  their very large EW(Li) that would likely be missed by\nthe chromospheric activity method since their spectra have S/N smaller than that required, while the latter group \nincludes mainly members with $2.5<$V-I$<3.0$ and EW(Li)$<$100\\,m$\\AA$ (18 objects)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  We note that this is the region where we estimated to find 20 members \n and  where  we did not discard candidate\nmembers by leaving the objects undefined according to the Li test (see Section\\,\\ref{lithiumsection}).\nThus, these are  members of the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster according to RV, photometry and gravity, \nthat were confirmed by their chromosperic activity.\n Even if we do not have confirmation by the Li line that they are very young members, it is very \nunlikely that they are field stars.\n\nIn general the number of members detected by X-rays or from activity is not significantly \nlarger than the members found from Li and this suggests to  us that the small differences\namong the methods are  related to their detailed  dependence \non  the spectral range and on the observational strategy. \n\nThe number of members found with the three age indicators can be used to pinpoint \n any age spread among the  members. In fact,\nas discussed in the previous section, the three  methods have also different sensitivity to cluster ages.\nAn age spread of a few Myr can only be investigated by using Li, at least for the M-dwarfs, while \n the X-rays and\nthe chromospheric activity are not really age dependent at these ages. \nSince this cluster is close\nto the Vela OB2 association, expected to be relatively young ($<100$\\,Myr), we can, in principle, find\nmore objects selected in X-rays and/or for activity rather than by  Li.  \nHowever, our results suggest that there is no  large age spread among  members since \nthe number of members selected by using the Li line is comparable to those selected by using\nthe X-ray  and the activity methods. Thus we are confident that all selected members originated from \nthe same parent molecular cloud.\n\n \\begin{table}\n\\caption{Breakdown of confirmed members in the XMM FOV.

This implies that while we are able to estimate the completeness of the\nsample of confirmed and possible members observed with GIRAFFE, we cannot estimate how complete is the sample\nof members selected with  UVES. For this reason, to derive the IMF of the cluster, \nwe do not consider  the targets observed with UVES and we\nuse only the sample of confirmed and possible members observed with GIRAFFE having\nmasses  between 0.16 and 1.3\\,M$_\\odot$.\n\nAs already mentioned in the Introduction, this cluster includes the two dynamically distinct populations, A and B.\nHowever, according to a KS test, we find that the probability that the two populations have statistically \nindistinguishable mass distributions is 43\\%. For this reason, we will not consider these two populations \nseparately in the following discussion. \n\n\n\nStarting from the  sample including the $n_{tot}=237$ \n confirmed and possible members for which we have derived the mass values,\nthe  observed  IMF has been derived \n in the linear form \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 36318, "prevtext": "\n\n   \\title{The Gaia-ESO Survey: membership and Initial Mass Function of the $\\gamma$ Velorum  cluster\\thanks{Based on\n   observations made with the ESO/VLT, at Paranal Observatory, \n   under program 188.B-3002 (The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey)  }}\n\n   \\subtitle{ }\n  \\author{L.

Due to its relatively small distance,\nit appears quite dispersed on the sky. It does not show  evidence of ongoing star formation\nand thus it is an ideal target for studies of young stars in which the accretion phenomena\nalready have almost entirely ceased \\citep{hern08}. The most massive member is $\\gamma^2$ Velorum,\na   binary system formed by a Wolf-Rayet (WC8) component of $\\sim9\\pm2$\\,M$_\\odot$  and an OIII star\nof $30\\pm2$\\,M$_\\odot$ \\citep{de-m99} whose initial masses were $\\sim 35$ and 31\\,M$_\\odot$, respectively\n\\citep{eldr09}.\n\nDiscovered in X-rays by \\citet{pozz00}, \nthe cluster was established thanks to  its relatively high spatial stellar density around \n $\\gamma^2$ Velorum,  \nwithin a region of about one square degree on the sky. \nA deep photometric survey of this cluster has been obtained by \\citet{jeff09}, who also used spectroscopic and \nX-ray data to identify the  photometric cluster sequence. \n\nThe  $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster was the first  observed in the {\\it Gaia}-ESO survey (GES)\n\\citep{gilm12}, which is a high-resolution spectroscopic survey\nusing the FLAMES instruments (both GIRAFFE and UVES) of the ESO-VLT \\citep{pasq02},\n which aims to obtain a homogeneous overview of the kinematic and chemical abundance distributions \nof several components of our Galaxy, including a  census of  $\\sim$100 open clusters  (OCs). \nIn particular, the GES observation strategy for the OCs is \nto observe with  GIRAFFE all candidate members falling spatially in the  cluster area and\nwithin the cluster locus of the color-magnitude diagrams (CMD), down to V=19 mag.\nThe aim of this strategy is to observe an unbiased and\ninclusive sample of candidate cluster members.\nThis observation strategy is adopted to achieve the GES main goals that are to kinematically characterize \nthe entire populations, and, at the same time,  \nhomogeneously derive their chemical abundances. For example, a slightly subsolar metallicity was found by\n \\citet{spin14}\nfor the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster. \nGES data allow also to perform further investigations,   for example to derive \n  fundamental stellar astrophysical parameters  and then cluster fundamental parameters, \n  such as reddening, age, distance and mass. These latter are crucial to\nconstrain cluster formation theory (star burst events, sequential star formation and age spread),\nstellar evolution models and to derive the Initial Mass Function (IMF). \n\nThe first goal of this paper is to establish the membership of the $\\gamma$ Velorum  cluster.\nStarting from an inclusive sample of candidate cluster members, \nmembership will be  confirmed or rejected by using  radial velocities (RV) and  \nstellar  properties (e.g., surface gravity, effective temperature, Li abundance,\naccretion rates, chromospheric activity, rotation)\nthat can be derived from  spectral features falling \nin the  $\\lambda\\lambda 6440-\u00e2\u0088\u00926815\\,\\AA$ spectral range, covered by the GIRAFFE HR15N set-up. \nThe sample of confirmed members is used to derive the IMF.\n\n\nIn a study dedicated to the dynamical analysis of this cluster, using the very precise RVs \nderived with GES,  \\citet{jeff14} found that  the  cluster consists of two distinct kinematic  populations,\nreferred to as A and B, with ages of about 10\\,Myr, of which population B is, on the basis of Li depletion, \njudged to be 1-2\\,Myr older than population A.\nSince the cluster is located in the region of the Vela OB2 association \\citep{de-z99}, \nthe authors conclude that   population A is the remnant of an initially much denser cluster,\nformed in a denser region of the Vela OB2 association, while  population B is\nmore extended and supervirial.\n\nThis  scenario is coherent with that \nfound  by \\citet{sacc15} who studied the RV distribution from GES data of the cluster \nNGC\\,2547, in the same direction as Vela OB2,\nand found an additional population, kinematically distinct from NGC 2547, but\nconsistent with population B of $\\gamma$ Vel  \\citep[see also][]{mape15}.\n\nIn case of the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster, it is very likely that populations A and B\nbelong to the same parent nebula,\nand, even if the two populations are kinematically distinct, \nthey are almost indistinguishable in the CMD and this implies they have very similar distance and ages.\nIn addition, they share very similar  spectroscopic properties, as already shown in \\citet{jeff14}.\nFor the aims of this work, we thus consider the two populations A and B as a single young population.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\\section{Targets and astrophysical parameters}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GES targets observed in the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster region\n  were selected as described in \\citet{jeff14}, following the GES\n  observational strategy \n (Bragaglia et al., in preparation).\n \n Candidate cluster members were observed with FLAMES at the VLT using both \n the GIRAFFE intermediate-resolution and the\n UVES high-resolution spectrographs. Details of the GES observations of the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster \n are reported in \\citet{jeff14}. \n For our analysis we use only GIRAFFE data while we do not consider UVES data since the sample\n of stars observed with  UVES is not complete, as required for our analysis.\n  Data reduction of the GIRAFFE spectra analyzed in this work  has been performed using the \n  pipeline developed at the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU)\n  in collaboration with the Keele University,\n  as will be described in Lewis et al. (in preparation).\n  \n  There were 1242 targets observed with GIRAFFE in the  field of $\\gamma$ Vel, selected \n  on the basis of their positions in the optical CMDs, but covering a very wide range around the CMD \n  cluster locus.\n   Since some targets were observed more than once, the data set includes 1802 spectra. \n\n\n\n\nThe stellar parameters used in this work were taken from the last data release (gesiDR2iDR3) of \nthe GES official archive  at the Wide\nField Astronomy Unit (WFAU) of the  Edinburgh University\\footnote{http://ges.roe.ac.uk/index.html}.\nIn particular we used the RVs from the  RecommendedAstroAnalysis table for the 1122 targets \n\nfor which the RVs are given and the RVs from the Spectrum table for the 99 targets\n\nfor which the RVs are not given  in the RecommendedAstroAnalysis table. \nThe RVs from the Spectrum table were shifted \nby -0.13\\,km/s to have the RVs in the same reference system. \nIn total we have a RV value for  1221 objects of the entire sample.\nThe errors on the RV were computed by using the \nRV precision recipe\ngiven in \\citet{jack15}. In addition, we used the projected rotational velocities {\\it vsin\\,i}\nfrom the Spectrum table, while \nthe  equivalent width  of the lithium line EW(Li), the full width   at 10\\% of the H$\\alpha$\npeak (H$\\alpha$\\,10\\%), the chromospheric equivalent width  of the H$\\alpha$ line and \nthe gravity index $\\gamma$ (defined in \\citet{dami14}), were taken from the  \nWgRecommendedAstroAnalysis table \\citep{lanz15}.\nWe also used the $\\alpha_c$ index of chromospheric activity based on GES data  from \\citet{dami14}.\nFinally, we used the optical literature photometry and the EPIC-XMM-Newton X-ray data from \\citet{jeff09}.\n\nDouble-lined  spectroscopic  binaries  (SB2) were identified  by  examining  the  shape  of  the \n cross-correlation function while SB1 were classified on the base of  their RV  in case of multiple observations\n\\citep{lanz15}. \n\n In particular, the WgRecommendedAstroAnalysis table of  the $\\gamma$ Velorum field includes \n23 SB1 and 21 SB2 stars,  respectively. \n\n\n\\section{Membership criteria}\nWe describe here all the adopted criteria used to select  candidate members of the young cluster \n$\\gamma$ Velorum. The conditions that we   applied  are all inclusive to select\nthe maximum number of possible members for each method. This implies the inclusion of a significant fraction\nof contaminants, but, as we  describe in Sect.\\,\\ref{finalmemsection}, \n  the final membership is  based on the necessary conditions from photometry, gravity, \nRV, and an age criterium. The age criterium\nis  based on either Li abundance, stellar activity, or X-ray emission, one of those criteria being sufficient.\nThis strategy ensures the selection of the maximum number of cluster members.\n\n\\subsection{Photometric membership\\label{photmem}}\nAs described before,  the survey strategy is to select \n  targets  in a photometric region of the CMD \nlarger than that expected for the cluster age. Then in the following analysis we   consider\nas high-probability photometric cluster members the 579 objects \nthat in the V vs. V-I diagram\nfall between the 0.5 and 20\\,Myr theoretical isochrones\nfrom \n\\citet{bara15}, reddened by E(V-I)=0.055 \nand $A_V=0.131$,\nat an intrinsic distance modulus of 7.76 \\citep{jeff09}, as shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{lithiuma1}. \nTo fix these age limits, we were guided by the position of the X-ray detected objects in the CMD, \nsince most of them are expected to be cluster members (see Section\\,\\ref{xraysection}) \nand thus trace the cluster sequence. With these limits we are confident of including all possible cluster members\nbut we are aware of including a large fraction of contaminants. However, since we  consider other membership \ncriteria, most of the contaminants are discarded in the final selection.\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{lithiuma1.ps}\n\\caption{Color magnitude diagram of all the 1242 targets observed in the $\\gamma$ Velorum  field (dots).\nEmpty red squares are the 579 \nphotometric candidate members and black filled circles are X-ray detected objects.\nSolid lines are  0.5  and 20\\,Myr isochrones from \\citet{bara15}. \nTypical photometric error bars are also indicated.}\n\\label{lithiuma1}\n \\end{figure}\n\nVery young stars with circumstellar disk and/or accretion \ncan also be photometrically selected  by considering the IR J-H vs. H-K diagram\nwhere they lie in the well known classical T\\,Tauri star (CTTS) locus,\nthat is a region with IR excesses well outside \nfrom the locus of the main sequence (MS) or giant stars. This is a way of including additional members, identified by the presence of discs/accretion.\nWe verified that in this cluster, only 3\nof the selected GES targets fall in the CTTS \nlocus\\footnote{these objects are selected as cluster members with the other methods adopted in this work}  and so we do not consider the IR color-color diagram\nas a useful method to select young stars in this cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Radial velocities}\n\\label{radvelsect}\nThe radial velocity membership criterion is based on the assumption that in a given cluster,\nmembers\n share similar RVs and have a narrow RV distribution. Since our sample of targets has been selected    \nphotometrically, we expect to find a fraction of contaminant field stars, having a much broader RV\ndistribution, overlapping with that of the cluster. Our aim is then to model the cluster and field  RV distributions\n to derive the RV range of cluster members.\n\nA scrupulous analysis to model the RV cluster distribution \nhas been presented in \\citet{jeff14} who considered an unbiased sample of 208  $\\gamma$ Velorum members \nand computed, for each member, the likelihood of having the observed RV. This likelihood has been\ncomputed by convolving an intrinsic RV distribution \nwith the measurement uncertainties  and the distribution of velocities expected for a given fraction\nof binaries. By using a maximum likelihood fit, it has been shown that the cluster RV distribution \nis better represented if the intrinsic RV distribution is modeled with a two-Gaussian fit,\n highlighting the presence of the two kinematic populations A and B in the direction of the $\\gamma$ Velorum  cluster.\n \nWe used the cluster probability density function (PDF) computed  by \\citet{jeff14}\\footnote{we applied a shift of -0.13\\,km/s to\nthe RVs of the model to move the values to the reference system of the RVs of our data} to derive the\nRV range where we can find cluster members. In particular,\nby computing the PDF area within a given RV range, \n\nwe fixed the \nRV limits for the cluster to the values for which the probability to find cluster members is smaller \nthan 0.003 (equivalent to 3\\,$\\sigma$ level)\nfor objects with  RV outside this range. These limits correspond to [$RV_{inf}, RV_{sup}$]=[1.8, 36.5]\\,km/s.\n\nThe number of cluster members with RVs within this range is 541 while that with \nRVs outside this range is expected to  be 0.3, so this is the best compromise to\n not miss cluster members even though this implies the inclusion of a significant fraction of contaminants.\n We are not considering here the possibility/probability that there is a population of binary systems \nwith a broader RV distribution and so  some member binaries may be missed on the basis of their RV.\n\n  In addition, for several aims  of this work,   \n  we defined also a more conservative  cluster RV  range corresponding  to a 2\\,$\\sigma$ confidence level.\n  With these conservative RV limits [$RV'_{inf}, RV'_{sup}$]=[12.3, 23.5]\\,km/s\nwe select a less complete  (we expect to miss about 5 cluster members with RV outside these limits)\nbut less contaminated sample of cluster members that, combined with other conditions, allow us to select\na fiducial sample of almost  certain cluster members. \n  \nTo compute the contaminant fraction, we fitted the field RV distribution by using \nthe entire RV data set but discarding the objects with RVs within the more conservative cluster RV range [$RV'_{inf}, RV'_{sup}$]. \nWe   modeled this  field RV distribution with a Gaussian function by using  maximum likelihood fitting and we\nfound that the RV mean of the field RV distribution  is 54.7$\\pm$1.3\\,km/s with a $\\sigma$=40.2$\\pm$0.9\\,km/s.\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{radvelmem1} shows the RV density distribution of the entire data set \n compared to \n the total PDF obtained by adding the numeric \\citet{jeff14} cluster model to  the field PDF derived by us.\nThe two distributions were normalized to the fraction of objects used to derive the two distributions. \n\nBy using this model, we computed the probability to find field stars within the  cluster [$RV_{inf}, RV_{sup}$] range\nand then the number of contaminants expected in the cluster region that amounts to 268 objects. \nWe note that the adopted field model  does not accurately describe  our data at $\\sim$0\\,km/s and  $\\sim$30\\,km/s,\nwhere there is an excess of stars in the observed distribution. This excess could be due to \nsome additional structures in the RV distribution that we do not include in our fit.\nFor example,  large uncertainties in the RV measurements  of fast rotators can introduce additional structures in the observed \ndistribution. This suggests us that the number of contaminants could be larger and so we consider our estimate \na lower limit to the true contamination. Based on the excess of our data with respect to the model we estimate that the number of\nmissed contaminats amounts to about 10\\%.\n\nIn conclusion, we consider candidate members for RV all the 541 stars with RV between   1.8 and 36.5\\,km/s.\nIn this sample we include also the binaries since the RV of the centre of mass  is supposed to share the  cluster RV distribution.\nNevertheless, since the method used to derive official GES released RVs does not ensure  that the RV of the binaries is that\nof the centre of mass, we are aware that some \nbinary members  may be missed\non the basis of their RV. \nThe same is true for fast rotators for which the RV uncertainties are typically very large.\nFor this reason, binaries and fast rotators are considered as a special sample in the final \ncluster member selection in the sense that for them   RV membership is not considered a necessary condition,\nas is, instead,  required for single stars.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{radvelmem1.ps}\n\\caption{The RV histogram for the entire data set of $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster \nshowing the entire RV range  (upper panel)\nand a zoom of the cluster range  (bottom panel) compared with the total PDF (solid line) \nobtained by adding the \\citet{jeff14} cluster model to the field PDF performed by us (thick dashed line).\nVertical dotted lines delimits the [$RV_{inf}, RV_{sup}$] range used to select  RV cluster member candidates.}\n\\label{radvelmem1}\n \\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Lithium line\\label{lithiumsection}}\n\nIn this section, we assign  cluster membership on the  basis of the \nstrength of the Li\\,{\\tiny I} 6708\\,$\\AA$ line, that is a well-known age indicator for young stars, \nsuch as those expected to be found in the $\\gamma$ Velorum  cluster.  \nAs discussed in \\citet{jeff14}, theoretical isochrones are very uncertain in predicting \nthe lithium depletion pattern and for this reason we adopt an empirical approach \naimed at highlighting the cluster locus in the EW(Li) vs. V-I diagram\nto fix the most appropriate EW(Li) thresholds for the cluster member selection. \nWith this aim  we used an initial sample  of candidate cluster members \nbased on criteria that are free  from any bias due to the  lithium line.\nIn particular  we defined a {\\it cluster member fiducial sample}\nincluding the 235 objects being both \nphotometric cluster members (as defined in Section\\,\\ref{photmem}) \nand with RV within the conservative cluster range ([$RV'_{inf}, RV'_{sup}$]) defined in the previous section. \nWe note that this sample does not include only genuine cluster members since  within the photometric cluster \nlocus a fraction of contaminants with RV within the [$RV'_{inf}, RV'_{sup}$] range is expected.\n Nevertheless the sample is strongly dominated by cluster members and can be used to trace\ntheir lithium properties. This sample will be used, as reference for the cluster,\nalso for other membership criteria described in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure\\,\\ref{lithiuma2} shows  EW(Li) vs.  V-I color where the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample},\n selected using only the RVs and the position on the CMD, is highlighted in red. \n Since this cluster is not affected by  strong reddening, the V-I colors,\n at least for cluster members, can be   considered as a good proxy for the spectral \n type \\citep{jeff09,dami14}.\n  We note that, in general, most of the candidate cluster members have EW(Li) larger than 200\\,m$\\AA$,\n with a trend depending on the spectral type, as expected from the young ages of these objects.\n Nevertheless,  candidate\n cluster members with colors  in the range 2.5$\\lesssim$V-I$\\lesssim$3,  corresponding\n to stars of spectral type M3 and M4,\n could have a much weaker line and appear to have begun to deplete their Li.\n  \n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{lithiuma2.ps}\n\\caption{The EW(Li) as a function of the color V-I for all targets observed in the $\\gamma$ Velorum  region.\nRed empty squares are  the fiducial candidate cluster members selected from their RV and the position on the CMD.}\n\\label{lithiuma2}\n \\end{figure}\n \nWe  use the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample} \nto empirically define the  cluster locus in this diagram and to distinguish the cluster population\nfrom the field stars. Since the EW(Li) of cluster members shows a pattern that depends on color,\nwe define four V-I ranges ([1.0-1.5],[1.5-2.0], [2.0-2.5] and [3.0-3.5]) where the EW(Li) distribution\nof candidate cluster members is well separated from that of the field stars. This is not the case  \nfor the bin 2.5$<$V-I$<$3.0, which is treated separately since in this color range,\nthe EW(Li) of cluster members cannot easily be \ndistinguished from those of  field stars. For each of these color ranges,\nwe assume that the EW(Li) of the candidate cluster members are drawn from an intrinsic\nGaussian distribution that is broadened by   uncertainties on the EW(Li).\nFor each color range, the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample}\nincludes few contaminants with weak lithium that likely\nbelong to the field population, so actually we are dealing with two populations.\nTherefore we modeled the EW(Li) distribution of the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample}\nwith two Gaussian components, one for the cluster (L$_C$) and one for the field (L$_F$)\nto take   account of the small  fraction of contaminants, and fitted the distribution for each\ncolor range \n\n using a maximum likelihood technique. In this step, we are only interested \nin the parameters of  the cluster (L$_C$), that\n are given in columns 2 and  3 of \n Table\\,\\ref{ewlipar}.\n  \\begin{table*}\n\\caption{Parameters  derived with the maximum likelihood fitting for the EW(Li) PDFs.\nColumn\\,1 indicates the color range, cols.\\,2 and 3 indicate the  mean and sigma of the cluster\nPDF, cols.\\,4 and 5 give the mean and sigma of the field PDF while col.\\,6 gives the fraction of field\nstars with respect to the total sample.

Figure\\,\\ref{lithiuma2} clearly shows that, \nthe fraction of  Li-poor fiducial cluster members    \n(EW(Li)$\\lesssim $100\\,m$\\AA$) with respect to the number of all observed Li-poor targets   \n(21/50=0.42)\nin this color range,  is relatively large. \nIt is significantly \nhigher than the same fractions in the other color ranges, where we find\n13/325=0.04, 3/313=0.01 and 4/83=0.05, in the V-I ranges [1.0-1.5],[1.5-2.0] and [2.0-2.5], respectively. \n\n\n\nThis suggests that a large fraction of the candidate cluster members \nwith very weak lithium and 2.5$<$V-I$<$3.0  are actually cluster members.\nOnly a small fraction of candidate cluster members, according to their RV,\nbelong to the field star population. \n\nTo estimate the number of expected cluster members among the 21 Li-poor \ncandidates selected for their RV, we need to\nestimate the number of expected contaminants.\nWe hypothesize that outside the range 2.5$<$V-I$<$3,  all the Li-poor stars are unassociated with the cluster.\nWe further assume that these objects have a similar RV distribution to any contaminating \nfield star with $2.5<$V-I$<3$. \nWe find that the number of Li-poor stars (considered as contaminants) with $1.0<$V-I$<2.5$ \nselected  within the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample}  is 20 (13+3+4) and \nthe number of  all observed Li-poor targets in the same color range is 721 (325+313+83).\nThen the number\nof Li-poor targets not included in the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample} is 721-20=701.\nThus the ratio between the contaminants in the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample}  and those\noutside the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample} is 20/701=0.028.\n\nIf we assume  the same ratio  in the 2.5$<$V-I$<$3 range, then the number of expected contaminants\nin the {\\it cluster member fiducial sample}  is 0.028*(50-21)=0.83$\\simeq$1.\nTherefore, the number  of expected Li-poor cluster members is 21-1=20. \n For this reason, we cannot rule out that Li-poor targets in this \n color range are  cluster members.  \n Since we cannot individually assign their membership based on the Li line,\n  we consider them as undefined according to Li, leaving  them the chance to be selected\n as cluster members with other membership criteria.\n \nFinally, for V-I$<$1, where most of G-type stars are expected to be found,\n\nthe strength of the lithium line  is not \n a sensitive age indicator anymore since these stars do deplete lithium on the Zero Age Main Sequence \\citep{sest03}.\n For this reason, in this color range, \n we consider as  undefined according to the Li  the 14 objects with\nEW(Li)$>100$\\,m$\\AA$, \nwhile the remaining 154 are considered non members.\n\nWe do not consider  the \n4 stars with 3.5$<$V-I$<$5 \nand  EW(Li)$<$200\\,m$\\AA$ as cluster members, since    in this color range they are expected to have\nEW(Li)$>$200\\,m$\\AA$.\n\nAfter this selection we have 225 \n\n\n\n\nobjects with EW(Li) larger than the threshold chosen in each color range,\nthat are considered cluster members according to  the Li test, 897\nnon members and\n120 objects \nthat are undefined according to Li. The last sample includes \n  the 56 objects \nfor which the EW(Li) has not been measured,\nthe 50 objects with EW(Li)$<$100\\,m$\\AA$ and 2.5$<$V-I$<$3.0, \n\nand the 14 stars with V-I$<1$ and EW(Li)$>100$\\,m$\\AA$. \n\nFigure\\,\\ref{lithium_mem2} shows the EW(Li) distribution as a function of the V-I colors, where the sample of \ncandidate cluster members selected  with the Li line is highlighted.\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{lithium_mem2.ps}\n\\caption{The EW(Li) as a function of the color V-I for all targets observed in the $\\gamma$ Velorum  region.\nRed empty circles are candidate cluster members selected for the Li line criterion, whereas blue crosses are \nthe 64  objects which are left undefined according to the Li test.}\n\\label{lithium_mem2}\n \\end{figure}\n\nFor  binary stars it is sufficient that one of the two components has an EW(Li)\n larger than the adopted threshold to consider it as a young star. \nHowever, in the case of candidate binaries, both SB1 and SB2, it is not possible\n to disentangle the  continuum of the two components. In addition, in the case of  \n  unresolved SB2 binaries not even  the two lines can be disentangled.\n This implies that the measured EW(Li) can be overestimated or underestimated. \n Nevertheless,  we considered  the binary stars as single stars,\n with the risk of missing cluster members and/or  including some contaminants,\n This is consistent with our  choice to be inclusive in the selection of candidate members  \n with each criterion taken separately.\n\\subsection{H$\\alpha$ line\\label{halphasect}}\n\nSpectra of young stars can show the H$\\alpha$ line in emission for several physical reasons, such as\nchromospheric activity or accretion of circumstellar material towards  the \nstar. This last process can also be associated with outflows from the central star. \nHowever, while  chromospheric activity affects the core of the line\nby filling it and possibly emerging as a narrow  H$\\alpha$ emission line, \naccretion and outflow processes affect the line wings causing a significant broadening. \nThe H$\\alpha$ line broadening arises from the gas motion that implies a\nstrong enhancement of the gas temperature due to\nthe shock produced when   the circumstellar material, driven by the magnetic field lines,\n impacts on the stellar surface.\nIn some case,   also a depression is observed in  the redward wing,  that  is  a signature\nof an infalling envelope \\citep{bert96}.\n\nA detailed study of the properties of the H$\\alpha$ emission profiles for the spectra observed within the Gaia-ESO \nsurvey  has been presented in \\citet{trav15}. Their analysis   highlights several \nmorphologic types of the H$\\alpha$ emission including the intrinsic emission and the   nebular contribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an age of 5-10\\,Myr \\citep{jeff09},  the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster could host young stars with accretion, outflows or\nchromospheric activity. The H$\\alpha$ emission properties from GES spectra\nfor a sample of selected members of the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster have been extensively studied by\n\\citet{fras15} who classified accretor stars by using the full width\nat 10$\\%$ of the H$\\alpha$ peak (H$\\alpha$\\,10\\%). In addition, they studied   chromospheric\nactivity by using the net H$\\alpha$\nequivalent width derived with a spectral subtraction method \\citep{fras94}. This measurement\nis based on the  removal of the photospheric flux to obtain the chromospheric emission of the line core.\nTheir analysis is restricted to the sample of 137 $\\gamma$ Velorum members selected as\nin \\citet{jeff14} with GES spectra having signal to noise ratio (S/N) $>$20.\n\nBased on the previously mentioned properties,\nthe H$\\alpha$ line shape can be used as a membership criterion since it allows us \nto distinguish accretors and young active stars  from non-active older stars.  \n\nIn the following sections we describe, starting from the entire GES data set in the $\\gamma$ Velorum field,\nhow we selected spectra with very broadened H$\\alpha$ lines,\ntypical of accretors, and spectra with narrow  H$\\alpha$ emission line, characteristic of chromospheric activity.\n\n\\subsubsection{Accretor selection \\label{accrselec}}\n\nYoung stars with accretion are usually selected as  objects with a H$\\alpha$\\,10\\% width $>270$\\,km/s\n\\citep{muze00,whit03,fras15}. By applying this condition to the entire set of GES data in the $\\gamma$ Velorum\ncluster, we select 26 objects. \nHowever, since most of the targets observed in the $\\gamma$ Velorum  field\nare M-type stars and a large fraction of them are also fast rotators, we checked if the broadening observed in the \nH$\\alpha$ line occurs also in the other spectral lines, \nrather than in the H$\\alpha$ line only, as expected in case of accretion.\n\n To this aim, we estimated\n the line spectral broadening due to rotation from the FWHM of a rotational (not limb-darkened) line profile, i.e.\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n \\Delta \\lambda_{\\rm Rot}=2\\times\\frac{\\sqrt3}{2} \\frac{vsin~i\\lambda_0}{c}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta\\lambda_{\\rm Rot}=2\\times\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\frac{vsin~{}i\\lambda_{0}}{c}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>Rot</mi></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mfrac><msqrt><mn>3</mn></msqrt><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>n</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mi>c</mi></mfrac></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06513.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n The mass bins for the IMF were chosen using the condition \n$\\Delta log M=0.15$ \n slightly larger than the typical mass errors. \nWe corrected the IMF for incompleteness  by considering for each mass bin the correction factor given by\nthe ratio between the number of all potential\nphotometric candidate  members and the number of actually observed targets.\nThese correction factors $c$ for each mass bin and the values of the corrected IMF\n($\\xi(M)=c\\xi_0(M)$)\nare given in Table\\,\\ref{imftab}.\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{IMF for the Gamma Vel cluster observed with\nGIRAFFE.

This work allowed us to obtain a list\nof cluster members whose   membership is confirmed by several criteria\nsimultaneously. In addition, thanks to the GES target selection strategy, based on an\ninclusive sample of candidate members, we were able to obtain a sample of members   \nmore than 90\\% complete.\nThese achievements are  crucial to study open clusters, usually contaminated by field stars,\nfor which assessing  membership  is in general very hard.\n\n\n\n\nThe GES spectroscopic parameters  used as membership indicators are \ni) radial velocities, \nii) equivalent withs of the lithium line, \niii)  $\\alpha_c$ index derived by \\citet{dami14} from the H$\\alpha$\nline that gives indications of  chromospheric activity and \niv) gravity $\\gamma$ index defined in \\citet{dami14}.  In addition, we used the \n optical photometry and the X-ray data of the cluster when available.\nWe obtained a complete list of possible members defined for each method and finally \na reliable and uncontaminated  as possible list of 246 confirmed members by combining all  information. \n\nIn particular, radial velocities, photometry and gravity index were used as necessary conditions\nto select individual stars, while the youth indicators, i.e. lithium, H$\\alpha$ and X-ray detections\nwere used to confirm the membership. For physical reasons or observation limits, \n youth indicators work best in different spectral regimes. For example,\nM-type stars with Li are definitely very young,\neven if the lithium depletion \ncan occur within few Myr and then stars with this spectral type can show a wide range of lithium abundance.\nThis implies that by using only the Li criterion, depending on the cluster age,\na fraction of cluster members (about 15\\% in our case)\n\n are missed. On the other hand,\n all the young stars show chromospheric activity or X-ray emission, but, depending on their spectral type,\nthey are not necessarily very young. Nevertheless, if used in combination with other conditions, \nsuch as RV, gravity and photometry,   the activity and X-ray criteria are very useful in \nselecting cluster members and allow us to recover also those \nmissed according to the Li line in the M-type spectral range.\nSince our selection starts from a sample of candidate members for RV, photometry and gravity,\nto confirm the membership the three youth indicators were used indifferently.\n\nFinally, by using the new\ntheoretical models by \\citet{bara15}, we derived the masses for 237 of the 246  confirmed and possible members\nthat are in the range [0.16,1.3]\\,M$_\\odot$.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWe derived the cluster IMF by taking into account  the incompleteness due to the unobserved\n members. We compared the derived IMF with the multiple-part power-law IMF form given in \\citet{krou01}\nand we  found that the IMF slope is  \n$\\alpha=2.6\\pm0.5$   for $0.5<M/M_\\odot <1.3$ and $\\alpha=1.1\\pm0.4$ for $0.16<M/M_\\odot <0.5$. \nThese values are consistent with a canonical IMF. \n\nFinally, we found that the total mass of the cluster component with $0.16<M/M_\\odot<1.3$ is about 100\\,M$_\\odot$\nthat is significantly lower than \nthat expected for a cluster in which   a star of $\\sim 35$\\,M$_\\odot$ formed.\nThe observed IMF suggests us that the two kinematically distinct populations  A and B found by \\citet{jeff14},\n formed from the same molecular cloud in the same global star formation process. \n\n\n\n  \n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nThis research has made use of data  products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under Programme ID 188.B-3002.

Angular momentum loss and spin-down then lead to the fading of\n chromospheric activity with age, but on a mass-dependent timescale - whilst solar-type stars will \ncease to display H$\\alpha$ emission on timescale of $\\sim 100$ Myr, there can be H$\\alpha$ emission\n in lower mass M-dwarfs even at ages of 1 Gyr and beyond \\citep{boch07}. Thus narrow H$\\alpha$ emission\n lines can be used as a mass-dependent indicator of a youthful status and thus as a condition \nto assign cluster membership in combination with other criteria.\n\nAs in \\citet{fras15},  to define active stars we considered \nthe net H$\\alpha$  equivalent width (EWHaChr) values from the GES recommended parameters, available\nfor 205 of the entire sample of observed stars. In addition,\nwe used the $\\alpha_c$ index\nderived by \\citet{dami14} that measures the  H$\\alpha$ core (2 $\\AA$ from the line center) both in cases of emission and absorption.\nIt has been measured for  1153 stars \nof our sample.\n \nFigure\\,\\ref{halphamem} shows \nthe chromospheric EW(H$\\alpha$) as a function of  the $\\alpha_c$ index (upper panel) and \nthe  $\\alpha_c$ index as a function of the V-I color (lower panel).\nIt is evident that, for  Log (EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr}))>$-0.5, the chromospheric EW(H$\\alpha$)\nis well correlated to the  $\\alpha_c$ index (upper panel). \n\n\nIn addition, most of the\ncluster members show a characteristic trend for high $\\alpha_c$ values as a function of V-I (lower panel), \nthat describes the chromospheric emission dependence on spectral type \\citep{dami14}. Objects with \nH$\\alpha$ absorption line have low $\\alpha_c$ values according to the $\\alpha_c$ index definition. \n\nSince the $\\alpha_c$ values are given for almost the entire sample of GES observed targets,\nwe  used this index to select stars with chromospheric activity. In particular,\nby following the trend of the $\\alpha_c$ index\nof the RV candidate cluster members, we define as active stars  the 242 objects with V-I$>$0.8 and\nLog\\,$\\alpha_c > 0.13(V-I)-0.25$ (dashed line) selected from spectra with S/N$>15$. \n\nThe  selected stars correspond to objects with  Log EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr})>$-0.5 that \ncan  also be considered as a threshold to select confirmed active stars. We discard objects with \nLog EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr})<$-0.5 since they \nshow very small chromospheric activity and  the EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr})$ is affected by large errors.\n\nWe added to the sample of selected active members  the 4 objects with \nLog (EW(H$\\alpha_{Chr}))>$-0.5 that were not selected in the previous step since their $\\alpha_c$ index\nis slightly smaller than the threshold we adopted.\nIn total we selected 246 candidate cluster members on the basis of their chromospheric activity,\n10 of which were already  selected as accretors.\n\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{compare_halpha_dr2dr3.ps}\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{halpha_mem.ps}\n\\caption{Upper panel shows the EW(H$\\alpha)_{Chr}$ as a function of  the $\\alpha_c$ index while\nlower panel shows the  Log $\\alpha_c$  index   as a function of the V-I color (dots).\nEmpty squares are the objects from the {\\it cluster members fiducial sample} and\n  triangles indicate the objects selected as accretors. \nFilled circles are the active candidate members selected on the basis of the $\\alpha_c$ index, \nwhile asterix symbols are those selected on the basis of the EW(H$\\alpha)_{Chr}$. \nThe dashed line\nindicates the lower limit used for the selection with the $\\alpha_c$ index.}\n\\label{halphamem}\n \\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Candidate members from gravity}\nThe $\\gamma$ index, defined using strongly gravity-sensitive lines  \\citep{dami14},\n is an efficient  gravity indicator and \n allows a clear separation between the low gravity giants and the higher gravity\nMS and PMS stars, starting from early G-type stars. Even if with a lower confidence level,\nthis index allows also to distinguish MS from PMS stars. \nFig.\\,\\ref{gravmem} shows the $\\gamma$ index as a function of the V-I color for the 1043 objects\nfor which the index has been released with the GESiDR2iDR3.\nObjects with $\\gamma \\gtrsim 1$ are  giant stars, while those in the bottom region of the plot\nare MS and PMS stars.\nBy using the  {\\it cluster member fiducial sample} \nwe see that most of them, expected to be PMS stars,\nhave $\\gamma$ index values in the upper\nenvelope of the region of high gravity objects ($\\gamma \\lesssim 1$), while MS stars lie in the lower\npart of the same envelope. \n\nWe note that this sample does not include the fast rotator stars ($vsini>30$\\,km/s)\n\n\n\nfor which the $\\gamma$ index value can be altered by the large line widths \\citep{dami14}.\n\nBased on the $\\gamma$ index,  \nwe consider high-probability cluster non members the candidate giants, i.e.  \nall the 592 objects with $\\gamma> 1.0$ and V-I$>$1.2,\n as indicated by the dashed lines in the Figure. \n\nThese objects correspond to\nstars with log\\,g$\\lesssim 3.2$ and T$_{\\rm eff} \\lesssim 5600$\\,K. \nBy using the \\citet{sies00} models,\nwe find that PMS stars with T$<5200$\\,K, older than 1\\,Myr  have log\\,g always greater than $\\sim$3.2,\n\nand therefore we are confident that the objects we are discarding are not PMS stars.\nWe consider all the remaining 648 objects as potential candidate cluster members.\n\nWe are aware that by adopting the {\\it arbitrary} limit $\\gamma=1.0$, we are including a small fraction of\ncandidate giants with $\\gamma\\lesssim1.0$ in our sample of candidate cluster members.\nThis choise is in agreement with  our strategy of being inclusive of all possible candidate cluster members.\n\nThis last sample includes the 451 stars that are MS or PMS stars and the 199 objects for which the\ngravity index is undefined and for which  membership can be assigned by using the other methods.\nWe note that with a low confidence level,  MS could be distinguished by PMS stars \nbut we adopt the inclusive approach to include in our sample of candidate cluster members even\nobjects that are MS stars. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{gravity_mem.ps}\n\\caption{Gravity index $\\gamma$ as a function of the V-I color (dots).

In particular, in the 0.5-8.0 keV\nrange, the X-ray luminosity function spans the range between $28< log L_X [erg/s]< 32$, while old solar like \nstars show values \n$26< log L_X [erg/s]< 27$ \\citep{fava03,feig07}. This property allows us to distinguish in a very efficient way, \nmembers in young clusters from field stars expected to be typically older and fainter \nin the X-ray band. The X-ray data can be used here as a membership criterion independent from the spectroscopic\nmethods discussed before. \n\nWe used here the X-ray catalog compiled in \\citet{jeff09} obtained by using two EPIC-XMM-Newton observations \nperformed in 2001. Of the 276 individual sources detected considering the two observations,\n260 (255 plus additional five sources with optical counterparts with flagged photometry)\nhave been found in \\citet{jeff09} to have an optical counterpart within 6 arcsec, with a\nvery low fraction of expected spurious matches in the PMS region of the CMD where most of the cluster\nmembers are expected to be found. \n\nUnfortunately, the XMM-Newton observations cover a field of view of about 30 arcmin in diameter,\nwhere  only 307 of the GES targets fall. Of them, only 106 have an X-ray counterpart in the \\citet{jeff09}\ncatalog. To these 106 sources we added a further 4 targets (CNAME: J08092860-4720178,\n           J08093332-4718502,\n           J08093364-4722285,\n           J08093920-4721387) \n not included in the \\citet{jeff09} X-ray catalog, despite having a clear X-ray counterpart from \n visual inspection of the  available public EPIC-XMM observations of this field.\n \n In addition, there are 5 X-ray undetected optical sources (CNAME:  \nJ08092576-4730559, J08093321-4722596,  J08094171-4726420, J08094519-4719061, J08103074-4726219) \nin the  \\citet{jeff09} catalog \n  which have an ambiguous X-ray identification, being  \n  close to intense X-ray sources or located in region\n with very high background. As in the  \\citet{jeff09} catalog, we leave these objects as X-ray undetected\nand then we do not consider them as X-ray candidate members.\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{xmem} shows the spatial distribution and the CMD of the 307 targets observed with GES\nfalling  in the EPIC XMM-Newton field of view (FOV) and the 110 X-ray detections. \nThe CMD shows that most of the X-ray detected GES targets  follow the cluster region \nbetween the 1 and 10\\,Myr isochrones, while  the X-ray undetected targets are outside the cluster region.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{xray_mem.ps}\n\\caption{Spatial distribution (panel a) and CMD  (panel b) of all GES targets (dots).

This implies that in general\n the sample of active stars includes the accretors, at least when the $\\alpha_c$ index is defined,\n and thus we  did not consider here the accretion as a further membership criterion.\nWe are left with at most 6 independent criteria.\n\nWe considered  the gravity index and the photometric criterion  \nas  necessary  conditions for cluster membership.\nA further necessary requirement for cluster membership is the dynamical \ncondition based on the RVs, except for stars identified as binaries and fast rotators\n($vsini>50$\\,km/s). Indeed, the RVs of these objects  can be affected by the presence of double line series \n(SB2) or by the RV of one of the two stellar components (SB1). In the case of late type fast rotators, the RVs \nare strongly affected by the simultaneous presence of molecular bands and broadening of the spectral lines\ndue to the rotation. Thus, even in these cases, the RVs can be affected by very large errors and cannot be used \nas a necessary condition to select cluster members.\n\nThe other criteria,  i.e. the EW(Li), \nthe activity index from the H$_\\alpha$ line and the X-ray emission are age indicators and\nare used here to confirm the membership\\footnote{This choice automatically excludes \nany unidentified short period binaries with RVs outside the cluster RV range.}.\n\nIn summary, to  define {\\it confirmed members} we required \nthat all the following conditions must be fulfilled:\n(a) they are members based on their gravity and photometry; (b) they are members for RV; this condition\nis not applied to binaries and/or fast rotators; (c)\nthey are young i.e. they are members based on their Li or   H$\\alpha$ index or  X-ray emission.\nThe conditions (a) and (b) are inclusive of all possible candidates but have the \ndisadvantage of also including a fraction of contaminants. However with the condition (c) we are\nconfident of cutting the contamination very significantly.  \nThe three youth indicators are sensitive in a different way \nto the spectral types and, in some sense, are complementary, and then they  \nare used independently  to ensure  the coverage of the entire spectral type range, especially\nwhere the contamination is worst. In fact,\nthe Li indicator is most sensitive to age in the K- and M-type objects \n(apart from the narrow window in V-I where Li-depleted M-dwarfs are found),\n but is less effective for G-type stars. On the other hand, the rapid spin-down \nof G-type stars means that X-ray activity is a more effective youth indicator \nin G- and K-type stars, but less effective for M-type stars with their longer \nspin-down and activity timescales \\citep[e.g. see discussion in][]{jeff14a}.\n\nWe also note that the three age indicators\n have a different sensitivity to the stellar ages. In fact,\ndepending on the stellar mass, the lithium depletion starts within few million years,\nand then very high EW(Li) values allow us to distinguish very young stars. \nThe X-ray emission and the chromospheric activity are also decreasing as a function of stellar ages \nbut with longer time scale and are very efficient to select low mass stars younger than a few 100\\,Myr,\nwhile \nthe EW(Li) method is more efficient in selecting stars with ages smaller than $\\sim10$\\,Myr.\n\nWe stress that condition (c) ensure us to include also Li-depleted members with the   very unlikey  risk to include\n unidentified field short period binaries at the same cluster distance and with RV consistent\nwith that of the cluster.\n\n\nWe note that  we have  optical photometric membership information for the entire data set of\n1242 stars, while  the other criteria can be applied only to subsamples.\nTable\\,\\ref{infomemtab}  \n  shows the number of objects for which each method can be applied and the corresponding\n  number of members by that method. In the case of X-ray detections,\nthe number of stars for which we have a membership indication is the total number of optical sources falling\nin the EPIC-XMM FOV.\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Number of objects for which we have a membership indication and number of candidate\ncluster members for each method\n(G=Gravity, P=Photometry, RV=radial velocities, Li=Lithium, A=chromospheric activity, X=X-ray).\n\\label{infomemtab}}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular} {c c c }  \n\\hline\\hline\nMethod & \\#info & \\#candidates \\\\\n\\hline\n                                                 G  &  1043  &   451 \\\\\n                                                 P  &  1242  &   579 \\\\\n                                                RV  &  1221  &   541 \\\\\n                                                Li  &  1122  &   225 \\\\\n                                                 A  &  1176  &   261 \\\\\n                                X\\tablefootmark{a}  &   307  &   110 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\tablefoot{\n\\tablefoottext{a}{only in the EPIC-XMM FOV}\n}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We started the selection by considering only the sample of the 312\n\ncandidates for which both the  photometry and gravity suggest \nmembership\\footnote{For  spectra with S/N$<15$\nwe considered only the photometric condition, since the gravity index in these cases is poorly\ndefined.}.\nAmong these we considered {\\it confirmed members} the 227 objects\n\nwith RV compatible with the cluster and\nat least one of the three age indicators consistent with young stars.

The fraction of confirmed members found\n with each method with respect  to the total sample of confirmed members is also given.\n Finally, we counted the number of members we would miss if we did not consider that method.\n The same information is given by splitting the samples in three different color ranges.\n \n The analogous values are given in Table\\,\\ref{histnoxmemtab} where we consider \n confirmed members outside of the EPIC-XMM FOV,  \nfor which we have 5 membership criteria and in particular 2 age indicators.\n\n\nThe lowest efficiency of the EW(Li) method for V-I$\\lesssim$1, roughly corresponding to masses \n$>$1\\,M$_\\odot$, is due to the rapid formation of the radiative core that prevents the Li depletion.\nThus in this spectral range, the EW(Li) is not very effective in selecting young stars.\n\nIn general, these results suggest that all the methods are very effective, being positive  for at least \n$\\sim$80\\% of stars. They are least effective in the regime of M-type stars where some members can be missed.\nFor this reason it is crucial to use,  in this spectral range, several age indicators.\n\nThe efficiency of the EW(Li) is slightly smaller (about 82\\%) than the other methods \n for V-I$>$2.4.  The presence of Li is  an extremely effective age indicator in M-dwarfs since the selected\nstars are definitively very young  but, in the narrow colour range 2.5$<$V-I$<$3.0,\nwhere Li can be depleted, this method \n  is ineffective in the sense that some members can be missed.\n\n\n\n\n The $\\alpha_c$  index, signature of H$\\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, are not very effective in\n selecting very young stars, since also young field stars of spectral type M can \nshow H$\\alpha$ and/or X-ray emission.\nBut,  if on one hand these methods have the disadvantage to include some  contaminants,\non the other hand, with these methods\nall potential cluster members can be selected. Members can be missed only for observational limitations\ni.e. when    the  S/N of the spectra is $<15$, and then the index cannot be defined, or if they are objects\nvery close to very strong X-ray emitters (M-type stars   are typically less bright in X-rays) \nor faint objects for which  the X-ray detection probability is low. Spectra with high S/N and/or  \nX-ray observations with high spatial resolution   are required to efficiently use these methods.\n\nWe find  that within the XMM FOV, the  members not retrieved with the Li line are 16, \n\n(14 of them are undefined according to Li)\nwhile those not identified  with the H$\\alpha$\nand X-ray methods are 9,  over a total of 103 members. \nThe last column of Tab.\\,\\ref{histxmemtab} gives the total number of members minus\nthe number of members recovered by all other methods but independently from the method\nindicated in the line. This tells us the number of members that we would miss if we did not use that method.\nThus, within the XMM FOV, the three methods are equivalent and then if we did not \nuse one of them we could still select an almost complete sample of members. \n\nThe same is not true\nif we consider the results in the region outside the XMM FOV where we note that 13 and 29 members \nwould be missed if we did not use the Li or the activity index, respectively. The first group are \nmainly the objects with V-I$>$2.7 that were identified from  their very large EW(Li) that would likely be missed by\nthe chromospheric activity method since their spectra have S/N smaller than that required, while the latter group \nincludes mainly members with $2.5<$V-I$<3.0$ and EW(Li)$<$100\\,m$\\AA$ (18 objects)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  We note that this is the region where we estimated to find 20 members \n and  where  we did not discard candidate\nmembers by leaving the objects undefined according to the Li test (see Section\\,\\ref{lithiumsection}).\nThus, these are  members of the $\\gamma$ Velorum cluster according to RV, photometry and gravity, \nthat were confirmed by their chromosperic activity.\n Even if we do not have confirmation by the Li line that they are very young members, it is very \nunlikely that they are field stars.\n\nIn general the number of members detected by X-rays or from activity is not significantly \nlarger than the members found from Li and this suggests to  us that the small differences\namong the methods are  related to their detailed  dependence \non  the spectral range and on the observational strategy. \n\nThe number of members found with the three age indicators can be used to pinpoint \n any age spread among the  members. In fact,\nas discussed in the previous section, the three  methods have also different sensitivity to cluster ages.\nAn age spread of a few Myr can only be investigated by using Li, at least for the M-dwarfs, while \n the X-rays and\nthe chromospheric activity are not really age dependent at these ages. \nSince this cluster is close\nto the Vela OB2 association, expected to be relatively young ($<100$\\,Myr), we can, in principle, find\nmore objects selected in X-rays and/or for activity rather than by  Li.  \nHowever, our results suggest that there is no  large age spread among  members since \nthe number of members selected by using the Li line is comparable to those selected by using\nthe X-ray  and the activity methods. Thus we are confident that all selected members originated from \nthe same parent molecular cloud.\n\n \\begin{table}\n\\caption{Breakdown of confirmed members in the XMM FOV.

This implies that while we are able to estimate the completeness of the\nsample of confirmed and possible members observed with GIRAFFE, we cannot estimate how complete is the sample\nof members selected with  UVES. For this reason, to derive the IMF of the cluster, \nwe do not consider  the targets observed with UVES and we\nuse only the sample of confirmed and possible members observed with GIRAFFE having\nmasses  between 0.16 and 1.3\\,M$_\\odot$.\n\nAs already mentioned in the Introduction, this cluster includes the two dynamically distinct populations, A and B.\nHowever, according to a KS test, we find that the probability that the two populations have statistically \nindistinguishable mass distributions is 43\\%.
