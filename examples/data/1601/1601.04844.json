The amplitude $\\Gamma_0(p,t)$ refers to the transition between the $^{234}$U and $^{232}$U ground states. The selected normalization assures that $S_0(p,t) = 100$ for the ground state transition.\n\nTo see the role of the two-phonon and pairing-vibrational excitations in the QPM calculations, we performed  simple QPM (SQPM) calculation using the Nilsson potential plus monopole pairing\ninteraction (Nilsson parameters $\\kappa$ and $\\mu$ taken from Ref.~\\cite{Sol76}, deformation\nparameters $\\epsilon_2 =0.192$, $\\epsilon_4=-0.008$ and pairing gaps $\\Delta_p =0.706$ MeV,  $\\Delta_n=0.602$ MeV for $^{232}$U and\n$\\epsilon_2 =0.200$, $\\epsilon_4=-0.073$ and pairing gaps $\\Delta_p =0.738$ MeV, $\\Delta_n=0.582$ MeV for $^{234}$U from\nRefs.~\\cite{Mol95,Mol97}) plus isoscalar and isovector quadrupole-quadrupole and octupole-octupole interactions. Only\none-phonon RPA states were taken into account  in these calculations. Energies of two-quasiparticle $0^+$ states were estimated from the BCS theory.\nThe model predicts 15 neutron two-quasiparticle states of the structure $\\alpha^{\\dag}_q \\alpha^{\\dag}_{\\bar{q}}$ below 4 MeV that correspond to broken neutron pairs\nsensitive to two-neutron transfer. The energies and normalized relative transfer strengths are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:QPM-BCS}(a) for $S_n(p,t) \\ge 0.01$ and compared to the experimental energies and relative transfer strengths. It is evident that the two-quasiparticle $0^+$ states represent only a minor contribution to the total relative transfer strength (cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:QPM-BCS}(c)).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering \\epsfig{file=fig11.eps, width=8 cm, angle=0} \\caption{\n\\label{fig:QPM-BCS}\n(Color online) Comparison of experimental and BCS in panel (a), SQPM and QPM in panel (b) 0$^+$ (p,t) normalized relative  strengths. The value for the 0$^+_{g.s.}$ is normalized to 100.\n    The experimental increments of the (p,t) strength in comparison to the QPM, SQPM and BCS calculations are shown in the lower panel (c).}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe strengths of the isocalar and isovector\nquadrupole-quadrupole interactions in the SQPM, $\\kappa^{(0)}_{20}$ and $\\kappa^{(1)}_{20}$, respectively, were varied to fit the experimental\nenergies and (p,t) spectroscopic strengths of the lowest $0^+$ states. It was found that an effect of $\\kappa^{(1)}_{20}$ on the (p,t) spectroscopic strengths is negligible and that\n$\\kappa^{(0)}_{20}$ significantly influences only energy and spectroscopic strength of the first $0^+$ excited state.\nIt is known that in the even-even actinides the phonon coupling does not spoil the coherence of pairing correlations in the lowest $0^+$ excited state \\cite{LoI05}. As a consequence, the state has a pronounced pairing-vibrational character that manifests itself by large RPA backward $\\phi$ amplitudes. From Fig.~\\ref{fig:lowest0+} one can see that the contribution $S^{\\phi}_n$(p,t) of the backward RPA amplitudes to the normalized relative transfer spectroscopic strength $S_n$(p,t) is important for the first excited $0^+$ state, thus indicating its pairing vibrational character. The pairing interaction is essential for reproducing the experimental relative transfer strength of the first excited $0^+$ state. If we artificially lower the neutron and proton pairing interaction strengths and simultaneously change the isoscalar quadrupole-quadrupole interaction to fit the experimental energy of the first excited $0^+$ state both $S^{\\phi}_n$(p,t) and $S_n$(p,t) rapidly drop down. The SQPM predicts $B(E2)= 4$ W.u. for the transition from the first excited $0^+$ state to the $2^+$ member of the g.s. band, the QPM gives a slightly lower value of 2.3 W.u. Therefore, we can assume that the lowest $0^+$ excited state ($0_2^+$) has a mixed pairing-vibrational and $\\beta$-vibrational character. The contribution of $S^{\\phi}_n$(p,t) for higher excited $0^+$ states in the SQPM is significantly lower and in most cases negligible, thus indicating their\nweak phonon-vibrational or two-quasiparticle character. The maximum value of the number of quasiparticles with the quantum number $q$ in\nthe ground state, $n^{20}_{max}$, measures the ground-state correlations and can be calculated from (see \\cite{Web98}):\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 72256, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\\title{Spectroscopy of $^{232}$U in the (p,t) reaction: More information on  $0^+$ excitations }\n\n\n\\author{A.~I.~Levon$^{1}$, P.~Alexa$^{2}$,\n G.~Graw$^{3}$, R.~Hertenberger$^{3}$, S.~Pascu$^{4}$,\n P.~G.~Thirolf$^{3}$,  and H.-F.~Wirth$^{3}$ }\n\n\\affiliation{$^1$ Institute for Nuclear Research, Academy of Science, Kiev, Ukraine}\n\\email[Electronic address: ] {levon@kinr.kiev.ua}\n\n\\affiliation{$^2$ Institute of Physics and Institute of Clean Technologies,  Technical\nUniversity of Ostrava, Czech Republic}\n\n\\affiliation{$^3$ Fakult\\\"at f\\\"ur Physik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\\\"at M\\\"unchen, Garching,\nGermany}\n\n\\affiliation{$^4$ H.~Hulubei National Institute of Physics and Nuclear\nEngineering, Bucharest, Romania}\n\n\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n\n The excitation spectra in the deformed nucleus $^{232}$U have been studied by means of\nthe (p,t) reaction, using the Q3D spectrograph facility at the Munich Tandem accelerator.

Subsequent analysis is performed within the\ndistorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA).\nIn addition to our studies on the actinide nuclei $^{230}$Th, $^{228}$Th, $^{232}$U,\nthe neighbouring odd nucleus $^{229}$Pa~\\cite{Wir04}, and  most recently on\n$^{240}$Pu~\\cite{Spi13},\nthe majority of studies on 0$^+$ excitations was carried out in the regions of rare earth,\ntransitional and spherical nuclei~\\cite{Les02,Mey06,Buc06,Bet09,Ili10,Ber13}.\nMost of these studies were limited to measuring the energies\nand excitation cross sections of $0^+$ states.\nTherefore they provided only the trend of changes in the nuclei contributing to such\nexcitations in a wide range of deformations: from transitional nuclei (Gd region) to\nwell-deformed (Yb region), gamma-soft (Pt region) and spherical nuclei (Pb region).\nThe main result of these studies is the observation of the dependence of the\nnumber of $0^+$ states as a function of valence nucleon numbers.\nA particularly large number of low-lying states was interpreted as a signature of a\nshape phase transition (Gd region), and the sharp drop of the number\nof  low-lying $0^+$ states  was interpreted  as a result of proximity to the shell closure.\nA particularly interesting result was obtained from the statistical analysis of\nthe distribution of $0^+$ energies: using the Brody distribution function suggests\nthat the spectrum of these excitations is intermediate between ordered and chaotic character.\nMore information from the (p,t) experiments, as well as on the  $0^+$ excitations\nin even nuclei, was given in Refs.~\\cite{Buc06,Lev09,Lev13}.\nThey report data on spins and cross sections for all states observed in the (p,t) reaction.\nThis allowed to extract information about the moments of inertia for the bands built\non the $0^+$ states.\nThese experimental studies contributed to the development of theoretical calculations,\nwhich explain some of the features of the $0^+$ excitation spectra.\nSome publications have dealt with the microscopic approach~\\cite{LoI04,LoI05},\nbut the majority of studies used the phenomenological model of interacting\nbosons (IBM)~\\cite{Zam02,Sun03}.\nThese approaches have been used also in Ref.~\\cite{Buc06,Lev09,Lev13}. Nevertheless, the nature\nof multiple $0^+$ excitations in even nuclei is still far from being understood~\\cite{She08}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n   \\epsfig{file=fig1.eps, width=12cm,angle=0}\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:spec232u_5deg}\n        Triton energy spectrum from the $^{234}$U(p,t)$^{232}$U reaction (E$_p$=25 MeV) in\n        logarithmic scale for a detection angle of 5$^\\circ$.

A short report\non this topic was presented in Ref.~\\cite{Wir04}.\nThis analysis is similar to the one carried out for the nuclei $^{228}$Th and\n$^{230}$Th~\\cite{Lev09, Lev13}.\nThe nucleus $^{232}$U is located in the region of strong quadrupole deformation, where\nstable reflection-asymmetric octupole deformations occur.\nInformation on excited states of $^{232}$U is rather scarce~\\cite{Bro06}:\nthey have been studied via $^{232}$Pa $\\beta^-$ decay, $^{232}$Np electron capture decay,\n$^{236}$Pu $\\alpha$ decay and via the  $^{230}$Th($\\alpha$,2n$\\gamma$) and\n$^{232}$Th($\\alpha$,4n$\\gamma$) reactions.\nThe study of the (p,t) reaction adds to this information considerably: data are obtained\nfor 162 levels in the energy range up to 3.25 MeV.\nBesides 0$^+$ states, where the number of reliable assignments could be increased from 9\nto 13 states in comparison to the preliminary analysis in Ref.~\\cite{Wir04},\ninformation on the spins up to 6$^+$ for many other states was obtained.\nSome levels are grouped into rotational bands, thus allowing to derive the moment of inertia\nfor some $0^+$, $2^+$ and $0^-$, $1^-$, $2^-$, $3^-$ bands.\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:ExAnRe} Experiment details and   results}\n\n\\subsection{ \\label{sec:det_exp} Details of the experiment}\n\nThe (p,t) experiment has been performed at the Tandem accelerator of the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratory\nof the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\\\"at and Technische Universit\\\"at M\\\"unchen.\nA radioactive target of  100 $\\mu$g/cm$^2$ $^{234}$U with half-life T$_{1/2}$ = 2.45$\\cdot10^5$\nyears, evaporated on a 22 $\\mu$g/cm$^2$ thick carbon backing, was bombarded with 25 MeV protons\nat an intensity of 1-2 $\\mu$A on the target.  The isotopic purity of the target was about 99\\,\\%.\nThe reaction products have been analyzed with the Q3D magnetic spectrograph  and then\n detected in a focal plane detector. The focal plane detector is a multiwire\n proportional chamber with readout of a cathode foil structure for\n position determination and dE/E particle identification \\cite{Zan91,Wir01}.\n The acceptance of the spectrograph was 11 msr, except for the most forward angle of 5$^\\circ$\n with an acceptance of 6 msr. The resulting triton spectra have a resolution of\n 4--7 keV (FWHM) and are background-free. The experimental runs were normalized to the integrated\n beam current measured in a Faraday cup behind the target.\n The angular distributions of the cross sections were obtained from the\n triton spectra at twelve different laboratory angles from 5$^\\circ$ to 50$^\\circ$ in two sets:\n the first one with higher accuracy  for energies  up to 2350 keV and the second one\n with  somewhat lower accuracy for energies from 2200 to 3250 keV.\n\n A triton energy spectrum measured at a detection angle of 5$^\\circ$ is shown in\n Fig.~\\ref{fig:spec232u_5deg}. At this angle, the 0$^+$ states have comparatively\n large cross sections. The analysis of the triton spectra was performed using\n the program GASPAN \\cite{Rie91}.  For the calibration of the energy scale,\nthe triton spectra from the reactions $^{184}$W(p,t)$^{182}$W and\n $^{186}$W(p,t)$^{184}$W  were measured at the same magnetic settings.\n The known levels in $^{232}$U \\cite{Bro06} and the levels in $^{228}$Th known from\n the study \\cite{Lev13} were also included in the calibration.\n\n The peaks in the energy spectra for all  twelve angles were identified for 162 levels.\n The information obtained for these levels is summarized in  Table~\\ref{tab:expEI}.\n The energies and spins of the levels as derived from this study are compared\n to known energies and spins from \\cite{Bro06}. They are given in the first four columns.\n The column labelled $\\sigma_{\\mbox{integ.}}$ gives the cross section integrated\n in the region from 5$^{\\circ}$ to 50$^{\\circ}$.  The column entitled\n{$\\sigma_{\\mbox{exp.}}/\\sigma_{\\mbox{calc.}}$} gives the ratio of the integrated cross sections, obtained\nfrom experimental values, from calculations in the DWBA approximation (see Sec. \\ref{sec:DWBA}).\nThe last column lists the notations of the schemes used in the DWBA calculations: sw.jj means\none-step direct transfer of the $(j)^2$ neutrons in the (p,t)

analysis}\n\nWe assume that a {\\it(lj)} pair transferred in the (p,t) reaction  is  coupled to spin zero,\nand that  the overall shape of the angular\ndistribution of the cross section is rather independent of the specific structure of the\nindividual states, since the wave function of the outgoing tritons is restricted to the nuclear\nexterior and therefore to the tails of the triton form factors.  At the same time, cross sections\nfor different orbits have to differ strongly in magnitude. To verify this assumption, DWBA\ncalculations of angular distributions for different $(j)^2$ transfer configurations to states\nwith different spins were carried out in our previous paper \\cite{Lev09}. Indeed, the magnitude\nof the cross sections differs  strongly for different orbits, but  the shapes of\ncalculated angular distributions are very similar. Nevertheless, they depend\n to some degree on the transfer configuration, the most pronounced being found for\n the 0$^+$ states, which is confirmed  by the experimental angular distributions.\n This is true for most of the {\\it(lj)} pairs and only for the case of a one-step transfer.\nNo complication of the angular distributions is expected for the excitation\nof  $0^+$ states, which  proceeds predominantly via a one-step process. This is not the case for the\nexcitation of states with other spins, where the angular distribution may be altered due to\ninelastic scattering (coupled channel effect), treated here as multi-step processes.\nTaking into account these circumstances allows for a reliable  assignment of  spins for most\nof the excited states in the final nucleus $^{232}$U by  fitting the  angular distributions\nobtained in the DWBA calculations to the experimental ones. The assignment of a single spin has not been possible\n only in a few cases,  for which two or even three spin values are allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=fig2.eps, width=8 cm,angle=0}\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:schemes}\n    Schemes of the CHUCK3 multi-step\n    calculations tested with spin assignments of  excited states\n    in $^{232}$U (see Table~\\ref{tab:expEI}).}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n The magnitude and shape of the DWBA cross section angular distributions depends on\n the chosen potential parameters. We used the optical potential parameters suggested\n by Becchetti and Greenlees \\cite{Bec69}  for protons and by Flynn {\\it et al.} \\cite{Fly69}\n for tritons. These parameters have been tested via their description of angular distributions\n for the ground states of $^{228}$Th, $^{230}$Th and $^{232}$U  \\cite{Wir04}.\n Minor changes of the parameters for tritons were needed only for some $3^-$ states,\n particularly for the states at 628.8, 1051.2 and 1212.3 keV. For these states, the triton\npotential parameters suggested by Becchetti and Greenlees \\cite{Bec71} have been used.\n For each state the binding energies of the two neutrons are calculated to match the outgoing\n triton energies. The corrections to the reaction energy are introduced depending\n on the excitation energy. For more details see \\cite{Lev09}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=fig3.eps, width=8 cm,angle=0}\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:angl_distr_0+} (Color online)\n    Angular distributions of assigned $0^+$ states in $^{232}$U and\n     their fit with  CHUCK3 one-step calculations.

See text for further information. }\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n The coupled-channel approximation (CHUCK3 code of Kunz \\cite{Kun}) was used in previous \\cite{Lev09,Lev13}\n and present calculations. The best reproduction of the angular distribution for the ground\n state and for the 1277.2 keV state was obtained for the transfer of the $(2g_{9/2})^2$ configuration\n in the one-step process. This orbital is close to the  Fermi surface and was considered in previous\n studies \\cite{Lev09,Lev13} as the most probable one in the transfer process.  But for $^{232}$U,\n a better reproduction of the angular distributions for other $0^+$ states is obtained  for the configuration\n$(1i_{11/2})^2$,  also near the Fermi surface, alone or in combination with the $(2g_{9/2})^2$ configuration.\nThe only exception is the state at 2917.4 keV, for which the experimental angular distribution can be\nfitted only by the calculated one for the transfer of the  $(1j_{15/2})^2$ neutron configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=fig4.eps, width=12cm,angle=0}\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:angl_distr_2}(Color online) Angular distributions of assigned\n    $2^+$ states in $^{232}$U and their fit with  CHUCK3  calculations.\n     The  $(ij)$ transfer configurations and schemes used\n    in the calculations for the best fit are given in Table~\\ref{tab:expEI}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nResults of  fitting the angular distributions for the states assigned as $0^+$ excitations are\nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:angl_distr_0+}.  The agreement between the fit and the data is\nexcellent for most of the levels. Remarks are needed only for the level at  927.2 keV.\nThe existence of this state and  the state at the energy of 967.7 keV  was established\nby the $\\gamma$ energies and the coincident  results at the $\\alpha$ decay of $^{236}$Pu \\cite{Ard94}.\nStrong evidence has been obtained that these states have\n spins $0^+$ and $2^+$ and are the members of a $K^{\\pi} = 0^+$ band. At the same time, it was noted that\n the occurrence of a 927.7 keV $\\gamma$ ray is in contradiction with the $0^+$ assignment for this state\n if this $\\gamma$ ray corresponds to a ground-state transition from the 927.7 keV state.\n Alternatively, this transition should be placed in another location.\n The measured (p,t) angular distribution for the 927.7 keV state strongly peaks\n in the forward direction, which is typical for the L = 0  transfer but the lack of a deep minimum at\n about 14 degrees  contradicts the $0^+$ assignment. The assumption that a doublet with\n spins $0^+$ and $2^+$  occurs at the energy of 927.7 keV seems to be a unique explanation of\n the experimental data. The angular distribution in\n this case  is fitted by the calculated one satisfactorily as one can see in Fig.~\\ref{fig:angl_distr_0+}.\n In order to obtain a satisfactory fit one has to assume a population of the 2$^+$ state at about 1/3 of\n the population of the 0$^+$ state. Thus we can make firm $0^+$ assignments for 12 states for energy excitations below 3.25 MeV,\n in comparison with 9 states found in the preliminary analysis of the\n experimental data \\cite{Wir04}. The assignment for the 1947.2 keV level is tentative.\n We can compare 24 $0^+$ states in $^{230}$Th and 18 $0^+$ states in $^{228}$Th\n with only 13 $0^+$ states in $^{232}$U in the same energy region.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n \\epsfig{file=fig5.eps, width=12cm,angle=0}\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:angl_distr_4635}(Color online) Angular distributions\n    of some assigned states in $^{232}$U and their fit with\n    CHUCK3 calculations: $4^+$ and $6^+$ with positive parity\n    and $1^-$, $3^-$ and $5^-$ with negative parity.\n    The  $(ij)$ transfer configurations and schemes used\n    in the calculations for the best fit are given in Table~\\ref{tab:expEI}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n \\epsfig{file=fig6.eps, width=8.0 cm,angle=0}\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:two_fit}(Color online) Angular distributions\n    for some  states in $^{232}$U for which fitting of the calculated distributions\n      for a unique spin is doubtful or not possible.

Green lines represent\n    tentative assignments.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe main goal of many studies using two-neutron transfer in the regions of rare earth, transitional\nand spherical nuclei \\cite{Les02,Mey06,Buc06,Bet09,Ili10,Ber13} was  to collect information only about the $0^+$ states, their energies\nand excitation cross sections. At the same time the states with non-zero spin are intensively excited\nin the (p,t) reaction and information about them can be obtained from the analysis of the angular distributions.\nThe main features of the angular distribution shapes for 2$^+$, 4$^+$ and 6$^+$ states are even more weakly\ndependent on the transfer configurations  only in the case of one-step transfer.\nTherefore the $(2g_{9/2})^2$, $(1i_{11/2})^2$ and $(1j_{15/2})^2$ configurations alone or in combination,\nwere used in the calculations for these states.\nThe one-step transfer calculations give a satisfactory fit of\nangular distributions for about 30\\,\\% of the states with spins different from  $0^+$ and  the inclusion of multi-step excitations for about\n70\\,\\% of the states is needed.  As in the Th isotopes\n\\cite{Lev09,Lev13}, multi-step excitations have to be included to fit the angular distributions\nalready for the $2^+$, $4^+$ and $6^+$ states of the g.s. band.\nAt least a small admixture of multi-step transfer for\nmost of the other states is required  to get a good agreement with experiment. Fig.~\\ref{fig:schemes} shows\nthe schemes of the multi-step excitations, tested for every state in those cases,\nwhere one-step transfer did not provide a successful fit.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:angl_distr_2} demonstrates the quality of the fit of  different-shaped\nangular distributions at the excitation of states with  spin $2^+$ by calculations assuming\none-step and one-step plus two-step excitations. Results of similar fits for the\nstates assigned as $4^+$, $6^+$ and $1^-$, $3^-$, $5^-$ excitations are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:angl_distr_4635}. At the same time, for a number of states, possibly due to a lack\nof statistical accuracy, a good fit of the calculated angular distributions to the experimental\nones can not be achieved for a unique spin of the final state and therefore  uncertainties\nremain in the spin assignment for such states. Some of them are demonstrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:two_fit}.\n\nThe spins and parities resulting from such fits are presented in Table~\\ref{tab:expEI},\ntogether with other experimental data.  Figure \\ref{fig:strength} summarizes the (p,t)\nstrengths integrated over the angle region 5$^\\circ$  - 50$^\\circ$ for positive parity states.\nThe sixth column in  Table~\\ref{tab:expEI} displays the ratio $\\sigma_{exp}/\\sigma_{cal}$.\nCalculated cross sections for the specific transfer configurations\ndiffer very strongly.  If  the microscopic structure of the\nexcited states is known, and thus the relative contribution of the specific $(j)^2$\ntransfer configurations to each of these states, these relationships are considered as\nspectroscopic factors. A perfect fit of the experimental angular distributions may mean\nthat the assumed configurations in the calculations  correspond to the major\ncomponents of the real configurations. Therefore,  at least the order of magnitude for\nthe ratio $\\sigma_{exp}/\\sigma_{cal}$ corresponds\nto the  actual spectroscopic factors with the exception of too large values, such as in the case of the\n$(1i_{11/2})^2$ transfer configurations used in the calculation for some $0^+$ and even $2^+$\nand $4^+$ states. Surprisingly, the shape just for this neutron configuration\ngives the best agreement with  experiment for the mentioned states.\n\nA few additional comments have to be added for the region where data about the spins and parities are known\nfrom the analysis of $\\gamma$ spectra \\cite{Bro06}.\nThe angular distributions for some  states are  very different from those calculated for\nthe one-step transfer. Therefore, they were used as examples  for other  states at higher energies\nin the analysis of the angular distributions.\nAs already  noted the difference is significant already for the 2$^+$ and 4$^+$ states of the g.s. band.\nFor example, the angular distribution for the 2$^+$ state at 47.6 keV can be used as a example for the states\nat 1301.4, 1600.2 and 1838.6 keV.\nFrom the two spins 3$^+$ and 4$^+$\nproposed for the state  at 1194.1 keV in the analysis of the $\\gamma$ spectra \\cite{Bro06}, our data clearly\nconfirm  the spin 4$^+$. Then the angular distribution for this state can  serve as an example\nfor the states at 1361.5 keV and 1604.9 keV. Importantly,\nthe angular distributions for some 2$^+$ and 4$^+$ states have a feature typical for the excitation of 0$^+$ states,\nnamely a strong peak at small angles.\n\nThe angular distribution  for the 4$^+$ state at 833.4 keV, which is known from the $\\gamma$ spectroscopy,\nis very different from the one for the one-step transfer. It was used as an example for the assignment of\nspins of the states at 1728.5 keV and 1744.4 keV with similar angular distributions.\nSimilarly, the angular distribution for the 1$^-$ state\nat 563.2 keV can serve as an example for the state at 1141.3 keV.\nThe angular distribution for the state 3$^-$ at 628.8 keV  not only differs from the one calculated\nfor one-step transfer and can be described by the scheme m3a.gg, but it is very similar\nto the angular distribution for the 2$^+$ state at one-step transfer. Therefore, for all  states\nwith similar experimental distributions,  the calculated angular distributions for the spin 2$^+$\n and 3$^-$ were tested during fitting procedure, using the scheme m3a.gg.\n\nThe states with unnatural parity populated via two neutron transfer, such as 3$^+$ at 911.9 keV\nand 2$^-$ at 1173.0 keV, represent a special case. Assignments based on the $\\gamma$-spectra analysis are tentative. As one can see\nfrom Fig.~\\ref{fig:two_fit}  these spins and parities are confirmed by fitting the angular distributions.\nSpin 3$^+$ for the states at 1552.8 and 1633.8 keV is attributed taking into account also the similarity\nof their angular distributions with those for the state at 911.9 keV.\nThe state at 1015.9 keV is excited weakly, but the angular distribution measured with small statistics\ndoes not contradict the assignment of spin 2$^-$. The same is true for the state at 1097.6 keV with spin 4$^-$.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{Disc} Discussion}\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:Col_mom} Collective bands and moments of inertia in $^{232}$U}\n\n\nAiming to get more information on the excited states in $^{232}$U,  especially\non the moments of inertia for the 0$^+$ states, we have attempted to identify\nthose sequences of  states,  which show the characteristics of a rotational band\nstructure. An identification of the states attributed to rotational bands\ncan be made on the basis of the following conditions:\na) the angular distribution for a  band member candidate  is fitted by  DWBA calculations\nfor its expected spin;\nb) the transfer cross section in the (p,t) reaction  to states in the potential band has to\ndecrease with increasing  spin;\nc) the energies of the states in the band can be fitted\napproximately by the expression for a rotational band   $E = E_0 +\nAI(I+1)$ with a small and smooth variation of the inertial\nparameter $A$. Collective bands identified in such a way\n are listed in Table~\\ref{tab:bands}. The procedure can be justified, since\n some sequences meeting the above\ncriteria are already known  to be rotational bands from gamma-ray spectroscopy\n\\cite{Bro06}. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:moments}\nwe present moments of inertia (MoI) obtained by fitting the level\nenergies of the bands displayed in Table~\\ref{tab:bands}  by the expression $E = E_0 + AI(I+1)$\nfor close-lying levels,  i.e. they were determined for  band members  using the ratio of $\\Delta\nE$ and $\\Delta [I(I+1)]$, thus saving the spin dependence of the MoI.\n\n\n\\textsl{Negative parity states.} Unlike the thorium isotopes \\cite{Lev09,Lev13}, some uncertainties in\n formation of the bands are met for $^{232}$U. At the beginning a few comments follow about\n the lowest negative-parity states, usually interpreted as of octupolar vibrational character.\n They are  one-phonon octupole excitations,  forming a quadruplet of states with\n $K^{\\pi} = 0^-, 1^-, 2^-, 3^-$ and are the bandheads for the rotational bands.\n The $K^{\\pi} = 0^-$ band is reliably established \\cite{Bro06} and confirmed by the present study.\n There are two states with $J^{\\pi} = 2^-$ at 1016.8 and 1173.1 keV, which may be members\n of bands with $K^{\\pi} = 1^-$  and $K^{\\pi} = 2^-$. The level  at 1146.3 keV  has\n been proposed as a bandhead of the $K^{\\pi} = 1^-$ band from the observation of $\\gamma$ ray\n  with this energy \\cite{Wei72}. The corresponding line in the triton spectra is absent.\n After our firm assignment of  spin 4$^+$ to the state at 1194.1 keV,  this proposal has\n to be rejected since the 1146.3 keV transition should  be referred to the decay of this\n level to the  2$^+$ level at 47.6 keV. At the same time a line in the triton spectra is observed\n at 1141.5 keV, the spin of corresponding state is assigned tentatively as 1$^-$.\nConsidering this level as the bandhead for the $1^-$ band with two levels  known from previous\nstudies \\cite{Bro06}, the moments of inertia can be calculated.\nThe procedure described above can not be applied in this case because of the mixing by\nthe Coriolis interaction. A simplified expression for the band energies can be used in the analysis\n(for details see \\cite{Lev13})\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nE(I,K^{\\pi}=1^-) \\sim E_1 +(A_1+B)I(I+1)\\enspace \\makebox{for $I$ odd}  \\nonumber \\\\\nE(I,K^{\\pi}=1^-) \\sim E_1+A_1I(I+1) \\enspace \\makebox{for $I$ even}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nConsidering $E_1$, $A_1$ and $B$ as parameters,  we obtained from the  energies of three levels\n$E_1$ = 1127.3 keV, $A_1 = 7.63$ keV and $B = -0.47$ keV. This corresponds to a moment of inertia of\n65.5 MeV$^{-1}$ (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:moments}). The difference to the moment of inertia of the $0^-$ band\nis quite large and the energy of 1173.1 keV of the 2$^-$ level of thus assumed $1^-$ band is much higher than\nthe energy of 1016.8 keV of the 2$^-$ level of the assumed the 2$^-$ band (should be the opposite).\nIf, however, we consider the  1173.1 keV state as the bandhead of the $K^{\\pi}=2^-$ band, then the moment\nof inertia is determined as 78.5 MeV$^{-1}$ close to the moment of inertia of the $K^{\\pi}=0^-$ band.\nAlthough  some ambiguity remains, the level  3$^-$ at  1264.8 keV  can be proposed as  the bandhead\nof the $K^{\\pi} = 3^-$ band.\n\nIn a more advanced model \\cite{Sol76}, that takes into account the Coriolis\ninteraction between all octupole bands, one can fit 11 parameters\n(bandhead energies, rotation parameters and Coriolis intrinsic\nmatrix elements between bandheads) to the experimental energies.\nThe former level\nassignment gives $E_0 = 551.0$ keV, $E_1 = 1136$ keV, $E_2 = 1006$ keV,\n$E_3 = 1241$ keV with $\\chi^2 = 0.97$,\nwhile the latter gives a slightly better value of $\\chi^2 = 0.63$ and\nresonable values of the fitted energies\n$E_0 = 551.6$ keV, $E_1 = 987.4$ keV, $E_2 = 1158$ keV,\n$E_3 =1240$ keV. However, the predicted $1^-$ bandhead at 994 keV is not\nobserved experimentally.\n\n\\textsl{The 2$^+$, 4$^+$ and 6$^+$ states.}\nStates with spins and parities firmly assigned as 2$^+$ excitations\n dominate in the triton spectra. Some of them are assigned as members of $K^{\\pi}=0^+$ bands\n and others  probably are bandheads and the levels with spins 4$^+$ and even 6$^+$ are identified\n as possible members of these bands. From the analysis of the $\\gamma$-spectra \\cite{Bro06}\nthe 866.8 keV state was identified as the bandhead of the $\\gamma$-vibrational band with\nmembers  911.5 and 970.7 keV. A possible continuation of this band can be the 1132.7 keV state,\nsince for this state the typical  2$^+$ angular distribution is distorted by a possible\nadmixture of a 6$^+$ state (it might be a doublet of  2$^+$ and 6$^+$ states). The 1132.7 keV\nstate was tentatively  identified as the bandhead of the  $K^{\\pi}=2^+$ in \\cite{Wei72} using\nthe analysis of the $\\gamma$ spectra. The  4$^+$ states at 1226.8 keV\nand the 6$^+$ state at 1372.0 keV  could be proposed as  members of this band. However, the cross section\nfor the 4$^+$ state  exceeds the one for the 2$^+$ state, contrary to the above conditions.\nTherefore, the $K^{\\pi} = 4^+$ band is offered as an option.\n\n\n\\textsl{The 0$^+$ states.}\nFor the state at the energy of 927.3 keV assigned in \\cite{Ard94} and\nin this study as a 0$^+$ state no members of the band were observed in the (p,t) reaction.\nThe energy 967.6 keV  was accepted for the 2$^+$ member of the band as suggested  in \\cite{Ard94}.\nThe 0$^+$ state at 1277.2 keV is strongly\n excited and the members of the assumed band  have to be excited too. A clear sequence\n of states is observed with a spin assignment of2$^+$, 4$^+$ and 6$^+$,   as can be seen\n in Table~\\ref{tab:bands}, but moments of inertia determined from this sequence are very high\n (124 MeV$^{-1}$ from the 2$^+$ and 0$^+$ state energy difference) and are decreasing as a function of spin.\n Other  possible sequences  do not meet the conditions set forth above.\n A possible\n explanation for such a behavior  was suggested in \\cite{Lev13} but it is hardly applicable\n in this case.  An assumption may be suggested\n that the structure of this state is different from other collective states.\n To some extent the same remark\n can be attributed to the band probably built on the 0$^+$ state at 1569.0 keV,\n whose moment of inertia weakly decreases as a function of spin, though weakly.\nThe 0$^+$ states at 1797.0, 1821.8  and 1861.0  keV are  also strongly excited and\n the excitation of other members of the assumed bands have to be seen in the (p,t) reaction.\n At least the 2$^+$ members  can be attributed to such bands built on the 0$^+$ states at\n 1797.0 and  1821.8 keV. For the 0$^+$ state at 1861.0  keV, no prolongation of the band\n is clearly visible in the triton spectra.\n Only the unlikely assumption can be made that the corresponding line is hidden under the 1915.2 keV line,\n  but the moment of inertia of 55.4 MeV$^{-1}$ from this assumption is much less than the one for the ground state.\n An ambiguous situation is met also for the $0^+$ state at 1931.0 keV,  whose excitation  is\n only  slightly weaker than the first excited state at 691.4 keV.\n Two different sequences may be assumed for the band built on this state, but for both the moment of\n inertia is decreasing with spin.\n As it was noted already, the angular distribution for the state at 2917.4 keV differs considerably from\nall others  and can be fitted only by the calculation for transfer of the  $(1j_{15/2})^2$\nneutron configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newcolumntype{d}{D{.}{.}{3}}\n\\begin{table*}[]\n\\caption{\\label{tab:bands} \\normalsize{The sequences of  states\nwhich can belong to rotationak bands (from  the CHUCK fit, the (p,t) cross\nsections and the inertial parameters).

The $K^{\\pi}= 0^-$ band with the bandhead\n1$^-$ at 563.2 keV is well established, it exhibits an MoI  increase of about 20\\,\\% and can serve as orientation\nfor such excitations. The assumption that the 2$^-$ level at 1173.1 keV belongs to the $K^{\\pi}= 1^-$ band\nis not confirmed by the present analysis (see above).\nIf, however, we assume that the state at 1173.1 keV is the bandhead of\nthe $K^{\\pi}=2^-$ band, then the MoI determined from the $3^{-} - 2^{-}$\nenergy difference is 78.5 MeV$^{-1}$,  only slightly higher than the MoI\nof the $K^{\\pi}=0^-$ band.\nAlthough  the ambiguity remains, the level 2$^-$ at 1016.9 keV is the member\nof the $K^{\\pi}= 1^-$ band\n(with the 1$^-$ level not observed) and  the   3$^-$ at level 1264.8 keV\ncan be proposed as  the bandhead\nof the $K^{\\pi} = 3^-$ band.\n\nUnlike in $^{228}$Th and $^{230}$Th, the MoI of the bands built on the excited 0$^+$ states\nin $^{232}$U are not much higher than  those for the g.s. band. Only two bands, starting\nat 1227.2 and 1569.0 keV, have a significant excess of the MoI. The principal difference\nis that the first excited 0$^+$ state in $^{232}$U seems to be a $\\beta$-vibrational state.  The results of\nthe analysis of $\\gamma$ spectra and the MoI value close to the one of the g.s.  give evidence for such\nconclusion. At the same time  the first excited $0^+$ state in $^{228}$Th  \\cite{Lev13}\n as well as in $^{240}$Pu \\cite{Spi13} may have an octupole two-phonon nature. The first\n excited (possible $\\beta$-vibrational) state in $^{232}$U is  most strongly excited,   just the same  as the\n the first excited (octupole two-phonon) states in $^{228}$Th and $^{240}$Pu and the first excited state\n in  $^{230}$Th with a more complicated phonon structure \\cite{Lev09}.\nIn $^{232}$U, the state at 927.3 keV was suggested in \\cite{Ard94} to be an octupole two-phonon excitation.\nIt is confirmed by the large values of the  $B(E1)/B(E2)$ ratio calculated\nusing the data on the $\\gamma$-intensities  for transitions from $0^+$ and $2^+$ levels of this band to\nthe levels of the 0$^-$ and g.s. bands \\cite{Ard94} (see discussion below and Tables \\ref{BE2/BE1_IBM} and\n\\ref{BE_SQPM}).\n\n\nThe MoI of the 927.3 keV band confirms this assignment, though it is only 16\\,\\% larger than that of the g.s.,\ncompared to a larger excess of 36\\,\\% and 23\\,\\% for $^{228}$Th and $^{230}$Th, respectively.\nAll these facts indicate that the strong population of the first excited 0$^+$ states does not allow to\nidentify their  phonon structure.\n\n\n\n\nThe value of the MoI for the band built on the  2$^+$  state at 866.8 keV is close to the one\nfor the possible $\\beta$-vibration band (they are only 6\\,\\% and 8\\,\\% larger than those of the g.s. band),\nthus confirming its interpretation as $\\gamma$-vibrational band.\nAs for the experimental evidence of the nature of other $0^+$ states, we derived only values of the MoI\n  from the sequences of states treated as rotational bands and thus only\ntentative conclusions can be drawn about their structure. In contrast to $^{230}$Th\n\\cite{Lev09},  for which they are distributed almost uniformly over the region\nuntil 1.80 of the g.s. value (equal to 56 MeV$^{-1}$) and to $^{228}$Th, for which most of values are\n in the range of 1.35 - 1.85 of the g.s. value (equal to 52 MeV$^{-1}$), most of the MoI values of\n the $0^+$ states in  $^{232}$U do not exceed the value of 1.27 of the g.s. (equal to 63 MeV$^{-1}$).\n This fact can  indicate that  the corresponding states are possibly of quadrupole one-phonon or two-phonon nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:IBM} IBM calculations}\n\nThe  Interacting Boson Model (IBM) describes the low-lying positive and negative parity states by\ntreating the valence nucleons in pairs as bosons. The positive parity states are described by\nintroducing \\(s\\) and \\(d\\) bosons, which carry angular momentum of \\(L^{\\pi}\\)=0\\(^{+}\\)\n and \\(L^{\\pi}\\)=2\\(^{+}\\), respectively, while the negative parity states can be calculated\n  by additionally including \\(p\\) and \\(f\\) bosons having \\(L^{\\pi}\\)=1\\(^{-}\\) and\n   \\(L^{\\pi}\\)=3\\(^{-}\\), respectively. In the present paper the IBM-1 version of the model\n   is used, which means that no distinction is made between protons and neutrons \\cite{Iach87}.\n   Full IBM-\\(spdf\\) calculations have been previously done with success in Refs. \\cite{Eng87,Zam01,Zam03}.\n\nThe octupole degree of freedom is well known for playing a major role in the actinide region\n\\cite{Rob12,Rob13}. In fact, octupole correlations have been predicted to be present in the\n$Z \\sim 88$ and $N \\sim 134$ region\n\\cite{Naz84} and have attracted a lot of experimental investigations\n centered on energy spectra and transition probabilities \\cite{But96}. The low-lying properties\n of these nuclei have been interpreted using a series of theoretical models, including\n the IBM \\cite{Zam01,Zam03}, which mainly concentrated on the study of electromagnetic decay properties.\n In the last years, several nuclei in this region were investigated using the (p,t) reaction and\n the  transfer intensities became available also \\cite{Wir04,Spi13}. Therefore, several models\n tried to describe the complete experimental situation \\cite{Lev13,Spi13,LoI05}.\n\nAs presented also in this paper, an increased number of 0\\(^+\\) excitations have been\npopulated in the previous two-neutron transfer experiments with a rather high\nintensity \\cite{Wir04,Lev09,Lev13,Spi13}. Since some of these states strongly decay to\nthe negative parity states, it is believed that the quadrupole and octupole degrees of\nfreedom are closely connected to these excitations. In the IBM, such 0\\(^+\\) states have\nbeen interpreted as having a double octupole character \\cite{Lev13,Spi13}. Although this simple\npicture may not be entirely correct, the IBM has been proved to reasonably describe simultaneously\nthe electromagnetic and transfer  properties. In order to reproduce the experimental features,\none has to abandon the description of the nuclei using a simplified Hamiltonian, which is suited\nto describe mainly electromagnetic data. Such calculations were found to completely fail to\nreproduce the (p,t) spectroscopic factors by predicting a transfer strength of 1\\(\\%\\) of that\nof the ground state, while experimentally the summed transfer intensity amounts to about 80\\(\\%\\)\nin this region. The solution seems to be the introduction of the second-order O(5) Casimir\noperator in the Hamiltonian, which allows for a far better description of the complete experimental data.\n\nIn the present work, calculations were performed in the \\(spdf\\) IBM-1 framework using the Extended\nConsistent Q-formalism (ECQF) \\cite{Cas88}. The Hamiltonian employed  in the present paper is:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{H}_{spdf}=\\mathrm{\\epsilon}_{d} \\hat{n}_{d}+\\mathrm{\\epsilon}_{p}\n\\hat{n}_{p}+\\mathrm{\\epsilon}_{f} \\hat{n}_{f} + \\mathrm{\\kappa}(\\hat{Q}_{spdf}\\cdot\n\\hat{Q}_{spdf})^{(0)}\\nonumber\\\\\n + \\mathrm{\\mathit a_{3}}\n[(\\hat{d}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d})^{(3)} \\times (\\hat{d}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d})^{(3)}]^{(0)}\\label{eq1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{d}\\), \\(\\epsilon_{p}\\), and \\(\\epsilon_{f}\\) are the boson energies\nand \\(\\hat{n}_{p}\\), \\(\\hat{n}_{d}\\), and \\(\\hat{n}_{f}\\) are the boson number operators.\nIn the \\(spdf\\) model, the quadrupole operator is considered as being \\cite{Kuz90}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{Q}_{spdf}=\\hat{Q}_{sd}+\\hat{Q}_{pf}=\\nonumber\\\\\n(\\hat{s}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d}+\\hat{d}^{\\dagger}\\hat{s})^{(2)}+\\chi^{(2)}_{sd}(\\hat{d}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d})^{(2)}\n+\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{5}[(p^{\\dagger}\\tilde{f}+f^{\\dagger}\\tilde{p})]^{(2)}\\nonumber\\\\\n+\\chi^{(2)}_{pf} \\left\\{ \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{10}(p^{\\dagger}\\tilde{p})^{(2)}\n+\\frac{3\\sqrt{42}}{10}(f^{\\dagger}\\tilde{f})^{(2)}\\right\\}\\label{eq2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe quadrupole electromagnetic transition operator is:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{T}(E2)=e_{2} \\hat{Q}_{spdf}\\label{eq3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \\(e_{2}\\) represents the boson effective charge.\n\nThe \\(E1\\) transitions are described in the IBM by a linear combination of the three allowed one-body interactions:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{T}(E1)=e_{1}[\\chi_{sp}^{(1)}({s}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{p}+{p}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{s})^{(1)}+({p}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d}\n+{d}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{p})^{(1)}\\nonumber\\\\\n+\\chi_{df}^{(1)}({d}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{f}+{f}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d})^{(1)}]\\label{eq4}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \\(e_{1}\\) is the effective charge for the \\(E1\\) transitions and \\(\\chi_{sp}^{(1)}\\)\nand \\(\\chi_{df}^{(1)}\\) are two model parameters.\n\nAt this point, one has to introduce an additional term in order to describe the connection between\nstates with no (\\(pf\\)) content with those having \\((pf)^2\\)  components. This term is very useful\nto describe both the \\(E2\\) transitions and also the transfer strength between such states.\nTherefore, the same dipole-dipole interaction term is introduced in the present calculations\nas previously used in Refs. \\cite{Eng87,Zam03,Lev13}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{H}_{int}=\\alpha \\hat{D}^{\\dagger}_{spdf}\\cdot \\hat{D}_{spdf}+ H.c.\\label{eq6}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{D}_{spdf}=-2\\sqrt{2}[{p}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d}+{d}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{p}]^{(1)}\n+\\sqrt{5}[{s}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{p}+{p}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{s}]^{(1)}\\\\\\nonumber\n+\\sqrt{7}[{d}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{f}+{f}^{\\dagger}\\tilde{d}]^{(1)}\\label{eq7}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nis the dipole operator arising from the \\(O\\)(4) dynamical symmetry limit, which does not conserve\nseparately the number of positive and negative parity bosons \\cite{Kuz89,Kuz_up}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\n\\epsfig{file=fig9.eps, width=16 cm, angle=0} \\caption{\\label{fig:IBMspe} Energies of all\nexperimentally assigned excited 0\\(^{+}\\), 2\\(^{+}\\), and 4\\(^{+}\\) states in \\(^{232}\\)U in\ncomparison with IBM-\\(spdf\\) calculations. The states containing 2 \\(pf\\) bosons in their\nstructure and assumed to have a double dipole/octupole character are marked with an asterisk.}\n\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe goal of the present paper is to describe simultaneously both the existing electromagnetic\nand the transfer strength data. To achieve this goal, two-neutron transfer intensities between\nthe ground state of the target nucleus and the excited states of the residual nucleus were also\ncalculated. The $L=0$ transfer operator has the following form in the IBM:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{P}^{(0)}_{\\nu}=(\\alpha_{p}\\hat{n}_{p}+\\alpha_{f}\\hat{n}_{f})\\hat{s}+\\nonumber\\\\\n+\\alpha_{\\nu} \\left (\\Omega_{\\nu}-N_{\\nu}-\\frac{N_{\\nu}}{N} \\hat{n}_{d}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\left(\\frac{N_{\\nu}+1}{N+1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\hat{s}\\label{eq5}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \\(\\Omega_{\\nu}\\) is the pair degeneracy of the neutron shell, \\(N_{\\nu}\\) is the number\nof neutron pairs, \\(N\\) is the total number of bosons, and \\(\\alpha_{p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{f}\\),\nand \\(\\alpha_{\\nu}\\) are constant parameters. In this configuration, the $L=0$ transfer operator\ncontains additional terms besides the  leading order term (third term) \\cite{Iach87}, which ensures\na non-vanishing transfer intensity to the states with \\((pf)^2\\) configuration.\n\nThe calculations were performed using the computer code OCTUPOLE \\cite{Kuz_up} by allowing up to\nthree negative parity bosons. The following parameters in the Hamiltonian have been used:\n\\(\\epsilon_{d}\\)=0.27 MeV, \\(\\epsilon_{p}\\)=1.14 MeV, \\(\\epsilon_{f}\\)=0.95 MeV, \\(\\kappa\\)=-13 keV,\nand \\(a_{3}\\)=0.026 MeV, which ensures a good reproduction of the low-energy states.\nThe interaction strength is given by the \\(\\alpha\\) parameter and is chosen to have a very small value,\n\\(\\alpha\\)=0.0005 MeV, similar to Refs. \\cite{Zam01,Zam03}, which has a very small influence on the level energies.\n\nThe most important result of these (p,t) transfer experiments is the fact they reveal a large number of 0\\(^+\\) states, the presence of such states at higher excitation energies being the subject of intensive theoretical investigations. Therefore, we present in Fig. \\ref{fig:IBMspe} the full spectrum of experimental excited 0\\(^+\\) states in comparison with the corresponding calculated values. The IBM predicts the existence of 19 0\\(^+\\) states up to an excitation energy of 3 MeV in comparison with 13 0\\(^+\\) states excited in the experiment in the same energy range. The calculated distribution of 0\\(^+\\) states is very similar to the experimental one up to around 2 MeV. The situation is completely different between 2 and 3 MeV, where a large gap is seen in the experiment up to 2.9 MeV, while the IBM predicts an increased number of states with increasing excitation energy. In the experiment, we can speculate that in this region the 0\\(^+\\) states  carry very small transfer strengths, therefore the sensitivity of our experiment was not sufficient to discriminate between individual states. Most of the calculated excitations in this energy range are having two \\(pf\\) bosons in their structure (states marked with asterisk), therefore being related to the presence of double dipole/octupole structure \\cite{Zam01}. Although it is very interesting that IBM describes both the electromagnetic and transfer data at the same time, this is most likely not the only mechanism providing an increased number of 0\\(^+\\) states and therefore we cannot make a definite conclusion on the nature of these excitations based only on these limited experimental data. To support such a claim, more experimental information is needed and in particular the \\(E1\\) and \\(E3\\) transition probabilities to the negative parity states. In Fig. \\ref{fig:IBMspe}, the 2\\(^{+}\\) and 4\\(^{+}\\) levels revealed in the present experiment are also compared with the predictions of the IBM. The experiment revealed 40 firmly assigned excited 2\\(^{+}\\) states and 26 solid assigned excited 4\\(^{+}\\) states up to 3.2 MeV. In the same energy range, the calculations produced 26 excited 2\\(^{+}\\) states and 26 4\\(^{+}\\) excitations.\n\nSince the octupole degree of freedom plays an important role in this mass region, it is crucial for a model to describe at the same time at least the B(E1) and the B(E1)/B(E2) ratios, if the reduced transition probabilities have not been measured. In the IBM, the \\(E1\\) transitions are calculated with Eq.(\\ref{eq4}), while for the \\(E2\\) transitions using Eq.(\\ref{eq3}). In the present calculations, we have used (\\(\\chi^{(2)}_{sd}\\)=-1.32, \\(\\chi^{(2)}_{pf}\\)=-1) as the quadrupole operator parameters and \\(\\chi_{sp}\\)=\\(\\chi_{df}\\)=-0.77 for the parameters in Eq.(\\ref{eq4}).

All the states belonging to this band are having \\((pf)^2\\) bosons in their structure in the IBM calculations and are supposed to have a double octupole phonon character. The agreement in Table \\ref{BE2/BE1_IBM} between experiment and calculations is remarkably good, giving even more confidence in the structure proposed by the IBM. If other excited 0\\(^+\\) levels decay to the negative parity states, one would need the crucial information about the decay pattern of these levels. This can be achieved by future (p,t\\(\\gamma\\)) and (n,n'\\(\\gamma\\)) experiments and we stress here the necessity of performing such delicate investigations.\n\nThe experimental integrated two-neutron transfer intensities are displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig:transfer} panel (a). In contrast to \\(^{228,230}\\)Th where the spectrum is dominated by a single state with high cross section of about 15-20\\(\\%\\) of that of the ground state, the transfer intensity in \\(^{232}\\)U goes not only to the first excited 0\\(^+\\) state, but also to a group of states around 2 MeV, which carries more than 30\\(\\%\\). In the IBM [Fig. \\ref{fig:transfer} panel(b)], the transfer intensity is also split between the first two excited 0\\(^+\\) states and a group of 0\\(^+\\) excitations around 2 MeV. To better compare the agreement with the experimental data, one has to look also at the summed transfer intensity, which is presented in Fig. \\ref{fig:transfer} panel (c) for both the experimental and the calculated values. The main characteristics of the experimental transfer distribution are reproduced, namely the increased population of two groups of 0\\(^+\\) excitations around 1 and 2 MeV, but IBM fails to give a detailed explanation of the individual states. To perform the IBM calculations, the parameters from Eq.(\\ref{eq5}) were estimated from the fit of the known two-neutron transfer intensities (integrated cross sections) in Table 1.  The values employed in the present paper are \\(\\alpha_{p}\\)=0.51 mb/sr, \\(\\alpha_{f}\\)=-0.45 mb/sr, and \\(\\alpha_{1}\\)=0.013 mb/sr.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=fig10.eps, width=8 cm, angle=0} \\caption{\\label{fig:transfer} (Color online) Comparison between the experimental (both firm and tentatively assigned states are included in the figure) two-neutron transfer intensities [panel (a)] for the 0\\(^{+}\\) states and the IBM predictions [panel (b)].

The ability of the QPM to describe multiple $0^+$ states (energies, $E2$ and $E0$ strengths, two-nucleon spectroscopic factors) was\ndemonstrated for $^{158}$Gd \\cite{LoI04}. In a subseqent paper the QPM was applied to the microscopic structure of $0^+$ states in $^{168}$Er and three actinide nuclei ($^{228}$Th,\n$^{230}$Th and $^{232}$U) \\cite{LoI05}. Single particle basis states up to 5 MeV were generated by a deformed axially-symmetric  Woods-Saxon potential. Two-body potentials were represented by a monopole plus multipole pairing interaction and isoscalar and isovector multipole-multipole interactions. Two-phonon states were calculated for multipolarities $\\lambda = 2 - 5$. These calculations are also used to compare to the present detailed analysis of the experimental data for $^{232}$U. As\nfor the theoretical basis of the calculations, we refer to the publications \\cite{LoI05,Sol92}.\n\nThe (p,t) normalized relative transfer\nspectroscopic strengths in the QPM are expressed as ratios\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{spec-fact}\nS_n(p,t) = \\left[\\frac{\\Gamma_n(p,t)}{\\Gamma_0(p,t)}\\right]^2 \\ ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S_{n}(p,t)=\\left[\\frac{\\Gamma_{n}(p,t)}{\\Gamma_{0}(p,t)}\\right]^{2}\\ ,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msup><mrow><mo>[</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04844.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\phi^{20}_{qq}$ are the backward RPA amplitudes of the first $0^+$ excited state.\nFor the isoscalar quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strength $\\kappa^{(0)}_{20} = 0.554$ keV fm$^{-4}$, that reproduces the experimental energy of the first $0^+$ excited\nstate, the ground-state correlations estimated by $n^{20}_{max}$ become large (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:lowest0+}). As a consequence, the RPA approximation used in the SQPM is no more accurate and multi-phonon admixtures and interactions between phonons have to be taken into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=fig12.eps, width=8.5 cm, angle=0}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:lowest0+} The SQPM energy $E$ (solid line), the normalized relative transfer strength $S_n(p,t)$ (dashed line), the contribution $S^{\\phi}_n(p,t)$ of\nthe backward RPA amplitude $\\phi$ to $S_n(p,t)$ (dotted line) and the maximum number of quasiparticles with quantum number $q$ in the ground state\n$(n^{20})_{max}$ (dashed-dotted line) as\nfunctions of the isoscalar quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strength $\\kappa^{(0)}_{20}$ for the first excited $0^+$ state, $\\kappa^{(1)}_{20} = 0$.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:QPM-BCS} (a) and (b) the experimental spectrum of the $0^{+}$ (p,t) normalized relative transfer strengths is compared to the results of the SQPM and QPM calculations. The numerical results of the QPM calculations from Ref. ~\\cite{LoI05} are provided to us by A.~V.~Sushkov \\cite{Sush15}.\nBoth SQPM and QPM calculations reproduce the strong excitation of the first 0$^+$ excited state in accordance with the experiment. The SQPM generates 9 $0^+$ states below 2 MeV in\nfair agreement with the 10 firmly assigned states and 3 $0^+$ states in the region $2-3$ MeV compared to 2 experimentally assigned states. The QPM fails to reproduce the experimental number of the $0^+$ states. It predicts only 6 $0^+$ states below 2 MeV and 20 $0^+$ states in the region $2-3$ MeV. The difference in the number of the $0^+$ states between the SQPM\nand the QPM is caused mainly by the truncated SQPM model space (two-phonon states not considered).\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:QPM-BCS} (c) we present also the increments of the experimental relative transfer strength in comparison to those of the BCS, SQPM and QPM. Additional interactions\nin the QPM lead to level repulsion (excited $0^+$ states spectrum broadening) and transfer strength fragmentation (lower relative transfer strength for the first excited\n$0^+$ state in favor of higher excited states up to 2 MeV). In the region above 1.8 MeV, both SQPM and QPM fail to reproduce the sharp experimental increase of the (p,t) strength\nrunning sum.\nIn Table~\\ref{QPM_structure}, structure and normalized relative transfer strength of the QPM $0^+$ excited states are\npresented. It is difficult to make an assignment to experimental levels above 1.5 MeV. The second two excited states, $0_3^{+}$ and $0_4^{+}$, most probably correspond to the experimental levels at 1.277 and 1.482 MeV, which is supported by the similar normalized relative transfer strengths. The experimental level at 0.927 MeV with the high B(E1)/B(E2) transition ratios and low normalized relative transfer strength is not reproduced, neither in the SQPM (see Table~\\ref{BE_SQPM}) nor in the QPM \\cite{LoI05}. Contrary to the IBM, two-octupole phonon states are shifted to higher energies $\\sim 2.4 - 2.5$ MeV due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The lower-lying states (e.g. $0_4^{+}$ at 1.45 MeV) possess only small\ntwo-octupole phonon admixtures. On the other hand, for the octupole-octupole isoscalar strength $\\kappa^{(0)}_{30} = 7$ eV fm$^{-6}$, that reproduces the experimental energy of the first $1^-$ excited state, the SQPM predicts enhanced $E1$ transitions from the $K=0^-$ band to the g.s. band, e.g.\n$B(E1;1_1^- \\rightarrow 0_1^+)= 0.2$ e$^2$ fm$^2 = 0.08 $ W.u. As a consequence, even a small admixture of double octupole phonon configuration $[(30)_1(30)_1]$ in $0_3^{+}$\nof about $0.3 - 0.6\\%$ can account for the experimentally observed $B(E1)/B(E2)$ ratios (see Table~\\ref{BE_SQPM}).\n\nThe SQPM and the QPM are quite accurate in nuclei with small ground-state correlations. Since in $^{232}$U the ground-state correlations (as tested for the SQPM) become\nlarge, the effect of multi-phonon admixtures (three and more phonons) in the QPM that pushes two-phonon poles and consequently two-phonon\nenergies to lower values is then underestimated. In future QPM studies one also has to take into account the spin-quadrupole interaction that is known to influence the\ndensity and structure of low-lying $0^+$ states \\cite{Pya67}.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\caption{\\label{QPM_structure} Phonon structure of the QPM $0^+$ states up to 2.6 MeV \\cite{Sush15}.\nThe weights of the one-phonon $(\\lambda\\mu|_i)$ or the two-phonon\n$[(\\lambda\\mu)_i(\\lambda\\mu)_i|]$ components are given in percent.

Local groups of 2$^+$, 4$^+$   and 6$^+$ states  are shifted relative\nto 0$^+$  states in the direction of higher energies.\nThe assumption that the $0^+$ states are localized mainly in a limited region, and that\nthe density of the 0$^+$ levels above 3 MeV is, at least, negligible was made in \\cite{Lev09}.\nWith this purpose, the triton spectra from the $^{232}$Th(p,t)$^{230}$Th reaction\nwere measured for the energy range of 3 $\\div$ 4 MeV, but only for the angles 12.5$^\\circ$ and 26$^\\circ$.\nTwo lines in the spectra meet the condition not only for the 0$^+$ state, but also for 6$^+$ states.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:zero_all}  shows the 0$^+$ state\nspectra  of studied actinides and  as an example one of the rare earth nucleus, $^{154}$Gd.\nIn the rare earth region, spin-parity values 0$^+$ were assigned for many nuclei using\nthe triton angular distributions for only three \\cite{Mey06,Ili10} and even two \\cite{Ber13} angles, exploring\nthe fact that the $L=0$ transfer angular distribution peaks strongly at forward angles.\nAs one could  see, some of the $L=2$ and 4 angular distributions also peak strongly\nat forward angles. Therefore, some tentative assignments of spin 0$^+$ just below 3 MeV\n(as for $^{154}$Gd) not actually belong to the 0$^+$ states. Only a detailed fitting  of\nthe angular distribution in a sufficiently large range of angles would allow to distinguish\nbetween the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ or 4$^+$  assignments.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=fig14.eps, width=7.5 cm, angle=0}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:stat_an} (Color online)\n Normalized\nnearest-neighbor spacing as a function of a dimensionless spacing variable $s$\n and fit with the Brody distribution: (a) experimental data for $^{228,230}$Th, $^{232}$U\n and  $^{240}$Pu in the energy interval of $0 - 3$ MeV, (b)  calculated by\n the QPM data for $^{228,230}$Th, $^{232}$U\n in the energy interval of $0 - 4$ MeV.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt the same time, the IBM and the QPM predict  an increase in the number of 0$^+$ states with\nincreasing energy.

The Brody distribution was used\nfor fitting the normalized\nnearest-neighbor spacing as a function of a dimensionless spacing variable $s$ \\cite{Bro73}.\nIt was applied in \\cite{Mey06} for  analysis of the 0$^+$ spectra in the rare earth\nnuclei  testing for the ordered or chaotic (mixed) nature of these spectra.\nThe Brody distribution  describes systems with intermediate degrees of mixing depending\n on the parameter $q$, which ranges from 0 for a Poisson distribution (ordered nature) to 1 for a Wigner distribution (chaotic nature)\n \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 76747, "prevtext": "\nwhere the amplitude $\\Gamma_n(p,t)$ includes the transitions between the $^{234}$U ground state and one-quadrupole $K=0$ phonon components of the $^{232}$U wave function. The amplitude $\\Gamma_0(p,t)$ refers to the transition between the $^{234}$U and $^{232}$U ground states. The selected normalization assures that $S_0(p,t) = 100$ for the ground state transition.\n\nTo see the role of the two-phonon and pairing-vibrational excitations in the QPM calculations, we performed  simple QPM (SQPM) calculation using the Nilsson potential plus monopole pairing\ninteraction (Nilsson parameters $\\kappa$ and $\\mu$ taken from Ref.~\\cite{Sol76}, deformation\nparameters $\\epsilon_2 =0.192$, $\\epsilon_4=-0.008$ and pairing gaps $\\Delta_p =0.706$ MeV,  $\\Delta_n=0.602$ MeV for $^{232}$U and\n$\\epsilon_2 =0.200$, $\\epsilon_4=-0.073$ and pairing gaps $\\Delta_p =0.738$ MeV, $\\Delta_n=0.582$ MeV for $^{234}$U from\nRefs.~\\cite{Mol95,Mol97}) plus isoscalar and isovector quadrupole-quadrupole and octupole-octupole interactions. Only\none-phonon RPA states were taken into account  in these calculations. Energies of two-quasiparticle $0^+$ states were estimated from the BCS theory.\nThe model predicts 15 neutron two-quasiparticle states of the structure $\\alpha^{\\dag}_q \\alpha^{\\dag}_{\\bar{q}}$ below 4 MeV that correspond to broken neutron pairs\nsensitive to two-neutron transfer. The energies and normalized relative transfer strengths are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:QPM-BCS}(a) for $S_n(p,t) \\ge 0.01$ and compared to the experimental energies and relative transfer strengths. It is evident that the two-quasiparticle $0^+$ states represent only a minor contribution to the total relative transfer strength (cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:QPM-BCS}(c)).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering \\epsfig{file=fig11.eps, width=8 cm, angle=0} \\caption{\n\\label{fig:QPM-BCS}\n(Color online) Comparison of experimental and BCS in panel (a), SQPM and QPM in panel (b) 0$^+$ (p,t) normalized relative  strengths.

It was found that an effect of $\\kappa^{(1)}_{20}$ on the (p,t) spectroscopic strengths is negligible and that\n$\\kappa^{(0)}_{20}$ significantly influences only energy and spectroscopic strength of the first $0^+$ excited state.\nIt is known that in the even-even actinides the phonon coupling does not spoil the coherence of pairing correlations in the lowest $0^+$ excited state \\cite{LoI05}. As a consequence, the state has a pronounced pairing-vibrational character that manifests itself by large RPA backward $\\phi$ amplitudes. From Fig.~\\ref{fig:lowest0+} one can see that the contribution $S^{\\phi}_n$(p,t) of the backward RPA amplitudes to the normalized relative transfer spectroscopic strength $S_n$(p,t) is important for the first excited $0^+$ state, thus indicating its pairing vibrational character. The pairing interaction is essential for reproducing the experimental relative transfer strength of the first excited $0^+$ state. If we artificially lower the neutron and proton pairing interaction strengths and simultaneously change the isoscalar quadrupole-quadrupole interaction to fit the experimental energy of the first excited $0^+$ state both $S^{\\phi}_n$(p,t) and $S_n$(p,t) rapidly drop down. The SQPM predicts $B(E2)= 4$ W.u. for the transition from the first excited $0^+$ state to the $2^+$ member of the g.s. band, the QPM gives a slightly lower value of 2.3 W.u. Therefore, we can assume that the lowest $0^+$ excited state ($0_2^+$) has a mixed pairing-vibrational and $\\beta$-vibrational character. The contribution of $S^{\\phi}_n$(p,t) for higher excited $0^+$ states in the SQPM is significantly lower and in most cases negligible, thus indicating their\nweak phonon-vibrational or two-quasiparticle character. The maximum value of the number of quasiparticles with the quantum number $q$ in\nthe ground state, $n^{20}_{max}$, measures the ground-state correlations and can be calculated from (see \\cite{Web98}):\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nn^{20}_{max} = \\max{\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi^{20}_{qq})^2 \\right] }\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"n^{20}_{max}=\\max{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi^{20}_{qq})^{2}\\right]}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mn>20</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>max</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow><mn>20</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04844.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the parameters $b$  and $A$ are determined  by the value of $q$:\n  $b = [\\Gamma((2+q)/(1+q))]^{q+1}$\nand $A=b(1+q)$. To get the value of  $\\chi^2 $  parameter  $A$  was left free. In such a way,\nthe experimental data for $^{228,230}$Th \\cite{Lev09,Lev13}, $^{232}$U and\n$^{240}$Pu \\cite{Spi13} are fitted by the Brody distribution for $q = 0.6$ (the same as for\nthe rare earth nuclei in \\cite{Mey06})  with $\\chi^2 = 0.011$.  The theoretical data\nfrom \\cite{LoI04,Sush15} can be fitted by the Brody distribution\nfor $q = 0.5$, but only with a worse $\\chi^2 = 0.027$. In both cases, the obtained\nvalues of the parameter $A$ are close to $A=b(1+q)$.\nA much better fit is obtained for the Poisson distribution with $\\chi^2 = 0.012$.\nThis means that the experimental 0$^+$ spectrum in the energy interval $0 - 3$ MeV is\nintermediate between an ordered and chaotic nature, while the ordered nature is   preferred\nfor the theoretical spectrum in the energy interval $0-4$ MeV.\nBesides that  the mean number of 0$^+$ states observed in one nucleus  in the energy range\nof $0-3$ MeV is about 18, while the number of theoretically predicted 0$^+$ states\nin the energy range of $0-4$ MeV is about 80.\nTherefore, it is important to investigate at least the region $3 - 4$ MeV  for the presence\nof additional 0$^+$ excitations.\n\nThe phenomenologic IBM-1 used in the present paper even\nin its simplified two-parametric form is known for its capability to\nstudy chaos and\ntransitions between order and chaos\nin the properties of low-lying collective states of even-even nuclei\n\\cite{Alh90,Cej09}. In the microscopic QPM, an introduction of\nmulti-phonon states\n(three and more) seems to be necessary to move from order towards chaos.\nThis idea is supported by the analysis performed for odd nuclei\n\\cite{Sto04,Sto13},\nwhere the addition\nof one-quasiparticle plus two-phonon states (i.e. $\\rq$5-qp states$\\rq$)\nto the standard one-quasiparticle and one-quasiparticle plus one-phonon\nstates led to a fit\nof the calculated $17/2^+$ $^{209}$Pb spectra to the Brody distribution\nwith the parameter $q=0.6$, thus corresponding to a transitional region\nbetween order and chaos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nTo summarize, in a high-resolution experiment the excited states of $^{232}$U have\nbeen studied in the (p,t) transfer reaction.  162 levels were assigned, using a DWBA fit procedure.\nAmong them, 13 excited $0^+$ states have been found in this nucleus up to\nan energy of 3.2 MeV, most of them have not been experimentally observed before.\nTheir accumulated strength makes up 84\\,\\% of the ground-state strength.\nFirm assignments have been made for most of the 2$^+$, 4$^+$  and for about half of\nthe 6$^+$ states. These assignments allowed to identify the sequences of states,\nwhich have the features of rotational bands with definite inertial parameters.\nMoments of inertia are derived from these sequences.\nMost of the values of the moments of inertia are not much higher than\n the value for the g.s. band. This indicates that they may correspond  mainly\n to a quadrupolar one-phonon structure of 0$^+$ states.\n\nThe experimental data have been compared to {\\it spdf}-IBM and QPM calculations.\nThe IBM reproduces the main characteristics of the experimental transfer distribution,\nnamely the running sum of the (p,t) strengths and increased population of two groups\nof 0\\(^+\\) excitations around 1 and 2 MeV, but the strength of the first excited $0^+$ state is\nunderestimated and the strength of the second $0^+$ state is overestimated.\nMost of the calculated excitations have two \\(pf\\) bosons in their structure,\ntherefore being related to the presence of a double octupole structure.\nGood agreement with experiment for the B(E1)/B(E2) transition ratios indicates also the\nimportance of the octupole degree of freedom.\nThe QPM reproduces the strong (p,t) strength of the first excited $0^+$\nstate due to its predicted pairing vibrational character\nand lower (p,t) strengths for higher-lying $0^+$ states. It fails to\naccount for a rapid increase of the running sum of the (p,t) strength\nabove 1.8 MeV and predicts only minor double-octupole phonon components\nin states below 2.4 MeV.\nBoth models fail to give a detailed explanation of the individual\nstates.\n\nThe comparison of the experimental nearest-neighbor spacing distribution\nof the $0^+$ states in the region of $0-3$ MeV for four actinide\nisotopes\n($^{228,230}$Th, $^{232}$U and $^{240}$Pu) to the Brody distribution\nrevealed an intermediate character of the experimental $0^+$ spectrum\nbetween order and chaos. A similar distribution for the data obtained from the QPM calculations\n in the region of $0-4$ MeV somewhat differs  from the experimental one\n and is closer to the ordered nature.  Though the increased role of\nmulti-phonon states in the model at higher energies means movement\nto chaos. Therefore, (p,t) and (p,t$\\gamma$) experiments for higher\nenergies could provide additional information on the nature\nof $0^+$ excitations.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\n\nThe work was supported by the DFG (C4-Gr894/2-3, Gu179/3, Jo391/2-3, Zl510/4-2);\nby the National Programme for Sustainability I (2013-2020) by the state budget\nof the Czech Republic, identification code: LO1406; by the Romanian Executive\nUnit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation\nunder contracts Crt. 127/F4 and PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0367.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\n\\bibitem{Lev94}   A.~I.~Levon,  J.~de Boer, G.~Graw, R.~Hertenberger,\n    D.~Hofer, J.~Kvasil, A.~L\\\"osch, E.~M\\\"uller-Zanotti, M.~W\\\"urkner, H.~Baltzer,\n    V.~Grafen, and C.~G\\\"unther,  Nucl.

The numerical results of the QPM calculations from Ref. ~\\cite{LoI05} are provided to us by A.~V.~Sushkov \\cite{Sush15}.\nBoth SQPM and QPM calculations reproduce the strong excitation of the first 0$^+$ excited state in accordance with the experiment. The SQPM generates 9 $0^+$ states below 2 MeV in\nfair agreement with the 10 firmly assigned states and 3 $0^+$ states in the region $2-3$ MeV compared to 2 experimentally assigned states. The QPM fails to reproduce the experimental number of the $0^+$ states. It predicts only 6 $0^+$ states below 2 MeV and 20 $0^+$ states in the region $2-3$ MeV. The difference in the number of the $0^+$ states between the SQPM\nand the QPM is caused mainly by the truncated SQPM model space (two-phonon states not considered).\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:QPM-BCS} (c) we present also the increments of the experimental relative transfer strength in comparison to those of the BCS, SQPM and QPM. Additional interactions\nin the QPM lead to level repulsion (excited $0^+$ states spectrum broadening) and transfer strength fragmentation (lower relative transfer strength for the first excited\n$0^+$ state in favor of higher excited states up to 2 MeV). In the region above 1.8 MeV, both SQPM and QPM fail to reproduce the sharp experimental increase of the (p,t) strength\nrunning sum.\nIn Table~\\ref{QPM_structure}, structure and normalized relative transfer strength of the QPM $0^+$ excited states are\npresented. It is difficult to make an assignment to experimental levels above 1.5 MeV. The second two excited states, $0_3^{+}$ and $0_4^{+}$, most probably correspond to the experimental levels at 1.277 and 1.482 MeV, which is supported by the similar normalized relative transfer strengths. The experimental level at 0.927 MeV with the high B(E1)/B(E2) transition ratios and low normalized relative transfer strength is not reproduced, neither in the SQPM (see Table~\\ref{BE_SQPM}) nor in the QPM \\cite{LoI05}. Contrary to the IBM, two-octupole phonon states are shifted to higher energies $\\sim 2.4 - 2.5$ MeV due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The lower-lying states (e.g. $0_4^{+}$ at 1.45 MeV) possess only small\ntwo-octupole phonon admixtures. On the other hand, for the octupole-octupole isoscalar strength $\\kappa^{(0)}_{30} = 7$ eV fm$^{-6}$, that reproduces the experimental energy of the first $1^-$ excited state, the SQPM predicts enhanced $E1$ transitions from the $K=0^-$ band to the g.s. band, e.g.\n$B(E1;1_1^- \\rightarrow 0_1^+)= 0.2$ e$^2$ fm$^2 = 0.08 $ W.u. As a consequence, even a small admixture of double octupole phonon configuration $[(30)_1(30)_1]$ in $0_3^{+}$\nof about $0.3 - 0.6\\%$ can account for the experimentally observed $B(E1)/B(E2)$ ratios (see Table~\\ref{BE_SQPM}).\n\nThe SQPM and the QPM are quite accurate in nuclei with small ground-state correlations. Since in $^{232}$U the ground-state correlations (as tested for the SQPM) become\nlarge, the effect of multi-phonon admixtures (three and more phonons) in the QPM that pushes two-phonon poles and consequently two-phonon\nenergies to lower values is then underestimated.

Local groups of 2$^+$, 4$^+$   and 6$^+$ states  are shifted relative\nto 0$^+$  states in the direction of higher energies.\nThe assumption that the $0^+$ states are localized mainly in a limited region, and that\nthe density of the 0$^+$ levels above 3 MeV is, at least, negligible was made in \\cite{Lev09}.\nWith this purpose, the triton spectra from the $^{232}$Th(p,t)$^{230}$Th reaction\nwere measured for the energy range of 3 $\\div$ 4 MeV, but only for the angles 12.5$^\\circ$ and 26$^\\circ$.\nTwo lines in the spectra meet the condition not only for the 0$^+$ state, but also for 6$^+$ states.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:zero_all}  shows the 0$^+$ state\nspectra  of studied actinides and  as an example one of the rare earth nucleus, $^{154}$Gd.\nIn the rare earth region, spin-parity values 0$^+$ were assigned for many nuclei using\nthe triton angular distributions for only three \\cite{Mey06,Ili10} and even two \\cite{Ber13} angles, exploring\nthe fact that the $L=0$ transfer angular distribution peaks strongly at forward angles.\nAs one could  see, some of the $L=2$ and 4 angular distributions also peak strongly\nat forward angles. Therefore, some tentative assignments of spin 0$^+$ just below 3 MeV\n(as for $^{154}$Gd) not actually belong to the 0$^+$ states. Only a detailed fitting  of\nthe angular distribution in a sufficiently large range of angles would allow to distinguish\nbetween the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ or 4$^+$  assignments.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=fig14.eps, width=7.5 cm, angle=0}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:stat_an} (Color online)\n Normalized\nnearest-neighbor spacing as a function of a dimensionless spacing variable $s$\n and fit with the Brody distribution: (a) experimental data for $^{228,230}$Th, $^{232}$U\n and  $^{240}$Pu in the energy interval of $0 - 3$ MeV, (b)  calculated by\n the QPM data for $^{228,230}$Th, $^{232}$U\n in the energy interval of $0 - 4$ MeV.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt the same time, the IBM and the QPM predict  an increase in the number of 0$^+$ states with\nincreasing energy.  The impact of the inclusion of these additional levels can be seen\nfrom the statistical analysis of the level density  for actinides, experimental in\nthe energy interval of $0 - 3$ MeV and predicted by the QPM  in the energy interval of\n$0 - 4$ MeV (Fig.~\\ref{fig:stat_an}). The Brody distribution was used\nfor fitting the normalized\nnearest-neighbor spacing as a function of a dimensionless spacing variable $s$ \\cite{Bro73}.\nIt was applied in \\cite{Mey06} for  analysis of the 0$^+$ spectra in the rare earth\nnuclei  testing for the ordered or chaotic (mixed) nature of these spectra.\nThe Brody distribution  describes systems with intermediate degrees of mixing depending\n on the parameter $q$, which ranges from 0 for a Poisson distribution (ordered nature) to 1 for a Wigner distribution (chaotic nature)\n \n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:Brody}\nN_{eff} = A s^q \\exp{(-bs^{q+1})} \\ ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N_{eff}=As^{q}\\exp{(-bs^{q+1})}\\ ,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mi>q</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"7.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
