In particular, cold streams\nare more useful than hot streams for constraining the shape of the Milky Way's halo \n\\citep[see][and references therein]{lux2013}. Also, because of their low velocity dispersion,\ncold streams exhibit density variations, or ``gaps'', that are caused by dark matter subhalos\n\\citep{yoon11, carlberg12, pal5gaps, carlberg13, gd1, NC14, N14, erkal2015}.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany theoretical studies of tidal streams rely on idealized profiles, such as logarithmic\nor Navarro-Frenk-White profiles \\citep{nfw}, as the dark matter halo potentials of the host galaxies. Although\nidealized profiles have analytic forms and are simple to compute, {they result from spherical averaging\nof many simulations of dark matter halos \\citep{nfw, navarro04,navarro10}, and the averaging} does not capture the realistic\ndetails inside the\nindividual potentials. Furthermore, both theoretical \\citep{dc91, js02, zemp2009} and observational\n{}{\\citep{law09,lm2010,dw2013,vh2013}} efforts concluded that Milky Way's\ndark matter halo is not spherical but triaxial. Some studies model the shapes of halos by \nintroducing triaxial parameters into the radial coordinate of the idealized profiles \n\\citep[e.g.,][]{lm2010}. In this study, however, we take an even more general approach\n{}{to simulate tidal streams directly in the potential of Via Lactea II (VL-2), a high-resolution\ndark matter halo simulation in the {$\\Lambda$CDM}\\ cosmological context \\citep{diemand08},} without\n{}{fitting the halo} to any idealized profiles.\n\n{}{Tidal stream simulations in the VL-2 potential was first done by \\citet{bonaca2014}, where they gave VL-2\nits original N-body treatment, but generated tidal streams using the Streakline method \\citep{streakline}.}\nIn \\citet{N14} we took a different approach, where we constructed a potential model using one snapshot of VL-2,\nbut treated the tidal streams as N-body problems.\nThe self-consistent field method \\citep{scf} allowed us to construct accurate potential\nmodels {}{that} are optimized for dark matter halos. We furthermore isolated the subhalos found\nin the VL-2 halo, so we were able to construct two models: a ``smooth'' VL-2 halo with no\nsubhalos, and a ``lumpy'' VL-2 halo with the subhalos originally found. These two models can be\nused to study the effects of subhalos on tidal streams {}{in order to} shed light\non the ``missing satellites problem'' {}{\\citep{klypin99, moore99, yoon11, NC14, N14}},\n{}{and we continue to use our models for this study.}\n\n\nRecently, \\citet{bonaca2014,N14,pearson2014,fardal15} showed that streams inside {}{non-spherical} potentials\nexhibit fluffy features {}{dubbed ``stream-fanning''} which are not found\nin streams inside spherical potentials. {}{This effect has been invoked by \\citet{sesar16} to explain\nthe puzzling orbit and length of the recently observed Ophiuchus stream \\citep{bernard2014,sesar2015}.}\n{}{This suggests that spherical potentials are no longer suitable for modeling tidal streams.\nIt is important to note that while stream-fanning implies a non-spherical potential, the converse is not true;\nnot all streams inside non-spherical potentials exhibit stream-fanning.} The results of our study here, as we will {quantify},\nindicate that while streams inside a realistic potential\nare {in general wider and more diffuse} than streams inside a spherical halo,\n{}{thin streams can still exist even under the influence of a realistic halo and subhalos.}\n\nThe goal of this study is to investigate how dispersed tidal streams are in a realistic halo, and\n{}{whether we should be optimistic that large stellar surveys in the near future will be able to\nuncover more cold and thin streams similar to Pal-5 \\citep{odenkirchen01} or GD-1 \\citep{grillmair2006}.}\nWe simulate a total of 300 tidal streams as {self-gravitating} N-body simulations\nof the same globular star cluster orbiting inside {}{the following \ncases of host halos}: (a) {a} spherical halo with no subhalos, (b) {a} spherical halo with subhalos,\n(c) {the} VL-2 halo with no subhalos, and (d) {the} VL-2 halo with subhalos. In all cases, the host's and subhalos'\npotentials are not evolving in time, although subhalos orbit around the host's potential as test masses.\n{}{\\citet{bonaca2014} fitted the VL-2's potential at different times to triaxial idealized profiles while allowing each \nparameter to vary radially, and they found that each parameter changed by no more than $\\lesssim10\\%$ over the \nlast 6 Gyr. Using} a time dependent potential, {}{especially at the early stages of the halos' formation,}\nis an important step in the future, but we believe that the effects of a realistic potential itself\nis worth studying before including the additional complication of time dependence.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows.

The subhalos of the host halos are identified and\nextracted from the zero redshift snapshot of VL-2\n{}{using the {\\sc Amiga Halo Finder\\footnote{\n\\url{http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF/Download.html}}}. Inside the main halo of VL-2, {we consider only\nthe subhalos which are the immediate satellites of the main halo, such that all the satellites\nof a given subhalo (including all the hierarchically smaller satellites) are all considered as\npart of that subhalo.}}\n\nFor each subhalo, the halo finder returns the positions and velocities\nwhich are used to initialize the subhalo's orbit around the main halo, as well as masses and scale radii which are\nused to construct the subhalo's potential using the SCF method {}{as described above, but} with $n_{max}=4$\nand $l_{max}=0$. To ensure a fair comparison,\nall the subhalos in both the VL-2 and spherical host halos are modeled identically{}{, and their\norbits are initialized identically as well}. \nThe subhalos are assumed not to interact with each other and orbit the host halos as test masses,\n{and they} use the positions and velocities {}{at redshift zero of VL-2} as orbital initial conditions.\n\nWe identify 11,523 subhalos in total {}{whose masses range from $1.2{\\times10^{{6}}}{M_\\odot}$ to $4.7{\\times10^{{9}}}{M_\\odot}$} \nin the main halo in the zero redshift snapshot of VL-2. This is consistent with the abundance reported by \n\\citet{diemand08}. In each lumpy case, we further consider two sub-cases with two different\nmass ranges $M_{sub}$ of subhalos: (i) all subhalos with $M_{sub}>10^7{M_\\odot}$ and (ii) all subhalos with\n$M_{sub}>5{\\times10^{{6}}}{M_\\odot}$. Our halo finder reports totals of 1087 and 2007 subhalos for the two mass ranges,\nrespectively. {}{These lower limits in our mass ranges are chosen such that their contributions to the dispersal\nof tidal debris become significant. As we show in our results later, expanding the range of\nsubhalos from (i) to (ii) has a negligible effect on tidal debris; meanwhile, \\citet{NC14} showed that the inclusion of \n$M_{sub}<10^8{M_\\odot}$ subhalos can open up large gaps, which may significantly affect the distribution of\ndebris along the stream.} As opposed to \\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14}, here we do not impose an upper limit for subhalo masses\nbecause our goal is to investigate the {}{global} perturbations on tidal streams {}{where\nmany stars in the stream are affected (ie. how dispersed the debris is), {}{rather than local perturbations\nwhich only affect small parts (ie. gaps) of the stream.}\nNote that this means the subhalo with the highest mass in this study is more massive than those in\n\\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14} which were limited to $M_{sub}<10^8{M_\\odot}$}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to \\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14}, in our actual simulations we do not include the subhalos\nwhich interact minimally with the streams, as some subhalos have pericentric distances {that} are\ngreater than the streams' apocentric distances. As explained below, our stream orbits are restricted\nto a maximum apocentric distance of 30 kpc. Therefore, subhalos with pericentric distances greater than 40 kpc can be\nsafely eliminated. For the mass ranges of subhalos mentioned above, only 381 and 674 subhalos, respectively, remain for\nthe VL-2 potential, and {}{306} and {}{547} subhalos, respectively, remain for the spherical potential.\n{}{The subhalos in both the VL-2 and spherical halos spend medians of $\\sim0.4$ Gyr in total (out of 10 Gyr which is \nthe duration of each stream simulation) in the inner 40 kpc of their respective halos.\nSince we include more subhalos in the VL-2 halo than in the spherical halo, subhalos are more\nlikely to impact our streams in the former case. However, this does not affect our conclusions at the end.}\n\nBecause the lumpy halos are essentially the smooth halos with extra subhalos, lumpy halos are more massive\nthan smooth halos. In the VL-2 halo, 381 and 674 subhalos are about\n1.6\\% and 1.7\\% of the mass of the smooth halo {}{enclosed in its Virial radius 400 kpc}.\nIn the spherical halo, 306 and 547\nsubhalos are about 1.2\\% and 1.3\\% of the {}{total} mass of the smooth halo {}{truncated at 400 kpc}. \nIn \\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14}, stream progenitors with the same initial conditions travel in roughly\nthe same orbit in both smooth and\nlumpy halos because each subhalo's mass is low enough that each subhalo individually does not affect\nthe streams' orbits much. In this study, however, stream progenitors travel in very different orbits\nin smooth and lumpy potentials because most of the subhalo masses are concentrated in the most massive\nsubhalos, which can affect the streams' orbits. {As shown in \\citet{yoon11}, the characteristic energy\nthat a $\\sim10^9{M_\\odot}$ subhalo deposits into a stream is $\\sim10^4\\, \\mathrm{km}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$,\nand this corresponds to the orbital energy $E\\propto v_{orbit}^2 \\sim (200\\, \\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1})^2$\nof a GD-1-like stream whose orbit oscillates radially between $15-30$ kpc.\nTherefore, subhalos more massive than $\\sim10^9{M_\\odot}$ can significantly affect the orbit of the\nstream progenitor, hence the entire stream itself.} This is the reason the smooth and lumpy halos cannot\nbe compared directly using {}{individual} streams in each case when simulations include high mass subhalos. Smooth and\nlumpy halos can only be compared by the statistics of {}{ensembles of} streams as we discuss in our results in\nSection \\ref{sec:results}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Stream Progenitor and Orbits}\n\\label{sec:method_progenitor}\n\n\n\nThe progenitor for all streams in this study is {}{the same} {self-gravitating N-body}\nstar cluster {}{of $N=50000$ particles} following a King profile with $w=2$, where $w$ is the ratio\nbetween the central potential\nand velocity dispersion of the cluster. We initialize the cluster with core radius $r_0=0.05$ kpc\nand mass $m=5{\\times10^{{4}}}{M_\\odot}$, and this yields a cluster with tidal radius $\\sim0.15$ kpc\n(beyond which the density is zero) and velocity dispersion $\\sim1$ {km\\,s$^{-1}$}. {}{This star cluster\nis typically dissolved in a few gigayears and produces a thin stream similar to GD-1 in our\norbits described below.}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe random orbits in our simulations are selected as follows.

The top panels of the each figure show that the\n{dynamical symmetry} of the smooth halo plays an important role in affecting the {dispersal} of the tidal debris. \n{A spherical potential has four isolating integrals of motion---energy and three components of angular momentum---which\nconstrain the phase space of the stream particles into only two dimensions\n({}{for parts of the stream that are} far away from the progenitor). On the contrary, the lack of symmetry,\nhence the {reduced number of} integrals of motion, in the VL-2 halo allows the stream particles to explore\nthe phase space with {fewer} constraints than when the potential is spherical. This is\nwhy the stream particles in the VL-2 halo can have a wider variety of orbits, and the streams are\nmore diffuse than in a spherical halo.}\n\nComparing the top and bottom panels in each of {{Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}} show \nthat subhalos do not disperse streams as much as the lack of dynamical {symmetries} of the\nunderlying halos do. This finding is similar to the conclusion from \\citet{SG08} which simulated \nthe disruption of satellite galaxies that were much more massive and orbited at larger galactocentric\nradii (ie. larger $s$ from Equation \\ref{eqn:tidal_scale}) than our streams. In this\nstudy we simulate the disruptions of a low mass globular cluster orbiting at smaller galactocentric radii, \nwhich result in streams that can be $\\lesssim1{^\\circ}$ wide as seen from the galactic center.\n\n{}{The right panels of {Figure \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}} show another interesting result. Even though the streams in the VL-2 halos\nare more diffuse than in the spherical halos, many of these streams remain very thin\nin the VL-2 halos. This is true even in the presence of subhalos which serve as time-dependent fluctuations\nfor the streams. Therefore, thin globular cluster streams on moderately eccentric orbits (up to $e\\leq0.5$)\nare reasonably robust against the lack of \ndynamical symmetry in the halo, and stellar surveys in the future will likely uncover more thin streams if they exist.\n}\n\n{}{{Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}} shows the progress over the past decade or so in \nsimulating the influence that CDM subhalos have on globular cluster streams. Pioneering studies such as\n\\citet{ibata2002} and \\citet{yoon11} simulated streams inside spherical halos (though the former included\na disk) in order to investigate how subhalos heat up and create gaps in streams, respectively.\nIn addition to subsequent studies such as \\citet{carlberg12, carlberg13, NC14, erkal2015} which\nuse spherical halos, the streams in the above studies would be analogous to the ones shown in \n{Figure \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}}} here.

Their results would be analogous to the streams shown in {Figure \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}. It is also worth\nmentioning that \\citet{johnston2002, mayer2002, SG08} also simulated streams with and without subhalos,\nin a variety of profiles and shapes for the halo potential, but their streams were meant to be debris\nfrom dwarf galaxies and were much wider than the streams shown in {Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{{Dispersal} of Tidal Debris}\n\\label{sec:dispersion_of_tidal_debris}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=7in]{figs/counts/errors.pdf}\n\t\\caption{{}{Cumulative fractions of the streams as functions of cell occupancy ($\\eta$) in the VL-2 and the spherical\n\tNFW halos.

If a stream remains narrow\nwithout much {dispersal}, the occupancy of the grid would be dominated by a few densely occupied cells.\nOn the contrary, if a stream is very dispersed, then the occupancy of the grid would be spread among\nmany sparsely occupied cells.\n\n\n\n\n{Figure \\ref{fig:{count_errors}}} shows the medians and the spreads of the cumulative distributions of cell occupancies\nof 50 streams in each of our halo potentials.

The subhalos of the host halos are identified and\nextracted from the zero redshift snapshot of VL-2\n{}{using the {\\sc Amiga Halo Finder\\footnote{\n\\url{http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF/Download.html}}}. Inside the main halo of VL-2, {we consider only\nthe subhalos which are the immediate satellites of the main halo, such that all the satellites\nof a given subhalo (including all the hierarchically smaller satellites) are all considered as\npart of that subhalo.}}\n\nFor each subhalo, the halo finder returns the positions and velocities\nwhich are used to initialize the subhalo's orbit around the main halo, as well as masses and scale radii which are\nused to construct the subhalo's potential using the SCF method {}{as described above, but} with $n_{max}=4$\nand $l_{max}=0$. To ensure a fair comparison,\nall the subhalos in both the VL-2 and spherical host halos are modeled identically{}{, and their\norbits are initialized identically as well}. \nThe subhalos are assumed not to interact with each other and orbit the host halos as test masses,\n{and they} use the positions and velocities {}{at redshift zero of VL-2} as orbital initial conditions.\n\nWe identify 11,523 subhalos in total {}{whose masses range from $1.2{\\times10^{{6}}}{M_\\odot}$ to $4.7{\\times10^{{9}}}{M_\\odot}$} \nin the main halo in the zero redshift snapshot of VL-2. This is consistent with the abundance reported by \n\\citet{diemand08}. In each lumpy case, we further consider two sub-cases with two different\nmass ranges $M_{sub}$ of subhalos: (i) all subhalos with $M_{sub}>10^7{M_\\odot}$ and (ii) all subhalos with\n$M_{sub}>5{\\times10^{{6}}}{M_\\odot}$. Our halo finder reports totals of 1087 and 2007 subhalos for the two mass ranges,\nrespectively. {}{These lower limits in our mass ranges are chosen such that their contributions to the dispersal\nof tidal debris become significant. As we show in our results later, expanding the range of\nsubhalos from (i) to (ii) has a negligible effect on tidal debris; meanwhile, \\citet{NC14} showed that the inclusion of \n$M_{sub}<10^8{M_\\odot}$ subhalos can open up large gaps, which may significantly affect the distribution of\ndebris along the stream.} As opposed to \\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14}, here we do not impose an upper limit for subhalo masses\nbecause our goal is to investigate the {}{global} perturbations on tidal streams {}{where\nmany stars in the stream are affected (ie. how dispersed the debris is), {}{rather than local perturbations\nwhich only affect small parts (ie. gaps) of the stream.}\nNote that this means the subhalo with the highest mass in this study is more massive than those in\n\\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14} which were limited to $M_{sub}<10^8{M_\\odot}$}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to \\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14}, in our actual simulations we do not include the subhalos\nwhich interact minimally with the streams, as some subhalos have pericentric distances {that} are\ngreater than the streams' apocentric distances. As explained below, our stream orbits are restricted\nto a maximum apocentric distance of 30 kpc. Therefore, subhalos with pericentric distances greater than 40 kpc can be\nsafely eliminated. For the mass ranges of subhalos mentioned above, only 381 and 674 subhalos, respectively, remain for\nthe VL-2 potential, and {}{306} and {}{547} subhalos, respectively, remain for the spherical potential.\n{}{The subhalos in both the VL-2 and spherical halos spend medians of $\\sim0.4$ Gyr in total (out of 10 Gyr which is \nthe duration of each stream simulation) in the inner 40 kpc of their respective halos.\nSince we include more subhalos in the VL-2 halo than in the spherical halo, subhalos are more\nlikely to impact our streams in the former case. However, this does not affect our conclusions at the end.}\n\nBecause the lumpy halos are essentially the smooth halos with extra subhalos, lumpy halos are more massive\nthan smooth halos. In the VL-2 halo, 381 and 674 subhalos are about\n1.6\\% and 1.7\\% of the mass of the smooth halo {}{enclosed in its Virial radius 400 kpc}.\nIn the spherical halo, 306 and 547\nsubhalos are about 1.2\\% and 1.3\\% of the {}{total} mass of the smooth halo {}{truncated at 400 kpc}. \nIn \\citet{NC14} and \\citet{N14}, stream progenitors with the same initial conditions travel in roughly\nthe same orbit in both smooth and\nlumpy halos because each subhalo's mass is low enough that each subhalo individually does not affect\nthe streams' orbits much. In this study, however, stream progenitors travel in very different orbits\nin smooth and lumpy potentials because most of the subhalo masses are concentrated in the most massive\nsubhalos, which can affect the streams' orbits. {As shown in \\citet{yoon11}, the characteristic energy\nthat a $\\sim10^9{M_\\odot}$ subhalo deposits into a stream is $\\sim10^4\\, \\mathrm{km}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$,\nand this corresponds to the orbital energy $E\\propto v_{orbit}^2 \\sim (200\\, \\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1})^2$\nof a GD-1-like stream whose orbit oscillates radially between $15-30$ kpc.\nTherefore, subhalos more massive than $\\sim10^9{M_\\odot}$ can significantly affect the orbit of the\nstream progenitor, hence the entire stream itself.} This is the reason the smooth and lumpy halos cannot\nbe compared directly using {}{individual} streams in each case when simulations include high mass subhalos. Smooth and\nlumpy halos can only be compared by the statistics of {}{ensembles of} streams as we discuss in our results in\nSection \\ref{sec:results}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Stream Progenitor and Orbits}\n\\label{sec:method_progenitor}\n\n\n\nThe progenitor for all streams in this study is {}{the same} {self-gravitating N-body}\nstar cluster {}{of $N=50000$ particles} following a King profile with $w=2$, where $w$ is the ratio\nbetween the central potential\nand velocity dispersion of the cluster. We initialize the cluster with core radius $r_0=0.05$ kpc\nand mass $m=5{\\times10^{{4}}}{M_\\odot}$, and this yields a cluster with tidal radius $\\sim0.15$ kpc\n(beyond which the density is zero) and velocity dispersion $\\sim1$ {km\\,s$^{-1}$}. {}{This star cluster\nis typically dissolved in a few gigayears and produces a thin stream similar to GD-1 in our\norbits described below.}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe random orbits in our simulations are selected as follows.

As\ndiscussed above, this can be attributed to the wider variety of orbits that the VL-2 halo permits due to its\nlack of dynamical symmetry. In particular, extremely ``fluffy'' streams can be found in {Figure \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}} and \nhave been investigated in more detail by \\citet{N14,pearson2014,pricewhelan2016}.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Effects of subhalos}\n\\label{sec:effects_of_subhalos}\n\n{}{The tools developed in the previous section allow us to quantify how subhalos disperse tidal debris, which\nis difficult to see by eye in {Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}. The effects of subhalos are shown in the left and middle\ncolumns of {Figure \\ref{fig:{count_errors}}}. First of all, those two columns have negligible differences.\nThis means that subhalos with masses below $10^7{M_\\odot}$ do not contribute\nsignificantly to dispersing tidal debris. Indeed, versions of {Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}} with $M_{sub}>5{\\times10^{{6}}}{M_\\odot}$\n(not shown here) look almost identical to {Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}} with $M_{sub}>10^7{M_\\odot}$.\nFor the rest of our results, the ``lumpy halo'' refers to the case of a halo with the subhalo mass range $M_{sub}>10^7{M_\\odot}$.\n}\n\n{}{Nevertheless, subhalos of masses $M_{sub}<10^7{M_\\odot}$ do inject enough energy to disperse tidal debris and produce\ngaps in tidal streams. However, as shown in \\citet{yoon11}, the change in energy of the debris decrease rapidly with \ndistance from the impact, and the rate of this decrease depends on the subhalo's mass. More massive subhalos can inject\nenergy at parts of the stream farther away from the impact, whereas less massive subhalos can only do so locally. In other words,\nthe ``gaps'' produced by $M_{sub}>10^7{M_\\odot}$ subhalos are big enough that they may affect large parts of the streams. Our results\nhere focus on the effects of these massive subhalos.\n}\n\n{}{A surprising feature can be seen when we compare streams in the smooth and the lumpy halos of the same halo type\n(ie. same colors between middle and right columns of {Figure \\ref{fig:{count_errors}}}).\nIntuitively, one may think that subhalos can scatter stars away from a stream's\npath, and this would decrease the $\\eta$ of the stream. However, upon closer inspection of {Figure \\ref{fig:{count_errors}}},\nsome streams in lumpy halos can behave in the opposite manner. At the diffuse end, $F(\\eta)$ for the streams in \nlumpy halos are no lower than those in smooth halos. At the dense end, $F(\\eta)$ for the streams in lumpy halos\nare consistently much higher than those in smooth halos. Therefore, while the reduction of dynamical symmetry in\nthe halo can make streams more diffuse, the lumpiness of the halo can make certain parts of streams denser.\nIn the next section, we investigate how the densities in these streams are enhanced.\n}\n\n{}{Density enhancements due to the lumpiness of the halo has important implication for stellar surveys in\nthe near future. The streams that are denser have higher surface brightness, so they may be more easily\nfound in surveys. This means that if the {$\\Lambda$CDM}\\ prediction of the lumpiness of the Milky Way's halo\nis true, then globular cluster streams should be easier to detect. This is a very encouraging result because the detailed\nstructures along these streams, in turn, contain crucial information about the {$\\Lambda$CDM}\\ prediction itself\n(see references in Section \\ref{sec:introduction}).\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The Densest Streams {in the VL-2 Halos}}\n\\label{sec:the_densest_streams_in_the_vl2_halos}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=2.3in]{figs/dense_streams/stream_sims_VLII_0_18.pdf}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=2.3in]{figs/dense_streams/stream_sims_VLII_0_15.pdf}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=2.3in]{figs/dense_streams/stream_sims_VLII_1e7_6.pdf}\\\\\n\t\\includegraphics[width=2.3in]{figs/dense_streams/stream_sims_VLII_1e7_10.pdf} \n\t\\includegraphics[width=2.3in]{figs/dense_streams/stream_sims_VLII_1e7_27.pdf}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=2.3in]{figs/dense_streams/stream_sims_VLII_1e7_32.pdf}\\\\\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=5in]{figs/dense_streams/colorbar.pdf}\n\t\\caption{Six of the densest streams at 9 Gyr in the VL-2 halo.

This stream is not being considered for the rest of this section). We follow our analysis in the previous section where\nwe assign the particles of each stream into a 3D grid with cell size of 0.1 kpc on each side.

Density variation in one stream in the VL-2 halo has previously been\nreported in \\citet{N14} but with a different subhalo mass range. Our study here shows that even in \nthe presence of subhalos more massive than those ($10^8{M_\\odot}$) included in \\citet{N14}, many streams remain thin\nfor a Hubble time.\n}\n\n{}{The densest point of all the streams shown in {Figure \\ref{fig:{dense_streams}}} is the clump at the lower tip of Stream E, whose\n$\\eta$ distribution is shown as the light blue line in {Figure \\ref{fig:{dense_streams_plot}}}. That clump originated from a\ndirect impact by a subhalo with mass $M_{sub}=1.0{\\times10^{{8}}}{M_\\odot}$ and scale radius $r_s=0.8$ kpc at $\\sim6.4$ Gyr.\nThe part of the stream which sustained the impact\nwas moving at $v_{stream}\\simeq(107, -10, -120)$ {km\\,s$^{-1}$}, and the subhalo was moving at $v_{sub}\\simeq(143,378,-88)$ {km\\,s$^{-1}$}.\nShortly after the impact at 6.46 Gyr (upper left panel of {Figure \\ref{fig:{stream_E}}}), a density minimum can be seen at the point\nof impact in between two density peaks. This is consistent with the matched filter profiles used in\n\\citet{carlberg12} and \\citet{NC14} to look for gaps. The stream particles at the point of impact sustained changes\nof energy of $\\sim200\\,\\mathrm{km}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, which agrees with the analytical estimate shown in\nFigure 4 in \\citet{yoon11}. At later times (upper right and lower left panels) the impact causes a shift in the \nstream particles' orbits, and the stream develops a ``z-fold'' which was seen in the idealized simulations in\n\\citet{carlberg09}. As the fold evolves with the stream, both tips of the fold can overlap and occupy the same grid cells.\nThis is seen in the lower right panel where the fold evolved into a clump by 8 Gyr, or 1.6 Gyr after the impact.\nThis is the reason that the typical $\\eta_{max}$ for streams in the lumpy halo is $\\sim2$ times higher than in the smooth halo.\n}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{figs/dense_streams/stream27.pdf}\n\t\\caption{{}{Time evolution of Stream E in {Figure \\ref{fig:{dense_streams}}}.

We found that the lack of {dynamical symmetry} of\nthe smooth halo {}{can disperse} tidal debris more than subhalos do, similar to the conclusion\nof \\citet{SG08} which simulated the tidal disruptions of dwarf galaxies in larger orbits. {}{On the other hand,}\nwe found that subhalos with $M_{sub}>10^7{M_\\odot}$ can make some streams much denser, hence \nmore easily detectable, by bunching up stream stars into clumps which were denser than streams in the \nsmooth halo. Meanwhile, subhalos with $M_{sub}>5{\\times10^{{6}}}{M_\\odot}$ produced almost the same distribution\nof cell occupancies as the $M_{sub}>10^7{M_\\odot}$ case. Therefore, {}{even though subhalos with masses\nbelow $10^7{M_\\odot}$ can produce gaps in streams as shown in previous studies, these subhalos are not important\nfor globally redistributing the material in a stream.}\n\nWe selected a few streams which produced the highest cell occupancies{}{---hence, most easily detectable---}in\nthe VL-2 halo in order to study their morphologies.\nIn the smooth halo, these dense streams are long and $\\lesssim1{^\\circ}$ thin as seen from\nthe galactic center. This suggests that even though a realistic halo disperses tidal debris, long and thin streams\ncan still survive for a Hubble time. In the lumpy halo, the streams with the highest cell occupancies were\njust as long and thin as those in the smooth halo; however, the densest parts of the streams \nwere primarily due to subhalo perturbations which caused stream particles to bunch up. This increased the occupancies\nof the cells near the point where the bunch up occurred. Combined with the effect of longitudinal compression\nat the streams' apocentric passages, streams in a lumpy halo can be much denser than those in a smooth halo.}\n\n{}{To put our results into context, the streams in our study were similar to (but not physical models of)\nglobular streams such as Pal-5 and GD-1. These streams have been well modeled and studied, and are excellent\nsources of knowledge about the dark matter halo in our own galaxy. It would be very useful if more streams\nsimilar to them are detected in the future, should they exist. The question we sought to answer was whether the\nlack of dynamical symmetry of the halo potential or the lumpiness of the halo would erase these streams,\nthus discouraging us from searching for more. As summarized in {Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}} and \\ref{fig:{dense_streams}}}, our conclusion is\nthat even though streams inside realistic cases are more dispersed, many of them can survive as long and thin\nstructures over a Hubble time. In fact, the presence of subhalos may even make some streams easier to detect.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile our N-body streams {are} orbiting realistic halo potentials, our simulations are still missing\na few effects. In addition to a dark matter halo, the Milky Way also has a baryonic galaxy {}{which was not\nincluded in our study. Previous studies such as \\citet{dehnen04} and \\citet{brooks14} (and references therein)\nfound that the galactic disk can influence the mass loss rates of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies, respectively.\nHowever, the effect of a galactic disk on the dispersal of tidal debris has yet to be studied in detail.} Furthermore,\nother than the subhalos' orbits, all our potentials are static since we constructed them using only the\nredshift zero snapshot. In the hierarchical structure formation model, satellite systems are continuously accreted and\nmerged into the main halo. Therefore, we expect both the main halo and the subhalos to be evolving in time.\nFinally, we selected our stream orbits randomly in both\npositions and velocities, which likely resulted in an unrealistic distribution of orbits. \nCurrent surveys such as Gaia \\citep{perryman2001} will be very valuable in providing detailed information of kinematics of globular clusters\nand streams in the Milky Way for future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors thank the referee for a very detailed and constructive review.\nR.W., A.S., and B.B.

On the contrary, the lack of symmetry,\nhence the {reduced number of} integrals of motion, in the VL-2 halo allows the stream particles to explore\nthe phase space with {fewer} constraints than when the potential is spherical. This is\nwhy the stream particles in the VL-2 halo can have a wider variety of orbits, and the streams are\nmore diffuse than in a spherical halo.}\n\nComparing the top and bottom panels in each of {{Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}} show \nthat subhalos do not disperse streams as much as the lack of dynamical {symmetries} of the\nunderlying halos do. This finding is similar to the conclusion from \\citet{SG08} which simulated \nthe disruption of satellite galaxies that were much more massive and orbited at larger galactocentric\nradii (ie. larger $s$ from Equation \\ref{eqn:tidal_scale}) than our streams. In this\nstudy we simulate the disruptions of a low mass globular cluster orbiting at smaller galactocentric radii, \nwhich result in streams that can be $\\lesssim1{^\\circ}$ wide as seen from the galactic center.\n\n{}{The right panels of {Figure \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}} show another interesting result. Even though the streams in the VL-2 halos\nare more diffuse than in the spherical halos, many of these streams remain very thin\nin the VL-2 halos. This is true even in the presence of subhalos which serve as time-dependent fluctuations\nfor the streams. Therefore, thin globular cluster streams on moderately eccentric orbits (up to $e\\leq0.5$)\nare reasonably robust against the lack of \ndynamical symmetry in the halo, and stellar surveys in the future will likely uncover more thin streams if they exist.\n}\n\n{}{{Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}} shows the progress over the past decade or so in \nsimulating the influence that CDM subhalos have on globular cluster streams. Pioneering studies such as\n\\citet{ibata2002} and \\citet{yoon11} simulated streams inside spherical halos (though the former included\na disk) in order to investigate how subhalos heat up and create gaps in streams, respectively.\nIn addition to subsequent studies such as \\citet{carlberg12, carlberg13, NC14, erkal2015} which\nuse spherical halos, the streams in the above studies would be analogous to the ones shown in \n{Figure \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}}} here. In \\citet{ibata2002} they also used a flattened but still idealized potential, and the\nresulting streams would be an intermediate between {Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}.\nIt was only recently when \\citet{bonaca2014} and \\citet{N14} simulated streams inside\nthe potential of the high-resolution halo of VL-2 directly, without fitting the potential to any idealized\nprofiles. Their results would be analogous to the streams shown in {Figure \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}. It is also worth\nmentioning that \\citet{johnston2002, mayer2002, SG08} also simulated streams with and without subhalos,\nin a variety of profiles and shapes for the halo potential, but their streams were meant to be debris\nfrom dwarf galaxies and were much wider than the streams shown in {Figures \\ref{fig:{sky_NFW}} and \\ref{fig:{sky_VLII}}}.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{{Dispersal} of Tidal Debris}\n\\label{sec:dispersion_of_tidal_debris}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=7in]{figs/counts/errors.pdf}\n\t\\caption{{}{Cumulative fractions of the streams as functions of cell occupancy ($\\eta$) in the VL-2 and the spherical\n\tNFW halos.

This grid size \nis similar to the {transverse full-width-half-maximum} width of GD-1 at 70 pc wide\n\\citep{grillmair2006,gd1}, which is considered a very narrow stream with a {derived} orbit\n\\citep[peri- and apocenters at 14 and 29 kpc;][]{willett09} similar to orbits for our set of streams in this study.\nOur grid size is chosen so that it is sensitive to \nthe particles that have been dispersed away from the main track of the stream by more than that distance.\n\nNote that even though the densities\nof streams with different orbits cannot be compared directly, distributions of the cell occupancies $f(\\eta)$ can tell us\nhow dispersed each stream is. If a stream remains narrow\nwithout much {dispersal}, the occupancy of the grid would be dominated by a few densely occupied cells.\nOn the contrary, if a stream is very dispersed, then the occupancy of the grid would be spread among\nmany sparsely occupied cells.\n\n\n\n\n{Figure \\ref{fig:{count_errors}}} shows the medians and the spreads of the cumulative distributions of cell occupancies\nof 50 streams in each of our halo potentials. The cumulative distributions have been weighted by the occupancies and then normalized\nby the total numbers of particles.
