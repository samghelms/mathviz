However, on small scales the paradigm faces a\nnumber of challenges that could be related to inherent model flaws or\ndue to our poor understanding and modelling of the physical processes\nthat affect galaxies on these scales.\n\nA well known problem is the excess of low--mass dark matter halos\ncompared with the actual number of visible low--mass galaxies.  This\ndiscrepancy is commonly known as the CDM overabundance problem or\nmissing satellite problem \\citep{Moore1999,Klypin1999}. One\nmanifestation of this is evident in the faint--end of neutral hydrogen\n(HI) mass functions \\citep{Papastergis:2011} and in galaxy luminosity\nfunctions \\citep{Klypin:2014}. For example, dark matter only\nsimulations predict a slope for the mass--function of $\\alpha \\sim\n-1.8$, which is in contrast to the significantly shallower slope\n$\\alpha \\sim -1.3$ exhibited for example by the HI mass function of\ngalaxies in the ALFALFA survey \\citep{Martin:2010}.\n\nThe mass and luminosity functions relate to properties of galaxies,\nbut velocity functions are perhaps more revealing because they are\nconnected to the internal properties of the host dark matter\nhalos. \\citet{Papastergis:2014} and \\citet{Klypin:2014} have recently\ndrawn attention to the fact that the velocity function of dark matter\nhalos $dN/d\\log V \\sim V^{\\alpha}$ has $\\alpha \\sim -3$, while\nobservationally $\\alpha \\sim -1$ for galaxies with circular velocities\nsmaller than $\\sim 60~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$.\n\nFurthermore, it has been pointed out that CDM halos hosting\nlow mass galaxies would be too concentrated in comparison to what can\nbe inferred from observations, such as from rotation curves\n\\citep{Ferrero:2012} or velocity dispersions at the half--light radii of\ndwarf galaxies \\citep{Boylan2012}. This is known as the ``too\nbig to fail problem'' which has recently drawn a lot of attention in the literature. \n\n\nWe can classify the solutions to these problems in two types: those\nrelated to baryonic physics and those that propose changes in the\nnature of dark matter \\citep[see e.g.][ for a\nreview]{Kravtsov2010}. Among the many baryonic effects considered we\ncan mention photoheating during the reionization epoch\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Barkana:1999, Bullock:2001a, Shapiro:2004} which results in a\nlower baryon fraction in low mass halos, the inability (or\ninefficiency) of HI cooling for halos with virial temperature below\n10$^4$K \\citep{Haiman2000}, and stellar feedback \\citep[e.g.][]{Dekel:1986,\n  MacLow:1999}. The latter not only acts to lower the baryon fraction\nin low mass galaxies, possibly preventing further star formation in\nthe lowest mass systems, but may also modify the density profiles of\ndark matter halos, making them less concentrated\n\\citep{Governato2012}. On the other hand, warm dark matter or\nself--interacting dark matter models, which effectively result in a\nsuppression in the spectrum of fluctuations of the power on small\nscales, predict an important reduction in the number of small dark\nmatter halos, and possibly systems with lower central densities\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Colin:2000, Kamionkowski:2000, Bode:2001, Kennedy:2014,\n  Polisensky:2014,Vogelsberger2014}\n \nFully cosmological numerical hydrodynamical simulations are just\nbeginning to model reliably these low mass scales, because of the\ndifficulty in addressing simultaneously a large volume with high\nspatial resolution. Amongst the recent works that have discussed the\nissues highlighted above is \\cite{Sawala2014} who have found that a\ncombination of effects related to reionization and environment\nintroduces strong biases in the halos that host dwarf galaxies, and those\nthat remain dark.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use semi--analytic (SA) models combined for example with\na very high--resolution cosmological N--body simulation. For galaxies\nwith neutral hydrogen mass $M_{HI} \\ge 10^8~{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, \\citet{Obreschkow2013} show good agreement\nbetween the properties of gas--rich galaxies in the HIPASS survey to\nthe predictions from a SA model coupled to the\nMillenium dark matter simulation \\citep{Springel2005}.  For lower masses, and using a\ndifferent technique, namely abundance matching,\n\\cite{Papastergis:2014} argue that the ALFALFA survey should be observing a much\nlarger number density of dwarf galaxies given the measured\nrotational velocities.  Along similar lines,\n\\citet{Ga-Kimmel2014a} predict there should be of the order of 1000\ngalaxies with stellar mass $M_* > 10^3 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ to be discovered within $\\sim 3$ Mpc\nfrom the Milky Way (MW). Furthermore, assuming a one--to--one relation\nbetween $M_*$ and $M_{HI}$ these authors predict 50 undiscovered\ngas--rich dwarf galaxies with $M_{HI} >10^5 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ within the local\nvolume. However, care must be taken when applying abundance matching at the low mass\nend (i.e. virial mass $M_{vir} < 10^{10} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$), because this is a regime of strong\nstochasticity where galaxy formation may or may not take place in\nhalos of similar present--day mass depending on whether they were above\nor below a given threshold (e.g. for HI cooling) at higher redshift\n\\citep[see Fig.~16 of][]{Li:2010}.  As we shall see in this Paper\n\\citep[also in][]{Sawala2014}, for virial masses $M_{vir} \\sim 10^{9.5}~{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$\nonly $\\sim 50\\%$ of the halos are expected to host a galaxy. A simple\nabundance matching like--technique that only ranks halos by mass around this mass scale will\nfail \\citep{Sawala:2015}.\n\n\n\\cite{Starkenburg:2013} studied the properties of satellite galaxies\naround Milky Way--like halos combining a SA model with the Aquarius\nsuite of cosmological simulations \\citep{Springel:2008a}.  This model reproduced well the\nluminosity functions as well as e.g. star formation histories of these\nsystems, and it was found that the ``too big to fail'' problem could\nbe solved by invoking a lower total mass for the Milky Way of $\\sim 8 \\times\n10^{11} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ \\citep{Vera-Ciro2013}. However, the model satellites\nhad too high HI fractions, which was attributed to the lack of\nram--pressure stripping of cold gas in the model once a galaxy becomes\na satellite \\citep[see e.g.  Fig.~11 of][who use the same SA model but applied to a \ndifferent cosmological simulation]{Li:2010}.\n\nMotivated by the recent HI surveys such as HIPASS and ALFALFA that\nprobe the lowest mass ends, and by the relative success in solving a\nnumber of problems for low mass satellites, here we use the\n\\citet{Starkenburg:2013} model to focus on the faint galaxies in the\nfield. Although the Aquarius simulation high--resolution box is small \n\\mbox{($\\sim 2.4~h^{-1}$Mpc on a side)}, it is large\nenough to contain several hundred small galaxies whose properties can\nbe contrasted to observations. By focusing on systems in the field, and specifically on central galaxies, we\nshould also be able to establish if the gas content of our galaxies is\nmodelled properly and whether the mismatch found for the satellites is\nonly due to environmental effects.\n\nThis paper is organised as follows.  We describe the most relevant\ncharacteristics of our SA method in Section \\ref{S_sample}.  In\nSection \\ref{S_analysis} we compare the luminosity function (LF), HI mass function and the\nvelocity function for the galaxies in the SA model to those in the\nALFALFA sample from \\cite{Papastergis:2014}. We explore in this section\nthe reasons behind the success of this comparison, and on the failure\nof abundance matching methods on the lower mass end.  In Section\n\\ref{S_Conclusions} we summarise our results and conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Methodology} \\label{S_sample}\n\n\n\\cite{Starkenburg:2013} have used the Aquarius dark matter simulations\nin combination with a semi--analytic galaxy formation model that stems\noriginally from \\cite{DeLucia:2004,Croton:2006,Delucia2007,Delucia2008,Li:2010}. \n\nThe Aquarius halos were identified in the Millennium--II Simulation\n\\citep{Boylan-Kolchin:2009}, a cosmological N--body simulation with the\nfollowing parameters: \\mbox{$\\Omega_{m}$ = 0.25},\n\\mbox{$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ = 0.75}, \\mbox{$\\sigma_{8}$ = 0.9},\n\\mbox{$n_s$ = 1}, \\mbox{$h = 0.73$} and \\mbox{$H_0 = 100 h\n  {\\rm km~s^{-1}}$Mpc}. A series of five zoom--in simulations with progressively\nhigher resolution centered around 6 different Milky Way mass halos \nwere performed, until a particle mass resolution of $m_p \\sim 1.7 \\times\n10^3~{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and spatial resolution of $\\sim 20$~pc were achieved\n\\citep{Springel:2008a}.  \n\nThe SA model of \\cite{Starkenburg:2013} follows a number of important\nphysical processes that affect the evolution of a galaxy, including\nstar formation, feedback, cooling, heating, mergers, etc. We briefly\ndescribe here in more depth those processes that have an important effect on\nlow--mass galaxies, and refer the reader to the papers mentioned\nearlier for more details. In summary: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The {\\it feedback} model corresponds to the \\citet{DeLucia:2004}\n  prescription, in which the gas mass that is reheated by supernovae feedback\n  is $\\propto E_{SN}/V^2_{vir} \\Delta M_*$, i.e. it is inversely\n  proportional to the depth of the potential--well (as given by its virial velocity\n  $V_{vir}$) and proportional to the amount of newly formed stars\n  $\\Delta M_*$.\n\n\\item \\textit{Reionization} is modelled following the simulations of\n  \\cite{Gnedin:2000}, who quantified the effect of\n  photoionization/photoevaporation on low--mass haloes.

Different\ncolours correspond to galaxies residing in the different Aquarius\nlevel--2 simulations.\n\n\nTo normalise these curves, and take into account the relatively small\nvolume sampled by the Aquarius simulations we computed $N_{Mill}$, the\nmean number density of galaxies with B--band absolute magnitude in the\nrange $ -18 < M_B < -14$ in the milli--Millenium catalogue\\footnote{\n  http://gavo.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Millennium/} which uses the\nsemi--analytic model of \\citet{Delucia2007}. In the same way we\ncomputed $N_{AQ}$ for each of the Aquarius simulations, and estimated\nthe normalisation factor as $\\log f = \\log N_{AQ}/N_{Mill}$. \nUsing only central galaxies, this is found to vary from 0.55 for\nAq-E to 0.85 for Aq-A, and this variation is simply due to small\nnumber statistics. Therefore we have decide to take an average\nnormalisation factor $\\log f = 0.7$ and applied this normalisation to\nall our simulations. When using central and satellite galaxies still \nembedded in their own subhalo, the average normalisation factor is, \nas expected, only slightly different, with $\\log f = 0.8$. \nDepending on the systems shown, these normalisations are also \napplied in Figures \\ref{fig:HI} and \\ref{fig:vel}. The black lines\nin the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:lum} show how well the luminosity function has\nconverged by comparing the results for the four different resolutions\nfor central galaxies in the Aq-A series. \n\n\n\nMany studies have estimated the luminosity function in the field\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Norberg:2002, Bell:2003, Blanton:2005,\n  Trujillo-Gomez:2011}, however for the current study it is important\nto know its shape at the faint end. This is why we compare here to the\nluminosity function derived by \\cite{Klypin:2014}.  These authors have\nused the current version of Updated Nearby Catalog\n\\citep{Karachentsev:2013} which contains 869 galaxies with\nredshift--independent distances \\mbox{$D < 11$ Mpc} or radial\nvelocities with respect to centroid of the Local Group \\mbox{$V_{LG} <\n  600$ km $s^{-1}$}.  We focus on the subsample with distances\n\\mbox{$D \\leqslant 10$ Mpc}, which comprises 733 galaxies, of which\n652 objects are brighter than B--band absolute magnitude \\mbox{$M_B = -10$} and 426 are brighter\nthan \\mbox{$M_B = -13$}. The grey filled circles in Figure\n\\ref{fig:lum} represent the resulting luminosity function, while the\ndotted grey curve presents a Schechter fit to this sample for galaxies\nwith \\mbox{$M_B < -14$}, with the following Schechter parameters:\n$\\phi^{*} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2} h^3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, $\\alpha = 1.3$ and\n$M_{*,B} = -20.0 + 5 \\log(h)$ \\citep[Equation (2) of][]{Klypin:2014}.\n\nThis comparison shows that there is reasonable agreement between our\nmodel and the field luminosity function for $M_B < -14$. The inclusion of satellites in the models does not\nlead to a drastic change in the shape or normalisation of the luminosity function, especially if we consider the\nimportant scatter from simulation to simulation. This is a consequence\nof the small volume (and hence relatively small number of objects) of\nthe high--resolution region of the Aquarius halos. Coupled to possible\nincompleteness in the data for galaxies with $M_B > -12$, and the\nsomewhat arbitrary normalisation, it is hard to argue that the\nmodelling needs any improvement. \n\n\n\n\\section{Results on the HI mass function and velocity function} \\label{S_analysis}\n\n\\subsection{Neutral hydrogen (HI) mass function} \\label{sS_HI}\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig3a.ps}\n    \\label{fig:image1HI}\n \\end{minipage}\n \\hfill\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{-52pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig3b.ps}\n   \\label{fig:image2HI}\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\caption{Upper panel: HI mass function of central galaxies for all\n    six halos of Aq-2, with \\mbox{M$_{vir} > $ 10$^{5.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$}\n    and within \\mbox{1.2 Mpc~$h^{-1}$} from the MW (colour solid\n    lines).

This offers an independent test of the model because in low\nmass systems the baryonic budget is dominated by gas rather than by\nstars.\n\nIn the upper panel of Figure \\ref{fig:HI} we show the HI mass\nfunctions of central galaxies for all six Aquarius level--2 halos, for\nwhich \\mbox{M$_{vir} > $ 10$^{5.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$} and located, as\nbefore, in the high--resolution box around the main Milky Way--like\ngalaxies. Each colour corresponds to a different halo.  The\nblack--dashed line shows the HI mass function for central systems that\nhave {\\it both} cold gas and stars, and is the average over all\nAquarius level--2 halos. It evidences that many objects with cold gas\n(with $M_{HI} < 10^{6} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) have not been able to form any stars (see\ndiscussion below). The dot-dashed curve represents the \ncorresponding HI mass function but now including both central and \nsatellite galaxies, i.e. these are the counterparts of the objects \nshown in the top panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:lum}. Note that the two \ncurves follow each other relatively well, and are only offset by \n$\\sim 0.2$ dex at $M_{HI} \\sim 10^{7.5} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. This difference, due \nto satellite galaxies baring HI, is relatively small in comparison to \nthe scatter from simulation to simulation. The black lines in the \nbottom panel of this figure show the HI mass function of the Aq-A halo\nfor the four different resolutions and again indicate very good convergence.\n\n\\cite{Martin:2010} have derived the HI mass function from a sample of\n$\\sim 10^4$ extragalactic sources comprising the ALFALFA $40\\%$\nsurvey (hereafter $\\alpha.40$), with \\mbox{$6.2 <\n  \\log(M_{HI}/{\\rm M_{\\odot}}) < 11.0$}. These are plotted as the grey filled\ncircles in Figure \\ref{fig:HI}.  The grey dotted line is the Schechter\nfunction fit to this dataset with the parameters: $\\phi^{*} = 0.0048$,\n$\\log(M_{*}) = 9.96$ and $\\alpha = -1.33$ as estimated by\n\\citet{Martin:2010}.\n\nThe top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:HI} shows that there is good \nagreement between the observed HI mass function of galaxies with \n$M_{HI} \\sim 10^{6.5} - 10^{9} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and our models. There are, in \nfact, three comparisons to be made: $i$) with all central galaxies \n(including those without a stellar component, the coloured curves); \n$ii$) with central systems that host a luminous galaxy (dashed black \ncurve); and $iii$) with centrals and satellites hosting a luminous \ngalaxy (dot-dashed curve).  One of the reasons to consider these \nthree classes separately rests on our aim to establish if the HI \ncontents of central galaxies (in the field) are \nconsistent with observations, in particular in relation to gauging \nthe impact of environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping \non satellites. Note that in all cases, at the high--mass end our \nsimulation box is too small and does not contain enough galaxies, as \nevidenced by the large error bars in this figure.\n\nThe first point to note is the relatively large scatter from\nsimulation to simulation at intermediate masses for central galaxies,\nalthough all curves are consistent within 1$\\sigma$ of each other, and\non average also consistent with the observed HI mass\nfunction. However, since most objects observed in the ALFALFA survey\nactually have an optical counterpart \\citep[see e.g.][]{Haynes2011}, a\nbetter comparison to make is to the dashed black curve, representing\ncentral luminous galaxies. We note the excellent agreement with the\nobservations at these masses, although for masses $M < 10^{6}\\ {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$,\nthe predicted HI mass function appears to decline to a point that may\nbe in tension with the observations. On the other hand, it is possible\nthat satellite galaxies are present in the observational sample. As\nexpected, when these are included in the predicted HI mass function,\nthere is an increase in the number of objects although the agreement\nwith the observations is still very reasonable. This implies that ram\npressure stripping, although it should be included when modelling the\nproperties of satellite galaxies, will not result in dramatic changes\nthat will break-down the good agreement between the models and the\nobservations, at least for the range of masses probed by the latter.\n\nMore careful comparisons, especially regarding the low mass end of the\nHI mass function and the presence of systems without a stellar\ncounterpart, are necessary. It will be important to have both deeper\nsurveys in HI as well as in the optical, as these will allow us to\nestablish whether the trends predicted are correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:props} we have plotted the B--band absolute magnitude \nagainst the virial mass for all the 173 central galaxies in the\nhigh--resolution region of the Aquarius halos. The panel below shows\nthe HI mass against the virial mass for all these galaxies as red\ncircles, while the open circles denote objects that according to our\nSA model have not formed any stars ($M_* = 0$) but do contain cold\ngas. There are 315 such objects with $M_{vir} \\ge 10^{5.5} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. The\nreason such systems do not form stars is because their surface gas\ndensity is below the threshold for star formation imposed by our\nmodel. \n\nAn estimate of the dependence of the critical mass on the virial mass\nof objects can be obtained using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:mcrit}). In that\nequation, we replace the disk radial scalelength by $\\tilde{r}_d =\n\\lambda r_{vir}/\\sqrt{2} $ where $\\lambda$ is the dimensionless spin\nparameter (which we take to be $\\sim 0.035$) and $r_{vir}$ the virial\nradius of the host halo. As explained earlier, this scale is obtained assuming conservation\nof specific angular momentum, and that when hot gas cools at the\ncentre of dark matter haloes, it settles in a rotationally supported\ndisk \\citep{Mo:1998}. The value of $\\tilde{r}_d$ will typically be\nlarger than $r_d$, because the latter is a mass--weighted average over\nthe whole gas cooling history of the system.  Therefore\n$\\tilde{M}_{crit}$ obtained in this way will be overestimated in\ngeneral. Nonetheless, this rough zero order approximation of the\ncritical mass is plotted as the line in the bottom panel. This\ncomparison serves to tentatively support our claim that the density of\ncold gas in lower mass objects is too low to allow star formation\ntaking place. \n\nIt should also be borne in mind that since the criterion given by Eq.~(\\ref{eq:mcrit}) \nfor the critical mass of gas for star formation is \nstrict and global, it is likely that if some stochasticity\nwould be allowed and density variations inside a system considered,\nthat some systems below the threshold should be able to form\nstars. This implies that the exact predictions for the shape of the HI mass\nfunction for objects around and below $M_{crit}$ should be taken with\na grain of salt.\n\nThis analysis supports the idea that ram pressure \nstripping of gas once a system becomes a satellite will not affect \nthe properties of the objects significantly. Most of the gas present \nin the systems has too low density to form stars, which is \nalso why the luminosity function of galaxies (including satellites) \nis in agreement with observations, even if in our model, \nram pressure has not really been implemented. For this reason, \nin the remainder of this paper we only focus on the behaviour of central galaxies.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n     \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig4a.ps}\n   \\label{fig:image1corr}\n \\end{minipage}\n\\hfill\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{-52pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n      \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig4b.ps}\n      \\label{fig:image2corr}\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\caption{Upper panel: $M_B$ vs $M_{vir}$ for all the central galaxies in our\n    models.

An additional important complementary\naspect concerns the internal dynamics of galaxies, which links the\ngalaxies to their host dark matter halos. A fundamental question that\npotentially relates to the nature of dark matter, is whether the\ngalaxies in the SA model are hosted by the right dark matter halos in\nthe simulations.\n \nThis is why we now focus on velocity function, namely the abundance of\ngalaxies with a given circular velocity \\citep{Cole:1989,\n  Shimasaku:1993, Gonzalez:2000, Zavala:2009, Trujillo-Gomez:2011}. To\nmeasure circular velocities for large numbers of galaxies is\nchallenging, but wide--area, single--dish 21~cm surveys are making this\npossible. Although ideally one would like to obtain full rotation\ncurves for a large number of systems spanning a large range in galaxy\nmass, this is too time--consuming to be currently feasible. Therefore,\nwhat is rather used is the width of the spectral HI line profile\n$w$. This is believed to be close to the peak rotational velocity of\nthe system at approximately two radial scale--lengths.\n\n\\cite{Papastergis:2011} have measured the velocity width function (WF) of\nHI--bearing galaxies down to $ w = 20~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in the ALFALFA survey.  This WF is based on 10,744\nHI--selected galaxies from the $\\alpha.40$ survey (a more than twofold\nincrease over previous data sets), so it is the largest HI--selected\nsample to date.\n\nFor each dark matter halo in the Aquarius suite \\citet{Springel:2008a}\nhas derived the peak circular velocity $V_{max}$ and the circular\nvelocity at the virial radius $v_c(r_{vir}) = V_{vir}$, as well as the\nlocation of the peak $r_{max}$ and the virial radius $r_{vir}$. With\nthis information, and assuming an NFW shape, we may derive the full\nform of the rotation curve. Furthermore, we may derive $v_{rot}$,\ni.e. $v_c(2 r_d)$ using the value of $r_d$ as determined from our SA\nmodel \\footnote{Our results do not change significantly if we instead\n  compute the circular velocity at $r_d$ or at $3 r_d$.}\n\nTo compare this data with the results of \\cite{Papastergis:2011}, we convert rotational \nvelocities into HI velocity widths by assuming the relationship given by Equation (4) \nof \\cite{Papastergis:2011}: \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 12482, "prevtext": "\n\n\\item \\textit{Star Formation} in the quiescent mode (as opposed to in\n  starbursts) is assumed to take place in an exponential thin disc of radial scalelength $r_d$.\nThe mass in cold gas of the disc that is in excess\n  of critical threshold $M_{crit}$ is transformed into stars:\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n M_{crit} = 1.14 \\times 10^8 (V_{vir}/ 20~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}) (r_{d}/1~{\\rm kpc})\n  {\\rm M_{\\odot}},\n\\label{eq:mcrit}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"M_{crit}=1.14\\times 10^{8}(V_{vir}/20~{}{\\rm km~{}s^{-1}})(r_{d}/1~{}{\\rm kpc}%&#10;){\\rm M_{\\odot}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>1.14</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>8</mn></msup></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub><mo>/</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>20</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>km</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>d</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>1</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>kpc</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07554.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis equation indicates that the galaxies are randomly oriented with\nrespect to the line of sight ($\\cos i$ is uniformly distributed in the\n[0, 1] interval), while $w_{eff}$ is a small \"effective\" term used to\nreproduce the broadening effect of turbulence and non--circular motions\non HI linewidths.

The resulting function has a similar\nslope as observed. \n\nIt is interesting to note that in our model, those systems with cold\ngas but lacking stars, lead to an excess above the Schechter function\nthat fits so well the luminous galaxies in our model.

To understand further this result we now zoom into the\nproperties of the halos hosting galaxies.  \n\n\\citet{Papastergis:2014}\nanalysed the kinematics of a sample of gas--rich dwarf galaxies\nextracted from the literature. They derived $v_{rot}$ by making\ninclination corrections using SDSS images, and estimated the value of \n$V_{max}$ by considering the most massive halo that is consistent with\nthe last measured point of the rotation curves available for these\ngalaxies.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig6.ps}\n   \\label{fig:image1}\n \\end{minipage}\n \\hfill\n \\caption{Distribution of $v_{rot}$ vs $V_{max}$ for the dataset from\n   \\citet{Papastergis:2014} (grey solid points), for the dark matter\n   halos hosting our model galaxies (red circles), and for systems in\n   our model that have $M_* = 0$ but $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ (black circles). The blue\n   curve shows the relation predicted by abundance matching given by  \\citet{Papastergis:2014}. The\n   luminous central galaxies in our model occupy the same region as the\n   observations. Note that for $V_{max} > 100~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the rotational \n   velocities of the observed galaxies are systematically higher. This\n   merely reflects that the baryon contribution (which is not taken\n   into account for the model galaxies), is non--negligible for these\n   systems.}\n       \\label{fig:vmax_vrot}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Figure ~\\ref{fig:vmax_vrot} we show the distribution of $v_{rot}$\nvs $V_{max}$ for this dataset (grey solid points) as well as for th \ncentral dark matter halos hosting our model galaxies (red circles). With black\nopen circles with indicate those systems in our model that have $M_* =\n0$ but $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, i.e. they are devoid of stars, and hence\nwould not be in the observational compilation of\n\\citet{Papastergis:2014}. The blue curve shows the relation predicted\nby abundance matching according to \\citet{Papastergis:2014}.\n\nThis comparison is extremely satisfactory and confirms again that\nmodel galaxies are placed in the right host dark matter halos. No\ndiscrepancies are found, and there is no evidence from this plot that\nthe dark matter halos in the simulations would be too massive or too\ndense to host the observed galaxies. \n\nHowever, this is in tension with the naive conclusion that one would\nhave drawn from comparing the observations to the predictions of\nabundance matching. It is important therefore to understand why the\ngalaxies in our model do not follow the predictions of abundance\nmatching. Equally important it is to understand why only halos with\n$V_{max} > 20~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ host luminous galaxies.\n\nThe reason that abundance matching does not work at the low mass end\nof the halo spectrum is that the ability of a halo to host a galaxy\ndepends on its capacity to i) retain the baryons; ii) cool gas from the hot phase; and\niii) have enough cold gas at high density for star formation. These\nconditions are redshift dependent, and hence the virial mass or\nvelocity at the present--day are not sufficient to establish whether a\nhalo will host a galaxy (unless this mass is significantly different from the\nvarious thresholds). Of the halos that are near the thresholds for these\nphysical processes to take place, some fraction will satisfy these\nrequirement, and this fraction is not fully random, and is not mass\nranked (as in abundance matching) but depends on the specific history of the\nhalo. \n\nThis point is made clear by considering the fraction of central halos that\nhost galaxies as a function of virial mass. This is plotted in Figure\n\\ref{fig:mass-fractions}, where the fraction of galaxies with $M_* >\n10^3 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ at a given $M_{vir}$ is indicated by the solid line, and the\nfraction of systems with $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ is given by the dashed\nline. From this figure we see that all halos with $M_{vir} > 10^{10}\n{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ host luminous galaxies, while only $50\\%$ of those with $M_{vir}\n\\sim 10^{9.4} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ do. On the other hand, this function is shifted to lower masses if we\nconsider the systems with cold gas: 50\\% of the halos with\n$M_{vir} = 10^{8.9} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ contain HI. This\nshift is present because, not only must a halo be able to cool gas but\nin order to form stars, this gas must be above the threshold for star\nformation. It is also interesting that these functions are not exactly steps,\nand this is a manifestation of the various processes at work which have different \nthresholds, as discussed above.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig7.ps}\n\n\\end{minipage}\n \\hfill\n \\caption{Fraction of halos hosting a luminous galaxy with $M_* > 10^3 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ (solid) \n         and halos with more than $10^4{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ HI gas (dashed) as function of $M_{vir}$.}\n       \\label{fig:mass-fractions}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:vmax_vvir} shows the $V_{max}$ vs $V_{vir}$ for the central model galaxies as\nred circles, the systems with no stars but with $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ as\nopen black circles, and the dark matter halos without baryons as\ngrey crosses.

In the bottom panel only those of the Aq-A\n     halo are shown for four different resolutions, and evidence the\n   good convergence of the models. }\n       \\label{fig:lum}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe luminosity function, i.e., the abundance of galaxies with a given\nluminosity, is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:lum} for our model. \nThe top panel shows the luminosity functions including central and satellite\ngalaxies, while the bottom two are only for centrals. Different\ncolours correspond to galaxies residing in the different Aquarius\nlevel--2 simulations.\n\n\nTo normalise these curves, and take into account the relatively small\nvolume sampled by the Aquarius simulations we computed $N_{Mill}$, the\nmean number density of galaxies with B--band absolute magnitude in the\nrange $ -18 < M_B < -14$ in the milli--Millenium catalogue\\footnote{\n  http://gavo.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Millennium/} which uses the\nsemi--analytic model of \\citet{Delucia2007}. In the same way we\ncomputed $N_{AQ}$ for each of the Aquarius simulations, and estimated\nthe normalisation factor as $\\log f = \\log N_{AQ}/N_{Mill}$. \nUsing only central galaxies, this is found to vary from 0.55 for\nAq-E to 0.85 for Aq-A, and this variation is simply due to small\nnumber statistics. Therefore we have decide to take an average\nnormalisation factor $\\log f = 0.7$ and applied this normalisation to\nall our simulations. When using central and satellite galaxies still \nembedded in their own subhalo, the average normalisation factor is, \nas expected, only slightly different, with $\\log f = 0.8$. \nDepending on the systems shown, these normalisations are also \napplied in Figures \\ref{fig:HI} and \\ref{fig:vel}. The black lines\nin the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:lum} show how well the luminosity function has\nconverged by comparing the results for the four different resolutions\nfor central galaxies in the Aq-A series. \n\n\n\nMany studies have estimated the luminosity function in the field\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Norberg:2002, Bell:2003, Blanton:2005,\n  Trujillo-Gomez:2011}, however for the current study it is important\nto know its shape at the faint end. This is why we compare here to the\nluminosity function derived by \\cite{Klypin:2014}.  These authors have\nused the current version of Updated Nearby Catalog\n\\citep{Karachentsev:2013} which contains 869 galaxies with\nredshift--independent distances \\mbox{$D < 11$ Mpc} or radial\nvelocities with respect to centroid of the Local Group \\mbox{$V_{LG} <\n  600$ km $s^{-1}$}.  We focus on the subsample with distances\n\\mbox{$D \\leqslant 10$ Mpc}, which comprises 733 galaxies, of which\n652 objects are brighter than B--band absolute magnitude \\mbox{$M_B = -10$} and 426 are brighter\nthan \\mbox{$M_B = -13$}. The grey filled circles in Figure\n\\ref{fig:lum} represent the resulting luminosity function, while the\ndotted grey curve presents a Schechter fit to this sample for galaxies\nwith \\mbox{$M_B < -14$}, with the following Schechter parameters:\n$\\phi^{*} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2} h^3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, $\\alpha = 1.3$ and\n$M_{*,B} = -20.0 + 5 \\log(h)$ \\citep[Equation (2) of][]{Klypin:2014}.\n\nThis comparison shows that there is reasonable agreement between our\nmodel and the field luminosity function for $M_B < -14$. The inclusion of satellites in the models does not\nlead to a drastic change in the shape or normalisation of the luminosity function, especially if we consider the\nimportant scatter from simulation to simulation. This is a consequence\nof the small volume (and hence relatively small number of objects) of\nthe high--resolution region of the Aquarius halos. Coupled to possible\nincompleteness in the data for galaxies with $M_B > -12$, and the\nsomewhat arbitrary normalisation, it is hard to argue that the\nmodelling needs any improvement. \n\n\n\n\\section{Results on the HI mass function and velocity function} \\label{S_analysis}\n\n\\subsection{Neutral hydrogen (HI) mass function} \\label{sS_HI}\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig3a.ps}\n    \\label{fig:image1HI}\n \\end{minipage}\n \\hfill\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{-52pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig3b.ps}\n   \\label{fig:image2HI}\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\caption{Upper panel: HI mass function of central galaxies for all\n    six halos of Aq-2, with \\mbox{M$_{vir} > $ 10$^{5.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$}\n    and within \\mbox{1.2 Mpc~$h^{-1}$} from the MW (colour solid\n    lines).

To\nfurther explore this difference we now focus on the HI mass\nfunction. This offers an independent test of the model because in low\nmass systems the baryonic budget is dominated by gas rather than by\nstars.\n\nIn the upper panel of Figure \\ref{fig:HI} we show the HI mass\nfunctions of central galaxies for all six Aquarius level--2 halos, for\nwhich \\mbox{M$_{vir} > $ 10$^{5.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$} and located, as\nbefore, in the high--resolution box around the main Milky Way--like\ngalaxies. Each colour corresponds to a different halo.  The\nblack--dashed line shows the HI mass function for central systems that\nhave {\\it both} cold gas and stars, and is the average over all\nAquarius level--2 halos. It evidences that many objects with cold gas\n(with $M_{HI} < 10^{6} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) have not been able to form any stars (see\ndiscussion below). The dot-dashed curve represents the \ncorresponding HI mass function but now including both central and \nsatellite galaxies, i.e. these are the counterparts of the objects \nshown in the top panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:lum}. Note that the two \ncurves follow each other relatively well, and are only offset by \n$\\sim 0.2$ dex at $M_{HI} \\sim 10^{7.5} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. This difference, due \nto satellite galaxies baring HI, is relatively small in comparison to \nthe scatter from simulation to simulation. The black lines in the \nbottom panel of this figure show the HI mass function of the Aq-A halo\nfor the four different resolutions and again indicate very good convergence.\n\n\\cite{Martin:2010} have derived the HI mass function from a sample of\n$\\sim 10^4$ extragalactic sources comprising the ALFALFA $40\\%$\nsurvey (hereafter $\\alpha.40$), with \\mbox{$6.2 <\n  \\log(M_{HI}/{\\rm M_{\\odot}}) < 11.0$}. These are plotted as the grey filled\ncircles in Figure \\ref{fig:HI}.  The grey dotted line is the Schechter\nfunction fit to this dataset with the parameters: $\\phi^{*} = 0.0048$,\n$\\log(M_{*}) = 9.96$ and $\\alpha = -1.33$ as estimated by\n\\citet{Martin:2010}.\n\nThe top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:HI} shows that there is good \nagreement between the observed HI mass function of galaxies with \n$M_{HI} \\sim 10^{6.5} - 10^{9} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and our models. There are, in \nfact, three comparisons to be made: $i$) with all central galaxies \n(including those without a stellar component, the coloured curves); \n$ii$) with central systems that host a luminous galaxy (dashed black \ncurve); and $iii$) with centrals and satellites hosting a luminous \ngalaxy (dot-dashed curve).  One of the reasons to consider these \nthree classes separately rests on our aim to establish if the HI \ncontents of central galaxies (in the field) are \nconsistent with observations, in particular in relation to gauging \nthe impact of environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping \non satellites. Note that in all cases, at the high--mass end our \nsimulation box is too small and does not contain enough galaxies, as \nevidenced by the large error bars in this figure.\n\nThe first point to note is the relatively large scatter from\nsimulation to simulation at intermediate masses for central galaxies,\nalthough all curves are consistent within 1$\\sigma$ of each other, and\non average also consistent with the observed HI mass\nfunction. However, since most objects observed in the ALFALFA survey\nactually have an optical counterpart \\citep[see e.g.][]{Haynes2011}, a\nbetter comparison to make is to the dashed black curve, representing\ncentral luminous galaxies. We note the excellent agreement with the\nobservations at these masses, although for masses $M < 10^{6}\\ {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$,\nthe predicted HI mass function appears to decline to a point that may\nbe in tension with the observations. On the other hand, it is possible\nthat satellite galaxies are present in the observational sample. As\nexpected, when these are included in the predicted HI mass function,\nthere is an increase in the number of objects although the agreement\nwith the observations is still very reasonable. This implies that ram\npressure stripping, although it should be included when modelling the\nproperties of satellite galaxies, will not result in dramatic changes\nthat will break-down the good agreement between the models and the\nobservations, at least for the range of masses probed by the latter.\n\nMore careful comparisons, especially regarding the low mass end of the\nHI mass function and the presence of systems without a stellar\ncounterpart, are necessary. It will be important to have both deeper\nsurveys in HI as well as in the optical, as these will allow us to\nestablish whether the trends predicted are correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:props} we have plotted the B--band absolute magnitude \nagainst the virial mass for all the 173 central galaxies in the\nhigh--resolution region of the Aquarius halos. The panel below shows\nthe HI mass against the virial mass for all these galaxies as red\ncircles, while the open circles denote objects that according to our\nSA model have not formed any stars ($M_* = 0$) but do contain cold\ngas. There are 315 such objects with $M_{vir} \\ge 10^{5.5} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. The\nreason such systems do not form stars is because their surface gas\ndensity is below the threshold for star formation imposed by our\nmodel. \n\nAn estimate of the dependence of the critical mass on the virial mass\nof objects can be obtained using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:mcrit}). In that\nequation, we replace the disk radial scalelength by $\\tilde{r}_d =\n\\lambda r_{vir}/\\sqrt{2} $ where $\\lambda$ is the dimensionless spin\nparameter (which we take to be $\\sim 0.035$) and $r_{vir}$ the virial\nradius of the host halo. As explained earlier, this scale is obtained assuming conservation\nof specific angular momentum, and that when hot gas cools at the\ncentre of dark matter haloes, it settles in a rotationally supported\ndisk \\citep{Mo:1998}. The value of $\\tilde{r}_d$ will typically be\nlarger than $r_d$, because the latter is a mass--weighted average over\nthe whole gas cooling history of the system.  Therefore\n$\\tilde{M}_{crit}$ obtained in this way will be overestimated in\ngeneral. Nonetheless, this rough zero order approximation of the\ncritical mass is plotted as the line in the bottom panel. This\ncomparison serves to tentatively support our claim that the density of\ncold gas in lower mass objects is too low to allow star formation\ntaking place. \n\nIt should also be borne in mind that since the criterion given by Eq.~(\\ref{eq:mcrit}) \nfor the critical mass of gas for star formation is \nstrict and global, it is likely that if some stochasticity\nwould be allowed and density variations inside a system considered,\nthat some systems below the threshold should be able to form\nstars. This implies that the exact predictions for the shape of the HI mass\nfunction for objects around and below $M_{crit}$ should be taken with\na grain of salt.\n\nThis analysis supports the idea that ram pressure \nstripping of gas once a system becomes a satellite will not affect \nthe properties of the objects significantly. Most of the gas present \nin the systems has too low density to form stars, which is \nalso why the luminosity function of galaxies (including satellites) \nis in agreement with observations, even if in our model, \nram pressure has not really been implemented. For this reason, \nin the remainder of this paper we only focus on the behaviour of central galaxies.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n     \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig4a.ps}\n   \\label{fig:image1corr}\n \\end{minipage}\n\\hfill\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{-52pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n      \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig4b.ps}\n      \\label{fig:image2corr}\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\caption{Upper panel: $M_B$ vs $M_{vir}$ for all the central galaxies in our\n    models.

An additional important complementary\naspect concerns the internal dynamics of galaxies, which links the\ngalaxies to their host dark matter halos. A fundamental question that\npotentially relates to the nature of dark matter, is whether the\ngalaxies in the SA model are hosted by the right dark matter halos in\nthe simulations.\n \nThis is why we now focus on velocity function, namely the abundance of\ngalaxies with a given circular velocity \\citep{Cole:1989,\n  Shimasaku:1993, Gonzalez:2000, Zavala:2009, Trujillo-Gomez:2011}. To\nmeasure circular velocities for large numbers of galaxies is\nchallenging, but wide--area, single--dish 21~cm surveys are making this\npossible. Although ideally one would like to obtain full rotation\ncurves for a large number of systems spanning a large range in galaxy\nmass, this is too time--consuming to be currently feasible. Therefore,\nwhat is rather used is the width of the spectral HI line profile\n$w$. This is believed to be close to the peak rotational velocity of\nthe system at approximately two radial scale--lengths.\n\n\\cite{Papastergis:2011} have measured the velocity width function (WF) of\nHI--bearing galaxies down to $ w = 20~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in the ALFALFA survey.  This WF is based on 10,744\nHI--selected galaxies from the $\\alpha.40$ survey (a more than twofold\nincrease over previous data sets), so it is the largest HI--selected\nsample to date.\n\nFor each dark matter halo in the Aquarius suite \\citet{Springel:2008a}\nhas derived the peak circular velocity $V_{max}$ and the circular\nvelocity at the virial radius $v_c(r_{vir}) = V_{vir}$, as well as the\nlocation of the peak $r_{max}$ and the virial radius $r_{vir}$. With\nthis information, and assuming an NFW shape, we may derive the full\nform of the rotation curve. Furthermore, we may derive $v_{rot}$,\ni.e. $v_c(2 r_d)$ using the value of $r_d$ as determined from our SA\nmodel \\footnote{Our results do not change significantly if we instead\n  compute the circular velocity at $r_d$ or at $3 r_d$.}\n\nTo compare this data with the results of \\cite{Papastergis:2011}, we convert rotational \nvelocities into HI velocity widths by assuming the relationship given by Equation (4) \nof \\cite{Papastergis:2011}: \n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mbox{$w = 2v_{rot} \\sin i + w_{eff}$} \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"w=2v_{rot}\\sin i+w_{eff}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>w</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07554.tex", "nexttext": "\nand \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 41954, "prevtext": "\nThis equation indicates that the galaxies are randomly oriented with\nrespect to the line of sight ($\\cos i$ is uniformly distributed in the\n[0, 1] interval), while $w_{eff}$ is a small \"effective\" term used to\nreproduce the broadening effect of turbulence and non--circular motions\non HI linewidths.

The velocity function considering only systems with a stellar\ncounterpart (i.e. $M_* > 0$) averaged over all six Aquarius halos is\nshown as the dashed black curve.\n\nThe grey filled circles in the same figure represent the measured\nALFALFA WF presented by \\cite{Papastergis:2011}, based on galaxies\nwhich are positioned in the portion of the flux--width plane where the\nALFALFA survey is complete and have profile widths broader than\n\\mbox{$w \\gtrsim 20$ km $s^{-1} $}.

It shows that our model places\ngalaxies of the right baryonic content (in stars and in HI gas) in the\n``right'' dark matter halos. Contrary to previous work \\citep[see\ne.g.][ and references therein]{Papastergis:2014}, our model does not\npresent an excess of luminous galaxies with too low velocity widths\ncompared to the observations. The resulting function has a similar\nslope as observed. \n\nIt is interesting to note that in our model, those systems with cold\ngas but lacking stars, lead to an excess above the Schechter function\nthat fits so well the luminous galaxies in our model. This excess only\nappears for $\\log w \\sim 1.2 - 1.5$, which is right around, and slightly\nbelow the limit of the ALFALFA survey.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig5.ps}\n\\end{minipage}\n \\caption{Velocity width function of central galaxies within \\mbox{1.2\n     Mpc~$h^{-1}$} from the centre of the MW--like Aquarius halos, with\n   \\mbox{M$_{HI} > $ 10$^{4}$ M$_{\\odot}$} and with \\mbox{M$_{vir} > $\n     10$^{5.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$} for the all six halos of resolution\n   level--2 (coloured lines).

To understand further this result we now zoom into the\nproperties of the halos hosting galaxies.  \n\n\\citet{Papastergis:2014}\nanalysed the kinematics of a sample of gas--rich dwarf galaxies\nextracted from the literature. They derived $v_{rot}$ by making\ninclination corrections using SDSS images, and estimated the value of \n$V_{max}$ by considering the most massive halo that is consistent with\nthe last measured point of the rotation curves available for these\ngalaxies.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig6.ps}\n   \\label{fig:image1}\n \\end{minipage}\n \\hfill\n \\caption{Distribution of $v_{rot}$ vs $V_{max}$ for the dataset from\n   \\citet{Papastergis:2014} (grey solid points), for the dark matter\n   halos hosting our model galaxies (red circles), and for systems in\n   our model that have $M_* = 0$ but $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ (black circles). The blue\n   curve shows the relation predicted by abundance matching given by  \\citet{Papastergis:2014}. The\n   luminous central galaxies in our model occupy the same region as the\n   observations. Note that for $V_{max} > 100~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the rotational \n   velocities of the observed galaxies are systematically higher. This\n   merely reflects that the baryon contribution (which is not taken\n   into account for the model galaxies), is non--negligible for these\n   systems.}\n       \\label{fig:vmax_vrot}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Figure ~\\ref{fig:vmax_vrot} we show the distribution of $v_{rot}$\nvs $V_{max}$ for this dataset (grey solid points) as well as for th \ncentral dark matter halos hosting our model galaxies (red circles). With black\nopen circles with indicate those systems in our model that have $M_* =\n0$ but $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, i.e. they are devoid of stars, and hence\nwould not be in the observational compilation of\n\\citet{Papastergis:2014}. The blue curve shows the relation predicted\nby abundance matching according to \\citet{Papastergis:2014}.\n\nThis comparison is extremely satisfactory and confirms again that\nmodel galaxies are placed in the right host dark matter halos. No\ndiscrepancies are found, and there is no evidence from this plot that\nthe dark matter halos in the simulations would be too massive or too\ndense to host the observed galaxies. \n\nHowever, this is in tension with the naive conclusion that one would\nhave drawn from comparing the observations to the predictions of\nabundance matching. It is important therefore to understand why the\ngalaxies in our model do not follow the predictions of abundance\nmatching. Equally important it is to understand why only halos with\n$V_{max} > 20~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ host luminous galaxies.\n\nThe reason that abundance matching does not work at the low mass end\nof the halo spectrum is that the ability of a halo to host a galaxy\ndepends on its capacity to i) retain the baryons; ii) cool gas from the hot phase; and\niii) have enough cold gas at high density for star formation. These\nconditions are redshift dependent, and hence the virial mass or\nvelocity at the present--day are not sufficient to establish whether a\nhalo will host a galaxy (unless this mass is significantly different from the\nvarious thresholds). Of the halos that are near the thresholds for these\nphysical processes to take place, some fraction will satisfy these\nrequirement, and this fraction is not fully random, and is not mass\nranked (as in abundance matching) but depends on the specific history of the\nhalo. \n\nThis point is made clear by considering the fraction of central halos that\nhost galaxies as a function of virial mass. This is plotted in Figure\n\\ref{fig:mass-fractions}, where the fraction of galaxies with $M_* >\n10^3 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ at a given $M_{vir}$ is indicated by the solid line, and the\nfraction of systems with $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ is given by the dashed\nline. From this figure we see that all halos with $M_{vir} > 10^{10}\n{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ host luminous galaxies, while only $50\\%$ of those with $M_{vir}\n\\sim 10^{9.4} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ do. On the other hand, this function is shifted to lower masses if we\nconsider the systems with cold gas: 50\\% of the halos with\n$M_{vir} = 10^{8.9} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ contain HI. This\nshift is present because, not only must a halo be able to cool gas but\nin order to form stars, this gas must be above the threshold for star\nformation. It is also interesting that these functions are not exactly steps,\nand this is a manifestation of the various processes at work which have different \nthresholds, as discussed above.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig7.ps}\n\n\\end{minipage}\n \\hfill\n \\caption{Fraction of halos hosting a luminous galaxy with $M_* > 10^3 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ (solid) \n         and halos with more than $10^4{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ HI gas (dashed) as function of $M_{vir}$.}\n       \\label{fig:mass-fractions}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:vmax_vvir} shows the $V_{max}$ vs $V_{vir}$ for the central model galaxies as\nred circles, the systems with no stars but with $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ as\nopen black circles, and the dark matter halos without baryons as\ngrey crosses. This demonstrates clearly that virial velocity today\n$V_{vir}$ is not enough to predict if a halo will host a luminous\ngalaxy. It also shows that at a given $V_{vir}$, luminous galaxies are\nhosted in halos with higher $V_{max}$. This implies that for a given\n$V_{vir}$ these are the most concentrated halos since for a NFW halo:\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nV_{max} = 0.465 V_{vir} \\left(\\frac{c}{f(c)}\\right)^{1/2}\n\\label{eq:vmax-vvir}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"V_{max}=0.465V_{vir}\\left(\\frac{c}{f(c)}\\right)^{1/2}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>0.465</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>c</mi><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07554.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $c = r_{vir}/r_s$ is the concentration, with $r_s$ the scale radius of the halo.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{minipage}[t]{\\linewidth}\\vspace{0pt}\\hspace{-25pt}\n\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.2\\linewidth]{Fig8.ps}\n\\end{minipage}\n \\hfill\n \\caption{Distribution of $V_{vir}$ vs $V_{max}$ for the central dark matter\n   halos hosting our model galaxies (red circles), for systems in our\n   model that have $M_* = 0$ but $M_{HI} > 10^4 {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ (black open\n   circles) and for completely dark halos (grey crosses). }\n       \\label{fig:vmax_vvir}\n\\end{figure}\nThese more concentrated halos will have typically collapsed earlier,\nimplying that they reach a higher mass at earlier times which\ntherefore increases their likelihood of being above e.g. the HI\ncooling limit at which point they can start forming stars if they have\nretained enough baryons (after photoevaporation). \n\n\nThis also explains why the hosts of luminous galaxies are to the left of \nthe abundance matching curves, since\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 42070, "prevtext": "\nand \n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nf(c) = \\ln (1+c) - c/(1+c)\n\\label{eq:fc}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f(c)=\\ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>/</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07554.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $f(x)$ is given by Eq.~(\\ref{eq:fc}) with $x = 2 r_d/r_s$. In\ngeneral, we can assume that $x \\lesssim 2$ (i.e. $r_d < r_s$), in\nwhich case $f(x)/x$, increases with increasing $x$. This implies that\nfor fixed $r_d$, galaxies with smaller $r_s$ (i.e. in more\nconcentrated halos), have larger $V_{rot}/V_{max}$. In other words\n$V_{max}$ at fixed $V_{rot}$ is lower for more concentrated halos.\nThis highlights that for abundance matching to work, it is important\nto select halos that are most concentrated\namongst those that are near the thresholds. \n\nFigure \\ref{fig:vmax_vvir} shows that dark halos (grey crosses) have\n$V_{vir} < 20 ~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, which is consistent with the fact that the HI cooling\nlimit is $V_{vir}^{cool} \\sim 16.7~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$. Eq.~(\\ref{eq:vmax-vvir})\nexplains why basically all objects with $V_{max} \\lesssim 20~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ are\ndark, as the function $\\sqrt{c/f(c)}$ is weakly dependent on $c$. Since\nhalos hosting luminous galaxies are on average in more concentrated\nhalos as discussed above, their $V_{max}$ is higher as seen in\nthis figure.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions} \\label{S_Conclusions}\n\nWe have used the high--resolution Aquarius cosmological dark matter\nsimulations in combination with the semi--analytic model by\n\\citet{Starkenburg:2013} to study the HI content and dynamical\nproperties of galaxies at the low mass end in the context of the\n\\mbox{$\\Lambda$CDM} paradigm. We have compared our predictions to the\nobserved ALFALFA survey, and found excellent agreement with the HI\nmass and velocity width functions measured by this survey for \ncentral galaxies, down to the lowest mass scales probed. \nImplicit in this conclusion, is our assumption that luminous \nsatellite galaxies do not contribute significantly to these HI \ndistribution functions. This is based on the fact that even if these \nsystems are considered when computing the model HI mass function, \nwe still find good agreement with observations, and the same is \ntrue for the luminosity function. Therefore, even if we do not \ninclude the effect of ram pressure stripping in our models \nexplicitly, we argue that its effect will not lead to dramatic \nchanges in the properties of galaxies. This is because the gas that is \npresent in these systems is too diffuse to contribute to star \nformation, and hence have an impact on the evolution of these objects.\n\nWe have also studied the relation between two global parameters of \nthe circular velocity curves of the galaxies in our models and in \nthe ALFALFA survey, namely between their peak velocity and circular \nvelocity at 2 radial disk scalelengths. The distribution found in \nour models overlaps perfectly with that inferred from observations. \nThis suggests that our galaxies are placed in the right dark matter \nhalos, and consequently and at face value we do not seem to find any \ndiscrepancy with the predictions from the \\mbox{$\\Lambda$CDM} model.\n\nOur model predicts the existence of a population of HI halos that do\nnot have a stellar counterpart \\citep[e.g.][]{Salvadori:2012}. \nThe exact abundance of these objects is likely to depend rather strongly on \nthe implementation of star formation in the models, including whether \ncooling below $10^4 K$ is allowed (via $H_2$) and on the critical density \nfloor for star formation. Although these objects are relatively gas--rich, \ntheir cold gas is too diffuse. Furthermore, their baryon fraction is well below\nuniversal, since typically $f_b \\le 0.01$, reflecting the fact\nthat they lost an important fraction of baryons because of\nphotoevaporation during reionization.\n\\\\\n\n\\label{acknowledgements}\nWe are grateful to Manolis Papastergis and Simon White for interesting\ndiscussions and the Aquarius project members, especially to Volker\nSpringel.
