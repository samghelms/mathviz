This experiment succeeded in demonstrating the quantum to classical crossover by destroying the interferences, and showed Anderson localisation in a quantum walk system.\n\nIn the next step, the concept of time-multiplexed quantum walks was extended to the second dimension with the first experiment of a quantum walk on a 2-dimensional lattice \\cite{schreiber_2d_2012}. \nSince this situation is mathematically equivalent to two walkers in one dimension, this system can be used as a highly controllable simulator for various 2-particle interactions in one dimension.\nStill, all of these implementations have been realized on a static underlying graph and the principle of time-multiplexed appeared to be incompatible with reconfigurations  of the lattice structure.\nIn order to overcome this restriction, a sophisticated double-step scheme was invented, which allowed the demonstration of a quantum walk on a dynamical percolation graph \\cite{elster_quantum_2015}.\nSuch a graph is defined as having its edges probabilistically added or removed in time to imitate porous or fluctuating media.\nUsing a quantum walk on a dynamical percolation graph, subtle decoherence effects in presence of randomly distributed, fluctuating gap defects were studied and clear signatures of non-Markovian behaviour were observed.\n\nIn this article, we present three new applications to further emphasize the capabilities and the flexibility of our current time-multiplexed quantum walk setup:\nFirst, we show the walker's time evolution on finite graphs with variable sizes.\nSecond, we exploit the dynamical coin to prepare for the first time in-situ non-localised initial states with controlled polarization and well-defined phase.\nBy comparing their evolution, their strong dependency on the input polarization is revealed.\nAnd third, we demonstrate a state transfer scheme as suggested in \\cite{zhan_perfect_2014} and route an arbitrary and unknown initial state to two different detector positions achieving high fidelities between input and output state up to 99.4\\%.\nWe find the predicted periodicity in the time dynamics of the walker localizing at the original position \\cite{zhan_perfect_2014}.\n\nThe article is structured as follows:\nIt starts with a conceptual introduction and a review of time-multiplexed quantum walks with dynamical coin control in section \\ref{sec:concepts}, including the description of time-multiplexing and the fundamentals on dynamical coin control. \nThen we present the experimental implementation of the quantum walk with a dynamically controlled coin in section \\ref{sec:exp_imp}. \nHere, we also provide details on experimental challenges and difficulties inherent in the nature of time-multiplexed systems and give insights into the realised solutions.\nThese concern the concrete timings, how to handle the different power levels and how to deal with the ubiquitous losses. \nSection \\ref{sec:results} is dedicated to the presentation of the experimental results of the three applications of the dynamical coin: the implementation of a finite walk, in-situ preparation of non-localised initial states and the demonstration of state transfer schemes. \nFinally, we conclude in section \\ref{sec:conclusion}.\n\n\\section{Concepts}\n\\label{sec:concepts}\n\\subsection{Fundamentals} \n\\label{subsec:fundamentals}\nThe concept of quantum walks merges the classical model of the random walk with the quantum mechanical description of a system via its wave function. \nFrom the classical random walk originates the idea that the walker's path is determined by a coin toss. \nWhile the walker takes one of the possible paths in a classical random walk, in a quantum walk the amplitude of the wave function is split up into components taking the different paths. \nThis results in the superposition of components originating from different paths and consequently interference effects are observed. \n\\\\\nThe state ${| \\Psi \\rangle}$ of the quantum walker is described by a vector in a tensor product space $\\mathcal{H}_x\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_c$ of a position Hilbert space $\\mathcal H_x$ and a coin Hilbert space $\\mathcal H_c$.\nLet $| x \\rangle $ and $| c \\rangle $ denote the basis vectors of the position and the coin space then we can write the full wave function at time $t$ as:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n| \\Psi (t) \\rangle =  \\sum_x \\sum_c a_{x,c}(t)| x \\rangle \\otimes | c\\rangle ~.\n\\label{eq:Psi}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml":

\n\\label{subsec:multiplex}\nWe realise the DTQW with a single photonic walker and use its polarisation as the coin state.\nImplementing the quantum walk with the position as the external degree of freedom, however, limits the scalability of the setup (for the example of a Galton board-like beam splitter cascade the number of components increases quadratically with the number of steps).\nAdditionally, decoherence effects will occur due to experimental inaccuracies of the growing number of components. \nThus, we take a different approach and apply a loop geometry \\cite{schreiber_photons_2010}: \nThe concept of time-multiplexing is based on encoding the external state of the quantum walker into the time domain  (see Figure \\ref{fig:Setup}). \nInitialising a photonic quantum walk, a coherent laser pulse is sent into the setup with a given input polarisation. \nFirst, the pulse passes standard wave plates or a fast switching electro-optic modulator (EOM), which realise the desired coin operation (see sec. \\ref{subsec:graph_implement} for details).\nThen, a polarisation dependent splitting of the pulse is carried out by a polarising beam splitter (PBS).\nBy routing the pulses afterwards through single-mode fibres (SMF) of different lengths we introduce a well-defined time delay between them.\nThis splitting operation in combination with the time delay and the subsequent merging of the paths at the second PBS constitutes one shift of the time-multiplexed quantum walk according to eq. \\ref{eq:Step}. \nWe interpret the part arriving earlier as having undergone a reduction of the position by one and the component arriving later as having been subjected to an increase of the position by one.\nHence, every spatial position is uniquely represented by its arrival time.\n\n\t\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{1D_walk_300_samples.png}\n\t\\caption{Schematic of our implementation of a

operation, the output is again fed into the setup, resulting in a loop-like architecture of the experimental implementation.\nIn every step a small amount of intensity is coupled out and send to the detection unit consisting of another PBS and two avalanche photodiodes (APDs) allowing for polarisation resolved measurements of the walker's time evolution.\n\\\\\nFigure \\ref{fig:Timings_Sketch} illustrates the 3 relevant timings in the time-multiplexed quantum walk: The splitting of the two polarisation components introduces a delay of $\\tau_\\mathrm{Pos}$ between them given by the length difference between the two SMFs.\nThe roundtrip time $\\tau_\\mathrm{RT}$ is defined by the length of the shorter fibre (plus the free-space parts) and denotes the step separation.\nTwo subsequent experiments are delayed by $\\tau_\\mathrm{Rep}$ which must be set long enough to observe the desired number of steps without overlapping.\\\\\nThe proper tailoring of these timings is essential for the time-multiplexing scheme and we dedicate sec. \\ref{subsec:Timings} to its experimental details.\n\n\n\t\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering

counts for horizontally polarized light by orange bars (schematically)}\n\t\\label{fig:Timings_Sketch}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical coin and dynamical graph} \n\\label{subsec:graph_implement}\nAs described above a quantum walk includes a coin operation acting on the internal degree of freedom, in our case the polarisation.\nIn the experiment the polarisation can be statically rotated in a straight-forward way by applying retardation plates. \nFor example a typical coin, implemented by a half-wave plate (HWP) at an angle of $22.5^\\circ$, is the Hadamard coin, which transforms an input comprising one polarization into a fair superposition of both polarizations. \nAnother balanced coin can be implemented by a quarter-wave plate (QWP) at an angle of $45^\\circ$ (see subsection \\ref{subsec:dyna_coin}).\nSuch devices in a loop architecture can only realise static operations, which means they are the same for all steps and positions.\n\\\\\nIntroducing a dynamical coin dramatically increases the versatility of a quantum walk as a model system: It offers new possibilities, e.g. in altering the structure of the underlying graph \\cite{elster_quantum_2015} (see also subsection \\ref{subsec:finite}) as well as in ``in-situ'' preparation of the initial state of the quantum walk (see subsection \\ref{subsec:state_prep}). \n\\\\\nA direct manipulation of the graph structure would mean to modify the step operator which carries the information on the walker's possible paths.\nSince in our setup the step operation is realised by a fixed combination of PBSs and SMFs this can obviously \\emph{not} be dynamically changed.\nHowever, the displacement direction in the step operation depends on the polarisation (see equation \\ref{eq:Step}) and the polarization can be addressed dynamically via fast switching EOMs.\nThus a clever manipulation of the polarization allows to prevent that intensity from a certain position is shifted in a certain direction (e.g. to the right), which is the same effect as breaking the respective link (in this case the right one) would have.\n\n\\\\\nWe will present here in more detail how the dynamical coin is harnessed for the implementation of a quantum walk on a finite graph:\nFigure \\ref{fig:Kaskade_Timings} shows in a Galton board-like scheme a possible evolution of the walker using two specific coin operations, the reflection and the transmission. \nA reflection operation $\\hat{R}$ (grey box) denotes a polarization switching from $| H \\rangle$ to $| V \\rangle$ and vice versa.\nLeaving the polarisations unchanged corresponds to the transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ (white box). \nIn the given example, we intend to limit the spread of the walker's external state to the positions $-1,0,1$, thus it must not evolve into the red areas. \nThis corresponds to a reflection operator at $x= -1$ for the left boundary and at $x = 1$ for the right boundary.\n\n\\\\\nThe example illustrates on the one hand that time-multiplexing techniques in combination with dynamical coin control provides a powerful tool for implementing not only dynamical coin operations but also non-trivial graph structures. \nOn the other hand, it also shows the significance of properly timed polarisation switchings, which require accurate engineering of the hardware and the software of the setup. \nThe presentation of its details will be given in the following sections.\n\n\t\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Kaskade_Timings_2.png}\n\t\\caption{Illustration of how the spread of the walker's external state is limited via polarisation switching; a reflection $\\hat{R}$ is represented by a grey box and switches the horizontal (red lines) into vertical (blue lines) polarization and vice versa. The transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ is represented by a white box leaving the polarizations unchanged. Note that in the setup the spatial position is in the experiment mapped into the time domain.}\n\t\\label{fig:Kaskade_Timings}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Implementation of dynamical coin operations via an EOM}\t \n\\label{subsec:dyna_coin}\nFor the implementation of non-trivial graphs a device is needed that switches between reflection and transmission operations $\\hat{R}$, $\\hat{T}$ and, possibly, a third mixing coin $\\hat{C}$.\nIn order to address single positions the device must exhibit a switching speed that is comparable to the position separation $\\tau_\\mathrm{Pos}$ (here: 46.5\\,ns).\n\nIn order to meet the challenging requirements on homogeneity, accuracy of rotation angle and switching speed, we thus apply an electro-optic modulator (EOM, see Figure \\ref{fig:EOM}).\nThis device operates based on the Pockels effect to manipulate the polarization of light passing through it: The refractive index of a medium is changed along the direction of an applied voltage, thus introducing or altering birefringence, which can be done at high speeds.\nThe Pockels cell used in the setup consists of a rubidium titanyl phosphate (RTP) crystal that exhibits natural birefringence.\nSince we need to set the actually realised operation by switching on or off the external voltage, the natural birefringence has to be compensated for: This was achieved by cutting the crystal in two halves and rotate them against each other by 90$^\\circ$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=10cm]{EOM_3.png}\n\t\\caption{Schematic of the two EOM crystals; the reference frame is given by the orientation of the crystal axes and is rotated by 45$^\\circ$ with respect to $| H \\rangle$ and $| V \\rangle$: the phase $\\phi$ originating from the natural birefringence is accumulated along the $x$-axes, while the phase $\\Phi_\\mathrm{U}$ originating from the application of $\\vec{E}$ is accumulated along the $z$-axes of the crystals.}\n\\label{fig:EOM}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to obtain the desired reflection and transmission matrices, aligning the crystal to an rotation angle of 45$^\\circ$ with respect to the H- and V-axes is crucial.\nStill it is not trivial which concrete operators can be realised with this device, since even phases are significant because the interference patterns are strongly phase-sensitive.\nAs the external voltage is applied along the $z$-axes of the crystals we can derive the expression for the rotation operation of the EOM in the H-V-basis:\n\\begin{center}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 8540, "prevtext": "\nwith the time-dependent amplitudes $a_{x,c}(t) \\in \\mathbb

\n\\label{subsec:graph_implement}\nAs described above a quantum walk includes a coin operation acting on the internal degree of freedom, in our case the polarisation.\nIn the experiment the polarisation can be statically rotated in a straight-forward way by applying retardation plates. \nFor example a typical coin, implemented by a half-wave plate (HWP) at an angle of $22.5^\\circ$, is the Hadamard coin, which transforms an input comprising one polarization into a fair superposition of both polarizations. \nAnother balanced coin can be implemented by a quarter-wave plate (QWP) at an angle of $45^\\circ$ (see subsection \\ref{subsec:dyna_coin}).\nSuch devices in a loop architecture can only realise static operations, which means they are the same for all steps and positions.\n\\\\\nIntroducing a dynamical coin dramatically increases the versatility of a quantum walk as a model system: It offers new possibilities, e.g. in altering the structure of the underlying graph \\cite{elster_quantum_2015} (see also subsection \\ref{subsec:finite}) as well as in ``in-situ'' preparation of the initial state of the quantum walk (see subsection \\ref{subsec:state_prep}). \n\\\\\nA direct manipulation of the graph structure would mean to modify the step operator which carries the information on the walker's possible paths.\nSince in our setup the step operation is realised by a fixed combination of PBSs and SMFs this can obviously \\emph{not} be dynamically changed.\nHowever, the displacement direction in the step operation depends on the polarisation (see equation \\ref{eq:Step}) and the polarization can be addressed dynamically via fast switching EOMs.\nThus a clever manipulation of the polarization allows to prevent that intensity from a certain position is shifted in a certain direction (e.g. to the right), which is the same effect as breaking the respective link (in this case the right one) would have.\n\n\\\\\nWe will present here in more detail how the dynamical coin is harnessed for the implementation of a quantum walk on a finite graph:\nFigure \\ref{fig:Kaskade_Timings} shows in a Galton board-like scheme a possible evolution of the walker using two specific coin operations, the reflection and the transmission. \nA reflection operation $\\hat{R}$ (grey box) denotes a polarization switching from $| H \\rangle$ to $| V \\rangle$ and vice versa.\nLeaving the polarisations unchanged corresponds to the transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ (white box). \nIn the given example, we intend to limit the spread of the walker's external state to the positions $-1,0,1$, thus it must not evolve into the red areas. \nThis corresponds to a reflection operator at $x= -1$ for the left boundary and at $x = 1$ for the right boundary.\n\n\\\\\nThe example illustrates on the one hand that time-multiplexing techniques in combination with dynamical coin control provides a powerful tool for implementing not only dynamical coin operations but also non-trivial graph structures. \nOn the other hand, it also shows the significance of properly timed polarisation switchings, which require accurate engineering of the hardware and the software of the setup. \nThe presentation of its details will be given in the following sections.\n\n\t\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Kaskade_Timings_2.png}\n\t\\caption{Illustration of how the spread of the walker's external state is limited via polarisation switching; a reflection $\\hat{R}$ is represented by a grey box and switches the horizontal (red lines) into vertical (blue lines) polarization and vice versa. The transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ is represented by a white box leaving the polarizations unchanged. Note that in the setup the spatial position is in the experiment mapped into the time domain.}\n\t\\label{fig:Kaskade_Timings}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Implementation of dynamical coin operations via an EOM}\t \n\\label{subsec:dyna_coin}\nFor the implementation of non-trivial graphs a device is needed that switches between reflection and transmission operations $\\hat{R}$, $\\hat{T}$ and, possibly, a third mixing coin $\\hat{C}$.\nIn order to address single positions the device must exhibit a switching speed that is comparable to the position separation $\\tau_\\mathrm{Pos}$ (here: 46.5\\,ns).\n\nIn order to meet the challenging requirements on homogeneity, accuracy of rotation angle and switching speed, we thus apply an electro-optic modulator (EOM, see Figure \\ref{fig:EOM}).\nThis device operates based on the Pockels effect to manipulate the polarization of light passing through it: The refractive index of a medium is changed along the direction of an applied voltage, thus introducing or altering birefringence, which can be done at high speeds.\nThe Pockels cell used in the setup consists of a rubidium titanyl phosphate (RTP) crystal that exhibits natural birefringence.\nSince we need to set the actually realised operation by switching on or off the external voltage, the natural birefringence has to be compensated for: This was achieved by cutting the crystal in two halves and rotate them against each other by 90$^\\circ$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=10cm]{EOM_3.png}\n\t\\caption{Schematic of the two EOM crystals; the reference frame is given by the orientation of the crystal axes and is rotated by 45$^\\circ$ with respect to $| H \\rangle$ and $| V \\rangle$: the phase $\\phi$ originating from the natural birefringence is accumulated along the $x$-axes, while the phase $\\Phi_\\mathrm{U}$ originating from the application of $\\vec{E}$ is accumulated along the $z$-axes of the crystals.}\n\\label{fig:EOM}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to obtain the desired reflection and transmission matrices, aligning the crystal to an rotation angle of 45$^\\circ$ with respect to the H- and V-axes is crucial.\nStill it is not trivial which concrete operators can be realised with this device, since even phases are significant because the interference patterns are strongly phase-sensitive.\nAs the external voltage is applied along the $z$-axes of the crystals we can derive the expression for the rotation operation of the EOM in the H-V-basis:\n\\begin{center}\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{EOM}(U) &= \nR(45 ^\\circ) \\cdot \\hat{C}_\\mathrm{crystal~1}

\\label{sec:exp_imp}\n\n\\subsection{Timings} \\label{subsec:Timings}\nThe time-multiplexing scheme is based on three different time scales which have to be designed appropriately in order to guarantee the unique mapping between arrival time and step and position assignment of a pulse.\nIn addition, technical restrictions must be taken into account, e.g the dead times of the detectors, the overall measurement time and where required the switching speed for the dynamical coin. \n\nThe smallest time scale is the position separation $\\tau_\\mathrm{Pos}$ given by the runtime difference in the two fibres.\nSince the walker's wave function is distributed over more and more positions with growing step number, the roundtrip time $\\tau_\\mathrm{RT}$ must be chosen long enough to prevent the overlapping of pulses belonging to different steps up to a maximal step $m$.\nSuch an unambiguous assignment of the positions requires that the latest position of the $n$-th step has no overlap with the earliest position of the $(n+1)$-th step (see Figure \\ref{fig:Timings_Sketch}).\nSince the number of possible positions of the $m$-th step equals $m + 1$ we find the following relation between the time scales:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 21662, "prevtext": "\n\\end{center}\nwhere $R( \\pm 45 ^\\circ)$ are the rotation matrices  for the basis transform,

effect.\nIn principle all operators of this shape can be realised, just by setting an appropriate voltage to attain the needed phase $\\Phi_\\mathrm{U}$.\nHowever, this does not exhaust the full space of unitary $2\\times2$ matrices and we have to stay within this constraint when choosing coin operations.\n\nFor the modification of the graph structure we are interested in 3 special cases:\nFor

presented setup we chose fibres of lengths 145\\,m and 135\\,m, respectively.\nOn the one hand, the resulting length difference of 10\\,m leads to a position separation of $\\tau_\\mathrm{Pos} = 46.5$\\,ns matching the deadtimes of the APDs and the switching speed of the EOM of around 50\\,ns.\nOn the other hand, the spacing of the roundtrips $\\tau_\\mathrm{RT}$ is determined by the length

sec. \\ref{subsec:finite} the limited number of populated positions prevents their overlapping, thus we can achieve step numbers up to 21 while running the experiment at 50\\,kHz.\nIn both cases we get reliable statistics of the experimental data within a few minutes.\n\n\\subsection{Analysis of Photon Numbers for Reliable Detection} \\label{subsec:numbers}\n\nFor several applications of quantum walks we aim for a reliable monitoring of the walker's full time evolution and not only for a final outcome distribution.\nFor achieving this goal we have to deal with several experimental challenges, e.g. a broad power range of pulses arriving at the detectors, reduction of multi-photon contributions at the APDs and accepting higher round trip losses when sending light to the detection unit in every step.\nHence a proper analysis of power levels and photon numbers is essential.\n\nIn order to track the walker's dynamics over time, a certain proportion of the light is coupled out in every step via probabilistic outcouplers and sent to the detetion unit. \nSimilarly, the photons are initially fed into the setup via a probabilistic incoupler. \nThe proper adjustment of the initial power level as well as in- and outcoupling ratio, is critical for reliably measuring the walker's state for step numbers as high as possible: \nOn the one hand, the intrinsic properties of ``click''-detectors demands for negligible multi-photon contributions in the steps to be analyzed.\nOn the other hand, we want to conduct measurements with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for as high step numbers $n$ as possible.\nHowever, due to the loop architecture the losses, including the outcoupled portions of the light, scale exponentially with $n$ limiting the maximal observable step number (for a detailed analysis of the occuring losses see next subsection). \nConsequently, a trade-off between a sufficient SNR for higher steps and a low enough initial energy to not damage the detectors and to reduce multi-photon contributions must be found.\n\nIn the following we perform an estimation for the photon number $N_{\\mathrm{phot}, n}$ arriving at the detectors for a single coherent pulse depending on the roundtrip number $n$ (see Fig. \\ref{fig:roundtrip} a) for an illustration of the considered quantities) in order to find the optimal power levels: \nThe number of photons per incident laser pulse is given by the ratio of the initial pulse intensity before the incoupler $P_\\mathrm{L}$ to the photon energy $E_\\mathrm{phot}$ and the repetition rate $f_\\mathrm{rep}$. \nThe incoupler reflectivity $R_\\mathrm{in}$ determines the proportion of these photons are coupled into the setup.\n Here, they are subject to $n$-times (number of roundtrips) the roundtrip loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ until the outcoupler and $(n -1)$-times to the loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$ from the outcoupler to the beginning of a new roundtrip. \nEventually, the incoupler reflectivity $R_\\mathrm{in}$ gives the percentage of the remaining photons that are directed to the detectors. The factor $(n+1)^{-1}$ accounts for the number of positions the walker is split-up to in step $n$. \nWhen estimating an upper bound for the photon numbers, we assume that the power is concentrated at only one position and thus set this factor to 1.    \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nN_{\\mathrm{phot}, n}  = \\underbrace{\\frac{P_\\mathrm{L}}{E_\\mathrm{phot} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{rep}}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{photons \\ per} \\\\ \\mathrm{incident\\ laserpulse}\\end{array}} \\cdot \\underbrace{R_\\mathrm{out} \\cdot R_\\mathrm{in}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{in- \\ and} \\\\ \\mathrm{outcoupling}\\end{array}}  \\cdot \\underbrace{L_\\mathrm{RT}^n \\cdot L_\\mathrm{BS}^{n -1}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{roundtrip} \\\\ \\mathrm{losses}\\end{array}} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{(n + 1)}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{number \\ of} \\\\ \\mathrm{positions}\\end{array}}\n\\label{eq:photon_number}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIn a conservative estimation for the properties of our experiment, we consider a roundtrip loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ until the outcoupler of 0.5, a loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$ from the outcoupler to the beginning of a new roundtrip of 0.97, in- and outcoupler reflectivities $R_\\mathrm{in}$ and $R_\\mathrm{out}$ of 2\\textperthousand  ~respectively 7$\\%$, a power level $P_\\mathrm{L}$ before the incoupler of 1.67 $\\cdot 10^{-9}$\\,W, a photon energy $E_\\mathrm{phot}$ of 2.46 $\\cdot 10^{-19}$\\,Ws for a wavelength of $805$\\,nm and a repetition rate $f_\\mathrm{rep}$ of $10^5$\\,Hz. \n\nFor single-photon APDs as used in our setup, a single photon generates a current peak (''click'') that is detected and counted as the arrival of at least one photon at the APD. Afterwards, APDs exhibit a dead-time of $\\approx$ 50\\,ns \\cite{APD2014}, which is slightly above the separation of the positions of 46.5\\,ns. \nAny number of photons arriving within the dead-time-window is accounted for as just one ''click''. \nThis may lead to errors in the measured occupation probabilities if there is a significant chance that several photons arrive at the same time.\nAn estimation according to eq. (\\ref{eq:photon_number}) shows that with the given parameters the average photon number per pulse has decreased to 1.12 as early as the third roundtrip. \nConsidering that the pulses emitted by the laser exhibit a Poissonian photon number distribution, this number corresponds to a probability of 34.5 $\\%$ that multiple photons arrive at the detector simultaneously. \nIn the fifth roundtrip, this probability has decreased to 3.9$\\%$.\\\\\nAs the damage threshold of the APDs is specified with $10^5$ photons per second, there is still space for increasing the input power in order to improve the SNR for higher step numbers. \nIn our measurements it is possible to observe step numbers up to 21, while still maintaining a safety margin to the damage threshold. \nIn this case, however, considerable multi-photons contributions in early step numbers required additional measurements with lower initial power levels to obtain reliable results for these steps.\n\n \\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Roundtrip+Step_vs_losses.png}\t\n\t\\caption{Left figure: Illustration of the relevant quantities for determining $N_{\\mathrm{phot}, n}$:  The roundtrip losses $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ until the outcoupler are marked by the black line and the losses $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$ from the outcoupler to the beginning of a new roundtrip by the blue line, $R_\\mathrm{in}$ and $R_\\mathrm{out}$ mark the reflectivities of the in- respectively the outcoupler, $P_\\mathrm{L}$ is the power of the incident laser pulses.\nRight figure: The attainable step number depending on the loss factor for a roundtrip: the step numbers are given for a dynamic range of the detectors of 40 dB (blue curve), 60 dB (green curve) and 80 dB (red curve).}\n\\label{fig:roundtrip}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Reducing losses}\n\\label{sec:ReducingLosses}\nIn the previous subsection, we have described how we can balance the multi-photon contributions in the first steps and the SNR in the later steps by adjusting the input power.\nNow the focus is on loss minimization during the round trips. Figure \\ref{fig:roundtrip} shows the attainable step number depending on the loss factor for three different dynamic ranges of the detectors. We have some freedom in tuning the dynamic range of the detectors by using different initial power levels for high and low step numbers. However, we see that the dominant factor determining the step number is the loss factor. Thus, pushing the setup to a higher number of measurable steps requiring minimising the losses.\n\n \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nFor our setup with a freespace-to-fibre based design, the fibre-to-fibre coupling efficiency is the most crucial parameter in the alignment and makes up the biggest share of the overall losses. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the alignment process we minimize losses in the first place by adjusting for the best possible mode overlap. \nHowever, two fibre outcouplings are linked to two incouplings, which results in four different coupling combinations.\nAs these coupling paths are of different lengths and pass different optical components, it is not realistic to achieve completely equal and at the same time minimal losses for all four paths. \n\nAnother significant loss origin is the partially reflecting beam sampler that couples out a certain proportion of the light in each roundtrip for the read-out of the walker's time evolution. \nThe predicament concerning the power at the detectors is that a higher power directed to them and a good SNR will cause at the same time higher losses in each roundtrip. \nIn order to determine the optimal outcoupling ratio $R_\\mathrm{out}$ for which the power at the detectors is maximal in a late step, we vary this parameter numerically in eq. (\\ref{eq:photon_number}). \nFigure \\ref{fig:Out_Time}a shows the relative power at the detectors $P$ for outcoupling percentages $R_\\mathrm{out}$ of 0.02 to 0.15, a roundtrip number $n$ of 13 and values of 0.5 for $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ and of 0.97 for $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$, while normalizing $P_\\mathrm{L}$ to one. \nWe see that it is desirable to keep $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$ between 0.06 and 0.10 (considering what is technically feasible) in order to get a power level at the detectors that is close to the maximum (see grey shaded range in figure \\ref{fig:Out_Time}a).\nAs we use an outcoupler with a reflectivity of roughly 7$\\%$, we are in a region close to the maximum.\n\\\\\nThe light is coupled into the setup by a partially reflecting incoupler, also introducing losses in each roundtrip when passing through the incoupler. \nAn ideal incoupler would reflect in just enough intensity for alignment and is optimised for maximal transmission. \nAlso considering feasibility, we use an AR-coated $SiO_2$-plate. \nIt exhibits an incoupling efficiency of $0.2\\%$ and introduces only 3$\\%$ loss in a roundtrip.\n\n\nSummarizing, the adjustment of the given parameters, the initial power and the fibre-to-fibre couplings, as well as the design of optimal in- and outcoupling beam samplers allow for a good loss control in the setup and for an increase of the number of observable steps.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Outcoupling+Time_scheme.png}\n\t\\caption{Left figure: The relative power at the detectors depending on the

significant for the timings in the setup and the signals sent between them; FPGA: field-programmable gate array}\n\\label{fig:Out_Time}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Synchronisation}\n\nAs our quantum walk relies on the accurate addressing and read-out of the time-multiplexed positions, it requires a proper synchronisation between the laser pulses, the dynamically switching EOM and the detection windows of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) acting as a time-to-digital converter.\nThe synchronisation scheme is illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:Out_Time}b: A delay generator acts as the master clock, on the one hand sending a trigger signal with a given frequency to a function generator. \nThe function generator has two output channels, one connected to the laser and the other to a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and allows for adjusting an individual delay for each of them. \nOn the other hand, the delay generator delivers the signals that actually control to the application of the high voltage to the EOM's crystal.\n\\\\\nThis setup allows us to adjust the delay between the laser and the switching pattern applied to the EOM as well as the delay between the laser and the FPGA, making it possible to deliberately switch the desired pulses.\n\n\n\\section{Results} \\label{sec:results}\n\nThe capability of implementing dynamical coin operations is an essential ingredient for full dynamical control, making the optical feedback loop a highly versatile testbed.\nWith this ability we can realise dynamically changeable graph structures as reported in Ref.~\\cite{elster_quantum_2015}, to which we add here the following three new applications.\n\nFirst, we show the implementation of the specific example of a quantum walk on a finite graph, which has so far only been implemented in static waveguide arrays with a fixed number of positions for continuous-time quantum walks \\cite{meinecke_coherent_2013}.\n\nThe preparation of different input states significantly enhances the possibilities in studying the interaction of the internal degree of freedom and the output intensity distribution.\nIn addition, quantum search algorithms typically start with non-localised initial states for optimal search results \\cite{shenvi_quantum_2003, ambainis_coins_2005}. \nThus, we present, secondly, a scheme for the in-situ preparation of non-localised input states.\n\nLast, we show two experimental realisations of state transfer schemes \\cite{zhan_perfect_2014} making use of the dynamical coin operation.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum Walk on a Finite Graph} \n\\label{subsec:finite}\nThe experimental implementation of precisely timed switching operations enables us to modify the graph structure on which the quantum walk takes place. \nIn the following, we present two examples, where we limit the spread of the walker's wave function to a preset number of sites (see Figure \\ref{fig:Kaskade_Timings}), while even more complex structures are possible as well as recently demonstrated in \\cite{elster_quantum_2015}.\n\nFor an illustrative presentation of the measured results, we will employ two-dimensional chessboard diagrams with the vertical axis corresponding to the step and the horizontal axis to the position number. \nThe intensities assigned to the individual positions are colour-coded and traced out over polarization. \n\nThe error bars for all the numerical data presented in this and the following subsections in bar chart representations of single steps are obtained by conducting a Monte Carlo scan which accounts for possible variations of the coupling efficiencies by 1.5$\\%$, of the transmission coefficient of the EOM by 2$\\%$ and of the coin angle by 0.1$^{\\circ}$ as described in detail in \\cite{elster_quantum_2015}. \nThese errors are much greater than the statistical errors of the measured data and are therefore considered the relevant errors.\n\nThe distance measure (Manhattan distance) used in this article is determined by summing up the absolute values of the differences between the experimental and numerical values of the normalized occupation probabilities $P_x$ for all positions $x$ and both polarizations (H and V). \nIts possible values range from 0 to 1.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nd = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_x | P_{H,x}^{(\\mathrm{num})} - P_{H,x}^{(\\mathrm{exp})}| \n + \\sum_x | P_{V,x}^{(\\mathrm{num})} - P_{V,x}^{(\\mathrm{exp})}| \\right)\n\\label{eq:distance}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWhen presenting the data for several steps we calculated the distance for each step and present the average number for all steps under consideration.\n \nFigure \\ref{fig:inf_exp_theo} shows the experimental (left) as well as the corresponding numerical data (right) for an unrestricted walk in which $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ can be best reproduced by a QWP set to 36$^\\circ$.\nWe observe that the walker's wave function spreads over a pyramidal pattern of positions with a significant bias towards positive positions. \nThis bias is observed when --depending on the coin angle-- launching an input state in horizontal polarisation into the setup, while a vertical input state corresponds to a bias towards negative positions. \nThis phenomenon is caused by the phases of $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ (see eq. (\\ref{eq:C_EOM_T})), which introduces different phases for $| H \\rangle$ and $| V \\rangle$ (see also \\cite{kempe_quantum_2003}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_infinite_exp+theo.png}\n\t\\caption{Chessboard representation of the experimental (left) and the numerical data (right) of an unrestricted walk for a horizontally polarized input state; the mean distance between the experimental and numerical data is 0.068 per step (considering steps 1 - 20)}\n\\label{fig:inf_exp_theo}\n\\end{figure} \n\nAs pointed out in subsection \\ref{subsec:dyna_coin}, we are able to restrict the spread of the walker's wave function by turning the polarisation at the outer positions by 90$^\\circ$. \nOn the other positions, the coin operation is conducted by a static QWP (compare Figure \\ref{fig:Bloch_too_fast}). \nFor the first example given here, we show the evolution on a graph with a maximum of 6 simultaneously occupied positions, which is realised by reflections at $x = \\pm 5$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:5site_exp_theo}).\nWe observe a good overlap between the experimental and the numerical data with a mean distance of 0.086 per step (taking steps 1 - 20 into account), which confirms that the EOM's operator matrices were worked out correctly (see eq. \\ref{eq:C_EOM_U}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_5site_walk_exp+theo.png}\n\t\\caption{Chessboard representation of the experimental data (left) and the numerical data (right) of a walk on a graph with a maximum of 6 simultaneously occupied positions for a horizontally polarized input state;

the data is obtained for a walk on a graph with a maximum of 4 simultaneously occupied positions; the error bars for the numerical data are obtained by Monte Carlo scans, see text for details}\n\\label{fig:3site_step10}\n\\end{figure} \n\nThe evolution on the finite graph is reliably recorded for a quantum walk up to step 21. \nIn general, losses scale exponentially with the step number, rendering the implementation of quantum walks with high step numbers challenging. \nIn order to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio for the step numbers presented here, we take measurements with two different initial power levels: For the first measurement, we use a neutral-density-filter (ND-filter) with an optical density of 4 which allows for reliable detection in the first steps, however, we do not observe a good SNR for step numbers greater than 13. \nThus, we perform a second measurement employing a ND-filter with an optical density of 1, which results in an initial photon number that is by a factor of 1000 higher. \nIn this case, the average photon number sent to the detectors has decreased to 0.03 in step 8 (the first step to be analysed for the higher power level), while we still obtain reliable results up to step 20 (see Figure \\ref{fig:3site_20_21}). \nStep 21 is the first step in which the deviation between the experimental and the numeric data is for the first time greater than the error bars and thus determines the limit in reliably observable step numbers. \nThe data shown in Figures \\ref{fig:inf_exp_theo}, \\ref{fig:5site_exp_theo} and \\ref{fig:3site_exp_theo} is thus concatenated from ND4-measurements for step 1 to 8 or 9 and ND1-measurements for the subsequent steps. \nThese experiments are conducted with a repetition rate of 50 kHz.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_3site_walk_step_20+21_errorbars.png}\n\t\\caption{Probability distribution for the occupation of the walker's positions in step 20 (left plot) and 21 (right plot) for experimental and numerical data and both polarizations}\n\\label{fig:3site_20_21}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\\subsection{State Preparation}\t\n\\label{subsec:state_prep}\nMost quantum walk experiments including those presented in subsection \\ref{subsec:finite} are performed with localised input states. \nHowever, proposals for boson sampling in a time-multiplexing setup \\cite{motes_scalable_2014} similar to the presented system rely on initial states occupying several positions.\nQuantum search algorithms \\cite{shenvi_quantum_2003, ambainis_coins_2005} require in addition a well-defined phase relation of the different positions.\nThe ''in-situ'' state preparation, i.e. the preparation of different initial states within the quantum walk setup, guarantees phase-stable pulse trains with controlled polarization inherently exhibiting a coherent evolution.\nFull dynamical coin control yields the possibility to realise arbitrary passive optical transformations of a fixed state \\cite{reck_experimental_1994}, in turn allowing the preparation of arbitrary states.\nTwo examples of transformations accessible by the EOM used in the present setup are illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:State_Prep}, we use these schemes to prepare two states with four positions, but different polarisation with the three-state-switching scheme. Applying the coin operation $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ in the first step and the transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ in the second step (case A) results in the walker's two left positions being vertically polarized and the two right positions being horizontally polarized.\nThe full input state including all phases is then given by $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle \\equiv 1 /2 ~( - i | - 3, V \\rangle  - i | - 1,V \\rangle -| 1,H \\rangle +| 3,H \\rangle$). \n\nWhen now switching the transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ in the first step and $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ in the second (case B), the positions -3 and 1 are vertically polarized and the positions -1 and 3 horizontally polarized (input state: $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle \\equiv 1 /2 ~( - i | - 3,V \\rangle  - | - 1, H \\rangle - i | 1,V \\rangle +| 3,H \\rangle$).\n\n\t\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{State_Prep.png}\n\t\\caption{Illustration of the implementation of the states $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$ (left figure) and $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle$ (right figure) with the three-state-switching scheme for an horizontally polarised input state}\n\\label{fig:State_Prep}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:VVHH_VHVH_bar_chart} shows the initial probability distribution regarding the positions and polarizations of the these two states in a bar chart representation.\nThe slightly unequal heights of the four peaks result from the different coupling losses in the setup and is accounted for in the numerical simulation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_VVHH+VHVH_step3.png}\n\t\\caption{Bar chart representation of the experimental and numerical probabilities for the input states $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$ (left) and $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle$ (right) after their preparation (step 3)}\n\\label{fig:VVHH_VHVH_bar_chart}\n\\end{figure} \n\nFor these given input states, we observe the evolution in a balanced walk on an infinite graph (see Fig. \\ref{fig:VVHH} for $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$ and Fig. \\ref{fig:VHVH} for $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle$).\nHere, the experiments are performed with a repetition rate of 110 kHz.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_VVHH_exp+theo.png}\n\t\\caption{Chessboard representation of the experimental data (left) and the numerical data (right) of an unrestricted walk with the input state $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$.

with time-multiplexing makes our setup a highly versatile model system for various quantum walk applications: To start with, it allows for implementing a rich variety of graph structures, such as percolating graphs \\cite{elster_quantum_2015}. \nIn this work, we presented the experimental realisation of two finite graphs restricting the spread of the walker to 4 and 6 simultaneously occupied positions without changing the setup geometry. \nHere, the walker, though spread out over several positions during the walk, exhibits revival at the initial position.\\\\\nWe have demonstrated another viable application by the in-situ preparation\nof different non-localised input states. \nThis possibility allows us to study the influence of the initial polarisation on the evolution of the walker's wave function without losing coherence.\nFurthermore, it is even possibile to combine the input state preparation in the first steps with the modification of the underlying graph for the further propagation.\n\\\\\nEventually, we implemented state transfer schemes according to \\cite{zhan_perfect_2014} to two different positions with our DTQW-setup. \nWe found the full polarization density matrix of the initial state with a high fidelity at a defined receiving positions for a periodicity of either 5 or 6 steps.\n\\\\\nSummarizing, we have demonstrated the full dynamic control over the quantum walk evolution on complex graph structures.\nAs an outlook, the dimensionality of the graph can be extended to a second dimension \\cite{schreiber_2d_2012} in order to investigate non-trivial graphs in higher dimensions \\cite{kollar_percolation_2014}.\nTo further increase complexity, a full control over the input states can be established including compatible well-tailored single photon sources of non-classical states \\cite{eckstein_highly_2011, harder_optimized_2013} to study the evolution of non-classical properties on a complex dynamic graph. \nAn additional direction of enhancement is overcoming losses by amplification \\cite{regensburger_photon_2011}.\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements} \n\nJ.~N. and I.~J.\\ have been partially supported by the Czech Science foundation

of lengths 145\\,m and 135\\,m, respectively.\nOn the one hand, the resulting length difference of 10\\,m leads to a position separation of $\\tau_\\mathrm{Pos} = 46.5$\\,ns matching the deadtimes of the APDs and the switching speed of the EOM of around 50\\,ns.\nOn the other hand, the spacing of the roundtrips $\\tau_\\mathrm{RT}$ is determined by the length of the shorter fibre (plus the free space parts), which corresponds to 685\\,ns allowing for adding up 14 multiples of $\\tau_\\mathrm{Pos}$.\nThus, our setup allows for more than 13 steps only if explicit boundary conditions apply, restricting the walk to a finite number of positions.\n\nThe duration of one experimental run $\\tau_\\mathrm{Rep}$ is then given by the maximal step number times the roundtrip time.\nIn order to obtain reliable statistics for ensemble measurements, the experimental data is obtained via averaging over many runs of the experiment taking place with a repetition rate of $f_\\mathrm{Rep} = \\tau_\\mathrm{Rep}^{-1}$.\nHere, the entire duration of one experimental run of nearly 9\\,$\\mu$s allows for a repetition rate of $110$\\,kHz.\n\nFor the finite walk (see sec. \\ref{subsec:finite} the limited number of populated positions prevents their overlapping, thus we can achieve step numbers up to 21 while running the experiment at 50\\,kHz.\nIn both cases we get reliable statistics of the experimental data within a few minutes.\n\n\\subsection{Analysis of Photon Numbers for Reliable Detection} \\label{subsec:numbers}\n\nFor several applications of quantum walks we aim for a reliable monitoring of the walker's full time evolution and not only for a final outcome distribution.\nFor achieving this goal we have to deal with several experimental challenges, e.g. a broad power range of pulses arriving at the detectors, reduction of multi-photon contributions at the APDs and accepting higher round trip losses when sending light to the detection unit in every step.\nHence a proper analysis of power levels and photon numbers is essential.\n\nIn order to track the walker's dynamics over time, a certain proportion of the light is coupled out in every step via probabilistic outcouplers and sent to the detetion unit. \nSimilarly, the photons are initially fed into the setup via a probabilistic incoupler. \nThe proper adjustment of the initial power level as well as in- and outcoupling ratio, is critical for reliably measuring the walker's state for step numbers as high as possible: \nOn the one hand, the intrinsic properties of ``click''-detectors demands for negligible multi-photon contributions in the steps to be analyzed.\nOn the other hand, we want to conduct measurements with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for as high step numbers $n$ as possible.\nHowever, due to the loop architecture the losses, including the outcoupled portions of the light, scale exponentially with $n$ limiting the maximal observable step number (for a detailed analysis of the occuring losses see next subsection). \nConsequently, a trade-off between a sufficient SNR for higher steps and a low enough initial energy to not damage the detectors and to reduce multi-photon contributions must be found.\n\nIn the following we perform an estimation for the photon number $N_{\\mathrm{phot}, n}$ arriving at the detectors for a single coherent pulse depending on the roundtrip number $n$ (see Fig. \\ref{fig:roundtrip} a) for an illustration of the considered quantities) in order to find the optimal power levels: \nThe number of photons per incident laser pulse is given by the ratio of the initial pulse intensity before the incoupler $P_\\mathrm{L}$ to the photon energy $E_\\mathrm{phot}$ and the repetition rate $f_\\mathrm{rep}$. \nThe incoupler reflectivity $R_\\mathrm{in}$ determines the proportion of these photons are coupled into the setup.\n Here, they are subject to $n$-times (number of roundtrips) the roundtrip loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ until the outcoupler and $(n -1)$-times to the loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$ from the outcoupler to the beginning of a new roundtrip. \nEventually, the incoupler reflectivity $R_\\mathrm{in}$ gives the percentage of the remaining photons that are directed to the detectors. The factor $(n+1)^{-1}$ accounts for the number of positions the walker is split-up to in step $n$. \nWhen estimating an upper bound for the photon numbers, we assume that the power is concentrated at only one position and thus set this factor to 1.    \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nN_{\\mathrm{phot}, n}  = \\underbrace{\\frac{P_\\mathrm{L}}{E_\\mathrm{phot} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{rep}}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{photons \\ per} \\\\ \\mathrm{incident\\ laserpulse}\\end{array}} \\cdot \\underbrace{R_\\mathrm{out} \\cdot R_\\mathrm{in}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{in- \\ and} \\\\ \\mathrm{outcoupling}\\end{array}}  \\cdot \\underbrace{L_\\mathrm{RT}^n \\cdot L_\\mathrm{BS}^{n -1}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{roundtrip} \\\\ \\mathrm{losses}\\end{array}} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{(n + 1)}}_{\\scriptsize\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{number \\ of} \\\\ \\mathrm{positions}\\end{array}}\n\\label{eq:photon_number}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIn a conservative estimation for the properties of our experiment, we consider a roundtrip loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ until the outcoupler of 0.5, a loss factor $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$ from the outcoupler to the beginning of a new roundtrip of 0.97, in- and outcoupler reflectivities $R_\\mathrm{in}$ and $R_\\mathrm{out}$ of 2\\textperthousand  ~respectively 7$\\%$, a power level $P_\\mathrm{L}$ before the incoupler of 1.67 $\\cdot 10^{-9}$\\,W, a photon energy $E_\\mathrm{phot}$ of 2.46 $\\cdot 10^{-19}$\\,Ws for a wavelength of $805$\\,nm and a repetition rate $f_\\mathrm{rep}$ of $10^5$\\,Hz. \n\nFor single-photon APDs as used in our setup, a single photon generates a current peak (''click'') that is detected and counted as the arrival of at least one photon at the APD. Afterwards, APDs exhibit a dead-time of $\\approx$ 50\\,ns \\cite{APD2014}, which is slightly above the separation of the positions of 46.5\\,ns. \nAny number of photons arriving within the dead-time-window is accounted for as just one ''click''. \nThis may lead to errors in the measured occupation probabilities if there is a significant chance that several photons arrive at the same time.\nAn estimation according to eq. (\\ref{eq:photon_number}) shows that with the given parameters the average photon number per pulse has decreased to 1.12 as early as the third roundtrip. \nConsidering that the pulses emitted by the laser exhibit a Poissonian photon number distribution, this number corresponds to a probability of 34.5 $\\%$ that multiple photons arrive at the detector simultaneously. \nIn the fifth roundtrip, this probability has decreased to 3.9$\\%$.\\\\\nAs the damage threshold of the APDs is specified with $10^5$ photons per second, there is still space for increasing the input power in order to improve the SNR for higher step numbers. \nIn our measurements it is possible to observe step numbers up to 21, while still maintaining a safety margin to the damage threshold. \nIn this case, however, considerable multi-photons contributions in early step numbers required additional measurements with lower initial power levels to obtain reliable results for these steps.\n\n \\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Roundtrip+Step_vs_losses.png}\t\n\t\\caption{Left figure: Illustration of the relevant quantities for determining $N_{\\mathrm{phot}, n}$:  The roundtrip losses $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ until the outcoupler are marked by the black line and the losses $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$ from the outcoupler to the beginning of a new roundtrip by the blue line, $R_\\mathrm{in}$ and $R_\\mathrm{out}$ mark the reflectivities of the in- respectively the outcoupler, $P_\\mathrm{L}$ is the power of the incident laser pulses.\nRight figure: The attainable step number depending on the loss factor for a roundtrip: the step numbers are given for a dynamic range of the detectors of 40 dB (blue curve), 60 dB (green curve) and 80 dB (red curve).}\n\\label{fig:roundtrip}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Reducing losses}\n\\label{sec:ReducingLosses}\nIn the previous subsection, we have described how we can balance the multi-photon contributions in the first steps and the SNR in the later steps by adjusting the input power.\nNow the focus is on loss minimization during the round trips. Figure \\ref{fig:roundtrip} shows the attainable step number depending on the loss factor for three different dynamic ranges of the detectors. We have some freedom in tuning the dynamic range of the detectors by using different initial power levels for high and low step numbers. However, we see that the dominant factor determining the step number is the loss factor. Thus, pushing the setup to a higher number of measurable steps requiring minimising the losses.\n\n \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nFor our setup with a freespace-to-fibre based design, the fibre-to-fibre coupling efficiency is the most crucial parameter in the alignment and makes up the biggest share of the overall losses. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the alignment process we minimize losses in the first place by adjusting for the best possible mode overlap. \nHowever, two fibre outcouplings are linked to two incouplings, which results in four different coupling combinations.\nAs these coupling paths are of different lengths and pass different optical components, it is not realistic to achieve completely equal and at the same time minimal losses for all four paths. \n\nAnother significant loss origin is the partially reflecting beam sampler that couples out a certain proportion of the light in each roundtrip for the read-out of the walker's time evolution. \nThe predicament concerning the power at the detectors is that a higher power directed to them and a good SNR will cause at the same time higher losses in each roundtrip. \nIn order to determine the optimal outcoupling ratio $R_\\mathrm{out}$ for which the power at the detectors is maximal in a late step, we vary this parameter numerically in eq. (\\ref{eq:photon_number}). \nFigure \\ref{fig:Out_Time}a shows the relative power at the detectors $P$ for outcoupling percentages $R_\\mathrm{out}$ of 0.02 to 0.15, a roundtrip number $n$ of 13 and values of 0.5 for $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ and of 0.97 for $L_{\\mathrm{BS}}$, while normalizing $P_\\mathrm{L}$ to one. \nWe see that it is desirable to keep $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$ between 0.06 and 0.10 (considering what is technically feasible) in order to get a power level at the detectors that is close to the maximum (see grey shaded range in figure \\ref{fig:Out_Time}a).\nAs we use an outcoupler with a reflectivity of roughly 7$\\%$, we are in a region close to the maximum.\n\\\\\nThe light is coupled into the setup by a partially reflecting incoupler, also introducing losses in each roundtrip when passing through the incoupler. \nAn ideal incoupler would reflect in just enough intensity for alignment and is optimised for maximal transmission. \nAlso considering feasibility, we use an AR-coated $SiO_2$-plate. \nIt exhibits an incoupling efficiency of $0.2\\%$ and introduces only 3$\\%$ loss in a roundtrip.\n\n\nSummarizing, the adjustment of the given parameters, the initial power and the fibre-to-fibre couplings, as well as the design of optimal in- and outcoupling beam samplers allow for a good loss control in the setup and for an increase of the number of observable steps.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Outcoupling+Time_scheme.png}\n\t\\caption{Left figure: The relative power at the detectors depending on the

significant for the timings in the setup and the signals sent between them; FPGA: field-programmable gate array}\n\\label{fig:Out_Time}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Synchronisation}\n\nAs our quantum walk relies on the accurate addressing and read-out of the time-multiplexed positions, it requires a proper synchronisation between the laser pulses, the dynamically switching EOM and the detection windows of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) acting as a time-to-digital converter.\nThe synchronisation scheme is illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:Out_Time}b: A delay generator acts as the master clock, on the one hand sending a trigger signal with a given frequency to a function generator. \nThe function generator has two output channels, one connected to the laser and the other to a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and allows for adjusting an individual delay for each of them. \nOn the other hand, the delay generator delivers the signals that actually control to the application of the high voltage to the EOM's crystal.\n\\\\\nThis setup allows us to adjust the delay between the laser and the switching pattern applied to the EOM as well as the delay between the laser and the FPGA, making it possible to deliberately switch the desired pulses.\n\n\n\\section{Results} \\label{sec:results}\n\nThe capability of implementing dynamical coin operations is an essential ingredient for full dynamical control, making the optical feedback loop a highly versatile testbed.\nWith this ability we can realise dynamically changeable graph structures as reported in Ref.~\\cite{elster_quantum_2015}, to which we add here the following three new applications.\n\nFirst, we show the implementation of the specific example of a quantum walk on a finite graph, which has so far only been implemented in static waveguide arrays with a fixed number of positions for continuous-time quantum walks \\cite{meinecke_coherent_2013}.\n\nThe preparation of different input states significantly enhances the possibilities in studying the interaction of the internal degree of freedom and the output intensity distribution.\nIn addition, quantum search algorithms typically start with non-localised initial states for optimal search results \\cite{shenvi_quantum_2003, ambainis_coins_2005}. \nThus, we present, secondly, a scheme for the in-situ preparation of non-localised input states.\n\nLast, we show two experimental realisations of state transfer schemes \\cite{zhan_perfect_2014} making use of the dynamical coin operation.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum Walk on a Finite Graph} \n\\label{subsec:finite}\nThe experimental implementation of precisely timed switching operations enables us to modify the graph structure on which the quantum walk takes place. \nIn the following, we present two examples, where we limit the spread of the walker's wave function to a preset number of sites (see Figure \\ref{fig:Kaskade_Timings}), while even more complex structures are possible as well as recently demonstrated in \\cite{elster_quantum_2015}.\n\nFor an illustrative presentation of the measured results, we will employ two-dimensional chessboard diagrams with the vertical axis corresponding to the step and the horizontal axis to the position number. \nThe intensities assigned to the individual positions are colour-coded and traced out over polarization. \n\nThe error bars for all the numerical data presented in this and the following subsections in bar chart representations of single steps are obtained by conducting a Monte Carlo scan which accounts for possible variations of the coupling efficiencies by 1.5$\\%$, of the transmission coefficient of the EOM by 2$\\%$ and of the coin angle by 0.1$^{\\circ}$ as described in detail in \\cite{elster_quantum_2015}. \nThese errors are much greater than the statistical errors of the measured data and are therefore considered the relevant errors.\n\nThe distance measure (Manhattan distance) used in this article is determined by summing up the absolute values of the differences between the experimental and numerical values of the normalized occupation probabilities $P_x$ for all positions $x$ and both polarizations (H and V). \nIts possible values range from 0 to 1.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nd = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_x | P_{H,x}^{(\\mathrm{num})} - P_{H,x}^{(\\mathrm{exp})}| \n + \\sum_x | P_{V,x}^{(\\mathrm{num})} - P_{V,x}^{(\\mathrm{exp})}| \\right)\n\\label{eq:distance}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWhen presenting the data for several steps we calculated the distance for each step and present the average number for all steps under consideration.\n \nFigure \\ref{fig:inf_exp_theo} shows the experimental (left) as well as the corresponding numerical data (right) for an unrestricted walk in which $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ can be best reproduced by a QWP set to 36$^\\circ$.\nWe observe that the walker's wave function spreads over a pyramidal pattern of positions with a significant bias towards positive positions. \nThis bias is observed when --depending on the coin angle-- launching an input state in horizontal polarisation into the setup, while a vertical input state corresponds to a bias towards negative positions. \nThis phenomenon is caused by the phases of $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ (see eq. (\\ref{eq:C_EOM_T})), which introduces different phases for $| H \\rangle$ and $| V \\rangle$ (see also \\cite{kempe_quantum_2003}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_infinite_exp+theo.png}\n\t\\caption{Chessboard representation of the experimental (left) and the numerical data (right) of an unrestricted walk for a horizontally polarized input state;

Applying the coin operation $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ in the first step and the transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ in the second step (case A) results in the walker's two left positions being vertically polarized and the two right positions being horizontally polarized.\nThe full input state including all phases is then given by $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle \\equiv 1 /2 ~( - i | - 3, V \\rangle  - i | - 1,V \\rangle -| 1,H \\rangle +| 3,H \\rangle$). \n\nWhen now switching the transmission operation $\\hat{T}$ in the first step and $\\hat{C}_\\mathrm{QWP}$ in the second (case B), the positions -3 and 1 are vertically polarized and the positions -1 and 3 horizontally polarized (input state: $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle \\equiv 1 /2 ~( - i | - 3,V \\rangle  - | - 1, H \\rangle - i | 1,V \\rangle +| 3,H \\rangle$).\n\n\t\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{State_Prep.png}\n\t\\caption{Illustration of the implementation of the states $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$ (left figure) and $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle$ (right figure) with the three-state-switching scheme for an horizontally polarised input state}\n\\label{fig:State_Prep}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:VVHH_VHVH_bar_chart} shows the initial probability distribution regarding the positions and polarizations of the these two states in a bar chart representation.\nThe slightly unequal heights of the four peaks result from the different coupling losses in the setup and is accounted for in the numerical simulation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_VVHH+VHVH_step3.png}\n\t\\caption{Bar chart representation of the experimental and numerical probabilities for the input states $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$ (left) and $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle$ (right) after their preparation (step 3)}\n\\label{fig:VVHH_VHVH_bar_chart}\n\\end{figure} \n\nFor these given input states, we observe the evolution in a balanced walk on an infinite graph (see Fig. \\ref{fig:VVHH} for $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$ and Fig. \\ref{fig:VHVH} for $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VHVH} \\rangle$).\nHere, the experiments are performed with a repetition rate of 110 kHz.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{iH_VVHH_exp+theo.png}\n\t\\caption{Chessboard representation of the experimental data (left) and the numerical data (right) of an unrestricted walk with the input state $| \\Psi_\\mathrm{VVHH} \\rangle$.

The phase of i  introduced by the reflection operation is compensated for by applying it four times.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\t\\centering \n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{5step+6step_transfer_scheme.png}\n\t\\caption{Illustration of the implementation of the 5 step state-transfer scheme (left) and the 6 step state-transfer scheme (right).
