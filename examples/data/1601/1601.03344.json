We have previously reported thermal tuning of the buckled-dome microcavities. \\cite{Bitarafan2015b} Here samples were attached to a copper heat sink in a vacuum chamber at $\\sim$5 mTorr, and the temperature was regulated by a proportional-integral-derivative controller. Transmission spectroscopy was performed in one degree intervals, as seen in Figure 3. The peak wavelength of the fundamental mode was tracked as a function of temperature, revealing a temperature dependence of $\\Delta \\lambda/\\Delta T$ = 0.2346 $\\pm$ 0.0007 nm/K. This tunability is vital because the stochastic nature of the buckling process produces cavities of varying resonance frequencies that must be drawn into resonance with the desired atomic transition. By heating the chip of microcavities, thermal expansion increases the cavity length sufficiently to align the optical resonance with the desired $^{87}$Rb transition at 308 K. The cavity wavelength could then, in principal, be locked to an atomic transition.  One drawback of the current method of tuning is the inability to tune individual cavities, however integrating heater electrodes\\cite{Zalalutdinov2003} or electrostatic actuation\\cite{Derntl2014} would allow for individually addressable on-chip microcavities.\n\nAnother requirement of a cQED device is that it should have open-access for injection of atoms into the cavity. The buckling self-assembly process inherently produces closed cavities, but can be modified or supplemented to provide open-access. One strategy is to couple the microcavities to hollow channels by patterning narrow strips of fluorocarbon that buckle along with the domes and intersect the microcavity.  A representative, $60$ $\\mu$m wide, channel is shown in Figure 4a. This channel has a peak height of 2.7 $\\mu$m, providing access for atomic gas injection. Previous work has demonstrated that mirror spacings as narrow as 110 nm were sufficient for atom injection,  \\cite{Hood2001} and recent work has demonstrated vapor cells with critical dimensions as narrow as 30 nm. \\cite{Whittaker2015} In addition, since these hollow channels are formed by two Bragg reflectors, they can also act as optical waveguides, possibly useful for atom trapping. \n\\cite{Melnyk2015}  A second strategy for open access is to use focused ion beam (FIB) milling to remove small portions of the top Bragg reflector. Figure 4c shows an example of an access hole milled into a buckled-dome cavity.  \n\nWe found that the properties of the fundamental microcavity resonance were retained in the case of intersecting waveguides (see Figure 4b) likely because the optical mode-waist is small compared to the dome diameter. Thus, modifications of the dome periphery has minimal impact on the central part of the dome where the fundamental mode resides. However, we found that FIB milling resulted in microcavities with optical resonances that exhibit non-linear behavior (see Figure 4d), even at low input powers. This may be a result of the conductive carbon layer applied in order to avoid charging, or parasitic gallium implantation, during the FIB milling process.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{Figure4.pdf}\n\t\\caption{(a) Microscope image of a buckled-dome microcavity with a base diameter of 200 $\\mu$m intersected by a 60 $\\mu$m hollow channel.

Microcavity arrays were formed by the controlled buckling of SiO$_2$/Ta$_2$O$_5$ Bragg mirrors, and exhibit a reflectance-limited finesse of 3500 and mode volumes as small as 35$\\lambda^3$.   We show that the cavity resonance can be thermally tuned into alignment with the D2 transition of $^{87}$Rb, and outline two methods for providing atom access to the cavity.  Owing to their small mode volume and high finesse, these cavities exhibit single-atom cooperativities as high as $C_1 = 65$. A unique feature of the buckled-dome architecture is that the strong-coupling parameter $g_0/\\kappa$ is nearly independent of the cavity size. Furthermore, strong coupling should be achievable with only modest improvements in mirror reflectance, suggesting that these monolithic devices could provide a robust and scalable solution to the engineering of light-matter interfaces.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\nThe implementation of a distributed quantum network could enable a global quantum communication system,\\cite{Kimble2008,VanEnk1997} distributed quantum computation,\\cite{Cirac1997} distribution of quantum entanglement,\\cite{Duan2001} and may even provide a global time standard by embedding atomic clocks at quantum nodes.\\cite{Komar2014}  To realize these objectives, coherent control of individual quantum states, and their interactions, is required.  Since photons - the prototypical distributed qubit - exhibit no interactions with themselves in vacuum, \\cite{Chang2014} matter systems must act as intermediaries to perform quantum-state operations, \\cite{Reiserer2014} serve as quantum memories,\\cite{Lvovsky2009} and interface with quantum processors.\\cite{Petrosyan2009}\n\nNumerous systems have been investigated as quantum light-matter interfaces including phonons in optomechanical devices, \\cite{Palomaki2013,Bochmann2013} rare-earth-ion doped crystals,\\cite{Zhong2015,Saglamyurek2015} nitrogen vacancies in diamond,\\cite{Faraon2011,Li2014,Burkard2014} quantum dots,\\cite{Press2008,Greve2012} and alkali gases such as rubidium \\cite{Wilk2007,Petrosyan2009} and cesium. \\cite{Duan2003} Of particular interest are single alkali-atoms trapped within high-finesse optical cavities, in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). \\cite{Walther2006,Mabuchi2002}  Within the past decade, single atoms trapped in cavities have been used to store quantum information, \\cite{Specht2011,Nolleke2013,Kalb2015} produce on-demand single photons, \\cite{McKeever2004,Mucke2013} perform quantum gate operations, \\cite{Reiserer2013,Reiserer2014} and to implement an elementary quantum network. \\cite{Ritter2012} These works place single-atom quantum systems as a leading candidate for use in large-scale quantum networks.  \n\nAs a result, there is a strong interest in the integration of alkali atoms into robust, scalable, packaged optical cavities.\\cite{Biedermann2010,Derntl2014}  Furthermore, it is desirable for these optical cavities to have small mode volumes and be tunable to atomic transitions.\\cite{Trupke2007,Greuter2014,Flatten2015}  Here we report the development of `buckled-dome' Fabry-P\\'{e}rot microcavities designed for cQED applications, specifically on-chip coupling between single photons and single rubidium atoms.  These cavities produce high single-atom cooperativities, can be easily tuned to atomic transitions, and can facilitate open-access for incorporation of atoms.\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\t\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{Figure1.pdf}\n\t\\caption{(a) Microscope image of a buckled-dome microcavity with base diameter of 100 $\\mu$m.

Microcavities were defined by the lithographic patterning of a thin ($\\sim$15 nm) low-adhesion fluorocarbon layer, followed by the deposition of a second Bragg reflector identical to the initial reflector. Films with low loss and high compressive stress ($\\sim$200 MPa) were realized by using high target power (200 W), elevated substrate temperature ($150\\,^{\\circ}$C), and low chamber pressure (4 mTorr). \\cite{Hoffman1994} Optical constants for single films were measured using an ellipsometer. The refractive indices of SiO$_2$ and Ta$_2$O$_5$ were estimated to be 1.49 and 2.14 respectively, at a wavelength of 780 nm. At the same wavelength, extinction coefficients less than 10$^{-6}$ were estimated for both materials. The layer thicknesses were chosen such that all layers are nominally one quarter wavelength thick ($\\lambda_0$/$4n$) at the D2 transition of $^{87}$Rb ($\\lambda_0$ = 780.24 nm).\\cite{Steck2003} Using a transfer matrix formalism,\\cite{Hecht1987}  and the optical constants extracted from measurements on single films, a peak reflectance of $ 0.9991$ is predicted for the Bragg mirrors, corresponding to a reflection-limited cavity finesse of $\\mathcal{F}$ = 3500.\n\nFollowing the deposition of the top mirror, the samples were heated (400$\\,^\\circ$C) to induce a loss of adhesion between the two mirrors in the region of the fluorocarbon layer. The built-in compressive stress drives the release of the top mirror, forming a dome-like buckle. The height and exact morphology is dependent on the dome diameter.\\cite{Allen2011,Bitarafan2015}  In this work microcavities with base diameters of 100 $\\mu$m to 300 $\\mu$m, Figure 1, and peak heights of $\\delta = 2.5$ $\\mu$m to 10 $\\mu$m were studied. We describe in detail the 100 $\\mu$m diameter cavities, and show select results for larger devices.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{Figure2.pdf}\n\t\\caption{Transmission spectrum for a 100 $\\mu$m diameter buckled-dome microcavity, with an optical cavity height of 2.67 $\\mu$m.

Transmitted light was captured using a second objective lens ($100\\times$ Mitutoyo Plan APO SL) and focused onto a photodiode (ThorLabs DET36A).  A typical wavelength sweep is shown in Figure 2, revealing resonances associated with the fundamental TEM$_{00}$ mode (at 777.80 nm) and three higher-order transverse modes. A digital camera was used to verify the profiles of these Laguerre-Gaussian modes. The fundamental mode was fit to a Lorentzian, revealing linewidths of $\\kappa = 2\\pi \\times 2.7$ GHz for 300 $\\mu$m diameter cavities and $\\kappa = 2\\pi \\times 6.7$ GHz for 100 $\\mu$m diameter cavities. Using the relation \\cite{Hunger2010} $\\kappa = \\pi c/2L\\mathcal{F}$, an estimate of the finesse may be made, where the effective cavity length is $L = \\delta + 2d_p$, the geometric cavity length is $\\delta$, and the penetration depth into the mirrors \\cite{Hood2001}  is $d_p \\approx (\\lambda_0/2)(n_H-n_L)^{-1}$. For the case shown in Figure 2, this yields a finesse of $\\mathcal{F} = 3560$, in good agreement with the predicted value.\n\nThe volume of the fundamental Gaussian mode of a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity can be approximated as \\cite{Hunger2010} $V_m = (\\pi/4)w_0^2L$,  where $w_0$ is the mode waist (radius).

For comparison, cooperativities as high as $C_1 = 290$ and $51$ have been reported for fiber-based cavities\\cite{Colombe2007} and macroscopic cavities, \\cite{Sauer2004} respectively.  \n\nIn conclusion, we have developed on-chip Fabry-P\\'erot microcavities specifically for cQED applications using alkali atoms, with tunable resonance frequencies and open-access for atom inclusion. Despite only moderate atom-photon coupling ($g_0/\\kappa = 0.17$), high single-atom cooperativity ($C_1 = 65$) provides strong motivation for further investigation and optimization. The results presented in this letter were obtained with ten-period Bragg reflectors, producing reflection limited finesse cavities with $\\mathcal{F} = 3560$. Increasing the number of periods would increase reflectance, and macroscopic cavities using the same materials have reported finesses as high as $\\mathcal{F}$ = 480,000. \\cite{Hood2001} In order to achieve strong coupling ($g_0/\\kappa \\geq 1$) with our buckled-dome Fabry-P\\'erot cavities, a finesse of $\\mathcal{F} \\geq$ 21,000 would be required. This is modest compared to finesse requirements predicted for other optical cavity architectures. \\cite{Ritter2012,Hunger2010,Mabuchi1999} Furthermore, improvement of the finesse to this level would have the benefit of increasing $C_1$ as high as 420, making it among the highest cooperativity architectures available.  \n\nWe are grateful for the support of Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (Strategic Chair \\& iCiNano); the University of Alberta Faculty of Science; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Canada (RGPIN 401918 \\& EQPEG 458523); the Canada Foundation for Innovation; and the Alfred P.

Furthermore, it has been shown previously,\\cite{Allen2011} that based on elastic buckling mechanics $L \\propto D$, and to first order $R_c \\propto D$ (where $D$ is the buckled-dome diameter). Thus, Eq.~\\ref{eqn_3} predicts  ${g_0}/{\\kappa} \\propto {D}/{\\sqrt{D^2}}$.  That is, to first order the strong coupling parameter is independent of the buckled-dome diameter.  Experimentally we observe a slight increase in the strong coupling parameter with \\textit{decreasing} dome diameter, as shown in Figure 5a. This behavior is in contrast to the typical trend of an improving strong coupling parameter with \\textit{increasing} cavity length. \\cite{Hunger2010} \n\nThe ability to maintain a constant strong coupling parameter while decreasing the mode volume is important for another key figure of merit of cQED, $C_1$, known as the single-atom cooperativity, which we define following Law \\textit{et al.}\\cite{Law1997} as\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nC_1 = \\frac{g_0^2}{\\kappa\\gamma}.\n\\label{eqn_4}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"C_{1}=\\frac{g_{0}^{2}}{\\kappa\\gamma}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msubsup><mi>g</mi><mn>0</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mrow><mi>\u03ba</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
