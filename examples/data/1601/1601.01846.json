These discoveries have already challenged\nand revolutionised our theories of planet formation and dynamical evolution. Of the nearly \n2000 confirmed planets known to date, 488 of them are in multi-planet systems, including  \ntwo unusual systems with two cold gas giant planets, discovered by microlensing. The first one (OGLE-2006-BLG-109Lb,c) is a half-scale model of our solar system \\citep{2008Sci...319..927G, 2010ApJ...713..837B}. The second one, detected \nin the microlensing event OGLE-2012-BLG-0026, is composed \nof two giant planets orbiting a G-type main sequence star (\\citet{2013ApJ...762L..28H}, H2013 hereafter).\n\nH2013 identified four possible sets of system parameters as a consequence of the well known close/wide degeneracy in the lens equation. They estimated the physical parameters using a parallax constraint and a measurement of the Einstein ring radius. \nThey also noted a significant contribution of blended (unmagnified) flux to the light curve and recognized that sub-arcsecond imaging is required in order to separate the source$+$lens from possible contamination by unrelated stars. This de-blending is critical in order to properly estimate the brightness of the lens; such a measurement can then be used to refine the light curve model and decrease uncertainties on the physical parameters of the system. Here\nwe follow the approach described in detail by \\citet{2014ApJ...780...54B, 2015ApJ...808..170B}. \nWe measure the lens flux in the microlensing event OGLE-2012-BLG-0026 using Keck and Subaru and compare it to the predictions of H2013 and stellar models. We revisit the modeling of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026 including more photometric data, update estimates of the source radius, and use the new flux constraints from Keck and Subaru to draw new conclusions about the physical parameters of the system.\n\n\\section{ Detecting light from the lens star }\n\nIn most cases it is possible to detect and to study (or to put upper limits on) the host lens stars with \nhigh angular resolution observations with adaptive optics such as Keck \\citep{Sumietal2010,  2014ApJ...780...54B,\t2015ApJ...808..170B},  VLT  \\citep{2008ASPC..398..499D, 2010ApJ...711..731J, 2011A&A...529A.102B, 2012A&A...540A..78K}, Subaru \\citep{2015ApJ...809...74F}, GEMINI, MAGELLAN, and space based observations with HST \\citep{2007ApJ...660..781B, 2009ApJ...695..970D, 2015ApJ...808..169B}.\nHigh angular resolution allows us to resolve the source star from its unrelated neighbors, while the source and lens stars will generally still be blended together. Indeed, at the time of the microlensing event, the lens star must be less than $\\sim 1 $ mas away from the source. The relative proper motion being typically $\\sim 5 $ mas yr$^{-1}$, it will require several years to detect a centroid shift \nof the blended lens and source \\citep{2007ApJ...660..781B} and more than a decade to finally see  \nthe lens and the source well separated \\citep{2015ApJ...808..170B, 2015ApJ...808..169B}. \n\nFortunately, it is possible to derive strong constraints shortly after the end of the microlensing event. \nIndeed, the microlensing models  determine the H-band brightness of the source star, so it is usually possible to determine\nthe H-band brightness of the host star (lens) by subtracting the source flux from the high angular\nresolution measurement of the combined host$+$source flux. \nThis measurement can be used with a mass distance relation as in Equation 1 from \\citet{2007ApJ...660..781B},  \nand an H-band mass-luminosity relation to yield a unique solution for the host star mass. \nThis would yield the planetary mass and star-planet\nseparation in physical units because the planet-star mass ratio and the separation in\nEinstein radius units are already known from the microlensing light curve.\n\n\\subsection{Keck and Subaru Observations}\n\nThe field containing the source star OGLE-2012-BLG-0026 has been observed by the VISTA 4m telescope \nin JHK as part of the VVV survey \\citep{2010NewA...15..433M} monitoring the disk and the bulge of our galaxy. \n We developed a suite of tools using \\texttt{astropy}\\footnote{\\texttt{http://www.astropy.org}} \\citep{2013A&A...558A..33A}, \\texttt{astroML} \\citep{astroML}, \\texttt{TOPCAT} \\citep{2005ASPC..347...29T}, and the  \\texttt{AstrOmatic} programs \\texttt{SExtractor} \\citep{1996A&AS..117..393B} and \\texttt{PSFEx} \\citep{2011ASPC..442..435B}.\nWe extracted JHK images centered on the target from the ESO archive, and performed PSF photometry.\nWe performed astrometric  and photometric calibrations using the 2MASS survey \\citep{2006AJ....131.1163S}. \nThe resulting catalogs will be used to calibrate the AO data. \n\n\n\nFirst, we used the Keck-II telescope on Mauna Kea, with the NIRC2 imager and laser guide star, at medium resolution (pixel scale of 0.02 arcsec and a field of view of 20 arcsec). We obtained 5 H-band images with an exposure time of 30 seconds each \non May 6, 2012 (HJD=2456062.081), while the source star was still magnified by $A=1.76$. The individual exposures were obtained in a dithered pattern with an amplitude of 1 arcsec.\nWe observed a second epoch on July 28, 2012 (HJD=2456134.834) with the IRCS camera on Subaru while the source was amplified by  $A=1.20$.  We obtained 20 dithered exposures of 30 seconds each.\n\nThe Keck and Subaru observations were reduced with the same procedure described by \\citet{2014ApJ...780...54B}. For each data set, we correct first for the dark current and the flat-fielding using standard procedures.  Using the catalogs we generated from VVV \nimages we compute a first astrometric solution for each image. We then adopt one AO image as a reference, and build up a catalog of sources using \\texttt{SExtractor}. We refined the astrometry of the other frames using this catalog. We visually inspect the individual images, then use \\texttt{SWARP} \\citep{2010ascl.soft10068B} to stack them. Figure~1 shows H-band images from VVV, Keck, and Subaru. We identify no bright companion within the PSF of the lensing survey telescopes, suggesting that the blended light observed by OGLE is actually lined up to better than 0.1 arcsec with the source. \n\nWe measured the flux of all sources in the field using \\texttt{SExtractor} with aperture photometry. We cross-matched the VVV, Keck and Subaru catalogs and determined the zero points. We then cross identified Keck and Subaru sources to double check the consistency of the zero points. We obtained the following measurements of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026:\n$H_{\\rm Keck}=15.43 \\pm 0.05$ while the source was amplified by 1.76 and $H_{\\rm Subaru}=15.60 \\pm 0.05$ while the source was amplified by 1.20.\nThe measured FWHM are 130 mas for Keck and 170 mas for Subaru. There are no resolved blends contributing to the measured flux by the non-AO telescopes within  $\\sim$ 1 arcsec. The chance alignment of a blend with the source and lens to within the angular scale of the AO measurements is far lower than 1\\%, so we identify the origin of the blended light as the lens itself. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33,angle=-90]{fig1_small.pdf}\n\\caption{H band images centred on the source of the microlensing event OGLE 2012-BLG-0026. \nThe left insert is an H-band image obtained by the ESO VISTA 4m telescope as part of the VVV survey.

They are both 18 arcsec square images. \nAt the sub-arcsecond level, there are no bright  stars close to the source contributing significantly to the observed blended light in OGLE photometry (4 arcsec images). \nAny bright blend would have to be aligned with the source to better than 0.1 arcsec.\\label{fig1}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.45,angle=0]{fig2.pdf}\n\\caption{The top panel shows the complete photometric light curve and best-fit, two-planet model of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026.

(2015, submitted to ApJ).\nOur revised value for the angular radius is $\\rm \\theta_*=1.54 \\pm 0.10 \\ \\mu as$.  \n\n\\subsection{Modeling the photometric light curve with or without the adaptive observations constraints}\nWe follow the modeling approach described by \\citet{2010ApJ...716.1408B} and \n\\citet{2010ApJ...713..837B} for the two planet system OGLE-2006-BLG-109.\nFirst, we take the data set presented in H2013 without alteration. We then add the CTIO H band \nphotometric light curve and I band data obtained using the 0.61m B\\&C telescope in New Zealand. \nIn contrast with H2013, we also release the constraint on the \ndistance to the source $\\rm D_S$. Instead, we assume that the source is a Galactic Bulge star following\nthe distance distribution from the galactic model used by \\citet{2014ApJ...785..155B}.\nAt this stage, we do not use the constraint from the measured light of the lens in H band in the modeling. \nThere are 8 degenerate solutions, with 3 two-fold degeneracies in minimum impact parameter $\\rm u_0$ and the 2 planet separations.\nThe results of the fit are given as the first column in Table 1. We obtain a slightly larger Einstein ring radius \n$\\rm \\theta_E=0.96 \\pm 0.05~mas$ to be  compared with value derived by H2013 \nof $\\rm \\theta_E=0.91 \\pm 0.09~mas$ and a slightly larger distance to the lens and to the source, with larger error bars. \nThe parallax values of the models (A, C, D) from H2013 are slightly larger, and compatible within the error bars with the results \nreported here.  \nFor example, the model (C and D) from H2013 give  ($\\Pi_{E,N} = 0.001 \\pm 0.028$, $\\Pi_{E,E} = 0.123 \\pm 0.005$)\nand ($\\Pi_{E,N} = -0.07 \\pm 0.05$, $\\Pi_{E,E} = 0.114 \\pm 0.04$)\nto be compared with ($\\Pi_{E,N} = -0.004 \\pm 0.03$, $\\Pi_{E,E} = 0.1089 \\pm 0.04$) from our unconstrained fit MOD0.\n\nIn Figure 3, we show the mass and distance of the lens star derived by H2013 and our first model MOD0,\nwhich employs no lens brightness constraints. The MOD0 results were generated by a set Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) over all eight of the degenerate solutions. The two results differ by more than one sigma,\nbut agree on the general features: the lens star is in the disk at $\\approx$4~kpc, with mass in the range\n $\\approx$0.8--1.1 M$_\\odot$. Comparison to the theoretical stellar isochrones computed by the Padova group \n \\citep{2008A&A...484..815B} for solar metallicity and helium abundance Y=0.30 shows good consistency with a typical main-sequence \n disk star of solar metallicity and an age of $\\sim$6.4~Gyr. The 1 $\\sigma$ error extending from 4 to $\\sim$9~Gyr.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33,angle=0]{fig3.pdf}\n\n\\caption{Mass-distance relations. The H2013 solution is shown as a square, while the diamond is the first model computed in section 3.2. \nWe plot in long dash red the relation $\\rm M/M_\\odot = \\Theta_E^2 (8kpc/D_s) x / (1-x)$ for \nthe parameters from H2013 and in dash green for the parameters of our MOD0 model. \nThe measured H-band magnitude for the lens is $H_{L}=16.39  \\pm 0.08$. We assume \nthat the extinction to the lens is given by Eq.\\ 1,  and we plot the mass-distance relation for the $\\rm 1,~4,~6.4, ~10~Gyr$ isochrones from \\citet{2008A&A...484..815B}.\n\\label{fig2}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe now apply the lens brightness constraints from the Keck and Subaru images to the\nresults of our MCMC runs used for MOD0. \nWe consider two priors concerning the star formation history in the galactic disk. First a uniform star formation over 10 Gyr, \nsecondly an enhanced star formation over the 4-6 Gyr period. \nThis prior on the star formation history has no impact on the result. We report the solution as MOD1 in Table 1. \nFinally, we take the original MOD0 modeling, and apply the posterior Keck/Subaru constraints and star formation constraints to \nthis unconstrained model, i.e., to the MOD0 results from the MCMC run. The results are identical to MOD1.\nWe note that the three modeling approaches yield the same central host mass, very similar values for the \ntwo planets, and small differences in distance to the source and to the lens. All the estimates are well within the reported $1 \\sigma$ error. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Physical parameters of the two-planet system OGLE-2012-BLG-0026}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{ }\\\\\n \\hline \n\n\n \\hline\nParameter & MOD0 & MOD1 & H2013 (D)\\\\\n\\hline\n$\\rm t_E$ ~(days)  & $94.00 \\pm 0.89$ &    $94.12 \\pm 0.92$        & \\\\\n$\\rm D_L$ ~(kpc)   & $4.32   \\pm 0.43$ &      $4.019\\pm 0.38$     &  $4.08 \\pm 0.30  $ \\\\\n$\\rm D_s$~(kpc)    & $8.28   \\pm 1.44$ &       $7.39 \\pm  1.28$       & \\\\\n$\\rm x = D_L /D_S $        & $0.53 \\pm  0.047$ & $0.55  \\pm 0.05$  &\\\\\n$\\rm R_E~(AU)$            &     $ 4.12 \\pm 0.41$    &  $4.02 \\pm 0.38$   &\\\\\n$\\rm \\theta_E~(mas)$ &     $0.96 \\pm 0.048$  &  $0.98 \\pm 0.04$  &  $0.91 \\pm 0.09$ \\\\\n$\\rm M_*  (M_\\odot$)  &  $1.06    \\pm     0.05$   & $  1.06 \\pm 0.05$  &       $  0.82 \\pm 0.13$     \\\\\n$\\rm M_{\\rm p1}$ ($\\rm M_{Jup}$) &   $0.139 \\pm 0.0085$       & $0.145 \\pm 0.0082$ & $  0.11 \\pm 0.02$ \\\\\n$\\rm M_{\\rm p2}$ ($\\rm M_{Jup}$) &   $0.80 \\pm  0.07 $ & $0.86\\pm  0.06$   & $  0.68 \\pm 0.10$     \\\\\n\n\n\n$\\rm D_{\\rm p1} (AU)$  & $3.94 \\pm  0.45$ &    $4.0 \\pm 0.5$   & $3.82 \\pm 0.30 $   \\\\\n$\\rm D_{\\rm p2} (AU)$  & $4.16 \\pm  0.45$ &    $4.8 \\pm 0.7$ &  $4.63  \\pm 0.37$ \\\\\n$\\rm Mag_{ \\rm  lens}(H)$     & $16.69  \\pm 0.38$  & $16.36 \\pm 0.13$ &\\\\\n$\\rm Mag_{\\rm  lens}(I) $      & $19.23  \\pm 0.43$  & $19.00 \\pm 0.23$ &\\\\\n$\\rm Mag_{\\rm lens}(V)$     & $21.75   \\pm 0.50$ & $20.66 \\pm 0.15$  &\\\\\n\\hline\n\n \n \\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\tablecomments{We show 3 different models.

MOD1 is the best model including constraints from the AO observations and Padova isochrones with uniform prior on disk star formation history. \n$\\rm t_E$ is the Einstein ring crossing time, $\\rm D_L$  and $\\rm D_S$ the distance to the lens and to the source respectively.  $\\rm R_E$  is the Einstein \nring radius in AU, while $\\rm \\theta_E$ is in milliarcsec. The host star has a mass of $\\rm M_*$, while the two planets are of masses $\\rm M_{\\rm p1}$ and $\\rm M_{\\rm p2}$ \nwith semi major axis of $\\rm D_{\\rm p1}$  and $\\rm D_{\\rm p2}$  respectively. We provide also estimates for the V, I, H magnitudes of the lens host star.}\n \n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusion}\n\nWe revisited the microlensing event OGLE-2012-BLG-0026. We confirm the physical picture of a two-planet system of gas giants orbiting a G star. \nWe improved upon previous modeling and refined the parameters of the system by adding\nphotometric light curves that were excluded by H2013. \nThe adaptive optics observations provide further information by measuring the lens flux. \nThe result is an increased estimate of the mass of the host star, to M = $1.06 \\pm 0.05 M_\\odot$.  \nUsing the H-band apparent magnitude of the lens, the reddening to the lens, and theoretical isochrones of stellar metallicity, we find good consistency for a stellar age of $\\approx$4--6~Gyr.\nWhen using all the photometric data, this microlensing event is very well constrained. When we add the Keck and Subaru constraints to the modeling, \nor apply the constraints a posteriori, it confirms our initial model, but does not allow refinement of the physical parameters of the planets. \nThe physical parameters are now known to $\\sim 5 \\%$.  \n\nThe central star is orbited by two cold giant planets of $ \\rm  0.145 \\pm 0.008 \\,M_{\\rm Jup}$ and $ 0.86 \\pm  0.07 \\,M_{\\rm Jup}$, at projected distances \nof $4.0 \\pm 0.5\\, {\\rm AU}$  and $4.8 \\pm 0.7\\, {\\rm AU}$ respectively.  Because the true orbital radii are equal to or larger than the projected separations, \nthe planets are guaranteed to be well beyond the snow line for a G star. The inner planet of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026 is a roughly half the mass of Saturn, \nwhile the outer one is close to Jupiter. The two orbits are close. Compared to the original results, we find a more massive host star and more massive \nplanets, orbiting at slightly larger projected distances. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{fig4.pdf}\n\\caption{ Mass histogram for  planets orbiting GK dwarfs over periods in the range 5-100 days discovered by Kepler. The upper left lines show the mass function\nfor cold planets derived by \\citet{2012Natur.481..167C}. \\label{fig4}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAn inspection of  mass histograms  of hot and cold planets referenced in the {\\it Extrasolar Planets\nEncyclop{\\ae}dia}\\footnote{\\texttt{http://exoplanet.eu}, referenced in October 2015.}  suggests that there is a dip at $ \\rm \\sim  45\\, M_\\oplus=0.141 M_{\\rm Jup}$,\ncorresponding to the mass of the lower mass planet. However, this mass histogram is obtained by combining results from different methods \nwithout accounting for their detection efficiencies and biases. \n\nWe present in Fig. 4 an estimate of the Kepler-mass distribution for quiet GK dwarf planet hosts. \nWe used  the planet radius distribution from \\citet{2013ApJ...770...69P}    and the \\citet{2015arXiv150407557W}   probabilistic mass-radius distribution \nbased on the sample of transiting planets up to $\\rm \\ 8 R_\\oplus$ with radial velocity measurements.  \nThe dark grey shaded regions indicate the edges of the Mass-Radius relation being used: specifically, \nbelow $\\rm 1.7~M_\\oplus$ and above  $\\rm 60~M_\\oplus$ (where planets  $ \\rm  \\gtrsim 8 R_\\oplus$) which corresponds to \nthe upper limit of the  mass-radius sample on which the  Wolfgang et al. Mass-Radius relation was based.  \nThe pale grey region denotes the regime where incompleteness due to the small radius cut-off at $1 R_\\oplus$  in the Petigura et al. radius function could start to be significant. \nThe cyan shaded region accounts for the error bars quoted on the Petigura et al. radius distribution, containing 68\\% of the the mass-distributions obtained\nwhen we sampled from (gaussian-approximated) uncertainties on the planet occurrence in each radius bin. \nThe y-axis of the figure is normalised such that the area under the curve gives the number of planets per star (on orbits 5-100 days) within the $\\rm log(M_p)$ range chosen. \n We remark that the planet mass distribution maybe dominated by the uncertainty in the Mass - Radius distribution, which is not reflected in the error range plotted.\nWe then over plot the mass function from \\citet{2012Natur.481..167C} $\\rm dN / (dlog(a) dlog(M) = 10^{-0.62 \\pm 0.22} (M/M_{sat})^{-0.73 \\pm 0.17}$ (where $M_{sat}=95 M_\\oplus$).\n\nFirst, we recall that the microlensing mass function is restricted to planets beyond the snow line over orbits in the range 0.5-10 AU, and spanning from $5 M_\\oplus$ to $M_{\\rm Jup}$ .\nWe have a larger abundance of cold planets, which is not surprising since it focusses on planets that most likely have \nnot migrated  far from their location of formation.  Secondly, the steep slope of the microlensing mass function is coming from the statistics of \\citet{2012Natur.481..167C} combining in a single power law the two populations of  gaseous giants, and super-Earth/Mini-Neptune. The results from Kepler would be suggesting that it is probably better  to separate gaseous giants, from Super-Earth/Mini Neptunes, which will be possible with the impeding increase of microlensing detections thanks to the new ground based facilities such as  the global worldwide network of \nwide field imagers  (OGLE, MOA, WISE, UTGO, KMTNet), the K2 microlensing campaign, Euclid and WFIRST. \n\nThe physical parameters of the two planets  system  OGLE-2012-BLG-0026 are constrained to 5 \\%. Both planets are typical gaseous planets orbiting a solar like star. \nWe also have derived a constraint on its age, corresponding to the standard age of disk stars for a solar metallicity.\nGiven the absence of blends at the arcsecond scale and the fact that the lens is brighter than the source, it will be possible in the future to directly measure the metallicity with\nspectroscopy using 8m class telescopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nV.B. was supported by the CNES and the DIM ACAV, R\\'egion \\^Ile-de-France. \nV.B., J.P.B., and J.B.M.  acknowledge the support of PERSU Sorbonne Universit\\'e, the Programme National de Plan\\'etologie and the labex ESEP.\nWe are grateful to F.
