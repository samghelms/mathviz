As theoretical physicists, we generically have a theory, or a paradigm as simple as possible, but the real world is always highly sophisticated. So it is usually not sufficient for us to play only with our analytical techniques when we try to have a better understanding of  the rich world by our beautiful theory. This is how computational physics comes in the lives of theoretical physicists. AdS/CFT correspondence, as an explicit holographic implementation of quantum gravity in anti-de Sitter space, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for one to address some universal behaviors of strongly coupled many body systems, which otherwise would not be amenable to the conventional approaches.  Furthermore, applied AdS/CFT has been entering the era of {\\it Computational Holography}, where numerics plays a more and more important role in such ongoing endeavors. Implementing those well developed techniques in {\\it Numerical Relativity} is highly desirable but generically required to be geared since AdS has its own difficulties. In the course of attacking these unique difficulties, some new numerical schemes and computational techniques have also been devised. These lectures are intended as a basic introduction to the necessary numerics in applied AdS/CFT in particular for those beginning practitioners in this active field. Hopefully in the end, the readers can appreciate the significance of numerics in connecting AdS/CFT to the real world at least as we do.\n\n\n\nThe outline of these lecture notes is the following. In the next section, we shall first present a poor man's review of the current status for quantum gravity, where AdS/CFT stands out as the well formulated quantum gravity in anti-de Sitter space. Then we provide a brief introduction to applied AdS/CFT in Section \\ref{holography}, which includes what AdS/CFT is, why AdS/CFT is reliable, and how useful AdS/CFT is. In Section \\ref{numerics},  we shall present the main numerical methods for solving differential equations, which is supposed to be the central task in applied AdS/CFT. Then we take the zero temperature holographic superfluid as a concrete application of AdS/CFT with numerics in Section \\ref{casestudy}, where not only will some relevant concepts  be introduced but also some new results will be presented for the first time. We conclude these lecture notes with some remarks in the end.\n\n\\section{Quantum Gravity}\nThe very theme in physics is to unify a variety of seemingly distinct phenomena by as a few principles as possible, which can help us to build up a sense of safety while being faced up with the unknown world. This may be regarded as another contribution of the unification in physics to our society on top of its various induced technology innovations. With a series of achievements along the road to unification in physics, we now end up with the two distinct entities, namely quantum field theory and general relativity.\n\nAs we know, quantum field theory is a powerful framework for us to understand a huge range of phenomena in Nature such as high energy physics and condensed matter physics. Although the underlying philosophies are different, they share quantum field theory as their common language. In high energy physics, the philosophy is reductionism, where the goal is to figure out the UV physics for our effective low energy IR physics. The standard model for particle physics is believed to be an effective low energy theory. To see what really happens at UV, we are required to go beyond the standard model by reaching a higher energy scale. This is the reason why we built LHC in Geneva. This is also the reason why we plan to go to the Great Collider from the Great Wall in China. While in condensed matter physics, the philosophy is emergence. Actually we have a theory of everything for condensed matter physics, namely QED, or the Schrodinger equation for electrons with Coulomb interaction among them. What condensed matter physicists are concerned with is how to engineer various low temperature IR fixed points, namely various phases from such a known UV theory. Such a variety of phases gives rise to a man-made multiverse, which is actually resonant to the landscape suggested by string theory.\n\nOn the other hand, general relativity tells us that gravity is geometry. Gravity is different, so subtle is gravity. The very longstanding issue in fundamental physics is trying to reconcile general relativity with quantum field theory. People like to give a name to it, called {\\it Quantum Gravity} although we have not fully succeeded along this lane.  Here is a poor man's perspective into the current status of quantum gravity, depending on the asymptotic geometry of spacetime\\footnote{This is a poor man's perspective because we shall try our best not to touch upon string theory although it is evident that this perspective is well shaped by string theory in a direct or indirect way throughout these lecture notes.}. The reason is twofold. First, due to the existence of Planck scale $l_p=(\\frac{G\\hbar}{c^3})^\\frac{1}{d-1}$, spacetime is doomed such that one can not define local field operators in a $d+1$ dimensional gravitational theory. Instead, the observables can live only on the boundary of spacetime. Second,  it is the dependence on the asymptopia that embodies the background independence of quantum gravity.\n\n\\subsection{De Sitter space: Meta-observables}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\center{\n\\includegraphics[width=4in]{ds.png}}\n\\caption{The Penrose diagram for the global de Sitter space, where the planar de Sitter space associated with the observer located at the south pole  is given by the shaded portion.\\label{pds}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n If the spacetime is asymptotically de Sitter as\n \n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n ds^2=-dt^2+l^2\\cosh^2\\frac{t}{l} d\\Omega^2_d,\n \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"ds^{2}=-dt^{2}+l^{2}\\cosh^{2}\\frac{t}{l}d\\Omega^{2}_{d},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mi>l</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>cosh</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mfrac><mi>t</mi><mi>l</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mi>d</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00257.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith $\\chi$ the polar angle for the $d$-sphere.

Traditionally, S-Matrix is computed by the Feynman diagram techniques, where the Feynman rules come from the local Lagrangian. But the computation becomes more and more complicated when the scattering process involves either more external legs or higher loops. While in the S-Matrix program the recipe for the computation of scattering amplitude, made out of the universal properties of S-Matrix, such as Poincare or BMS symmetry, unitarity and analyticity of S-Matrix, turns out to be far more efficient. It is expected that such an ongoing S-Matrix program will lead us eventually towards a well formulated quantum gravity in asymptotically flat space.\n\n\\subsection{Anti-de Sitter space: AdS/CFT correspondence}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\center{\n\\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{ads.png}}\n\\caption{The Penrose diagram for the global anti-de Sitter space, where the conformal infinity ${\\mathscr I}$  itself can be a spacetime on which the dynamics can live.\\label{pads}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe best situation is for the spacetime which is asymptotically anti-de Sitter as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6771, "prevtext": "\nwith $\\chi$ the polar angle for the $d$-sphere.

There are two approaches towards the construction of holographic models. One is called the top-down approach, where the microscopic content of the dual boundary theory is generically known because the construction originates in string theory. The other is called the bottom-up approach, which can be regarded as kind of effective field theory with one extra dimension for the dual boundary theory.\n\nBy either approach, we can apply AdS/CFT to QCD as well as the QCD underlying quark-gluon plasma, ending up with AdS/QCD\\cite{CLMRW,GKMMN}.

Note that the bulk dynamics boils eventually down to a set of differential equations, whose solutions are generically not amenable to an analytic treatment. So one of the central tasks in applied AdS/CFT is  to find the numerical solutions to differential equations.

According to our experience with the numerics in applied AdS/CFT, it is favorable to make a code from scratch for each problem you are faced up with. In particular, the variant of spectral method, namely pseudo-spectral method turns out to be most efficient in solving differential equations along the space direction where Newton-Raphson iteration method is extensively employed if the resultant algebraic equations are non-linear. On the other hand, finite difference method such as Runge-Kutta method is usually used to deal with the dynamical evolution along the time direction.

In addition, we shall focus exclusively on the action of matter fields because the leading $Q^0$ contribution has been frozen by the above fixed background geometry.\n\n\\subsection{Variation of action, Boundary terms, and Choice of ensemble}\nThe variational principle gives rise to the equations of motion if and only if the boundary terms vanish in the variation of action. For our model, the variation of action is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\delta S&=&\\int d^{d+1}x\\sqrt{-g}[\\nabla_aF^{ab}+i(\\Phi\\overline{D^b\\Phi}-\\overline{\\Phi}D^b\\Phi)]\\delta A_b-\\int d^dx\\sqrt{-h}n_aF^{ab}\\delta A_b+ \\nonumber\\\\\n&&[(\\int d^{d+1}x\\sqrt{-g}\\overline{(D_aD^a-m^2)\\Phi}\\delta\\Phi-\\int d^dx\\sqrt{-h}n_a\\overline{D^a\\Phi}\\delta\\Phi)+C.C.].\n\n\\end{eqnarray}\nTo make the boundary terms vanish, we can fix $A_b$ and $\\Phi$ on the boundary.

So the holographic renormalization can be readily achieved by adding the boundary term $-\\int d^3x\\sqrt{-h}|\\Phi|^2$ to the original action.

As such, the perturbation fields are required to have Dirichlet boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. Then we cast the linear perturbation equations and boundary conditions into the form $\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)u= 0$ with $u$ the perturbation fields evaluated at the grid points by pseudo-spectral method. The normal modes are obtained by the condition $det[\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)]= 0$, which can be further identified by the density plot  $|\\frac{det[\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)]'}{det[\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)]}|$ with the prime the derivative with respect to $\\omega$.  We demonstrate such a density plot in Figure \\ref{densityplot}, where the hydrodynamic mode is simply the closest mode to the origin, marked in red. Besides such a frequency domain analysis of spectrum of normal modes, there is an alternative called time domain analysis, which we would like to elaborate on below. We first cast the equations of motion into the following Hamiltonian formalism\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t\\phi&=&iA_t\\phi+P,\\\\\n\\partial_tP&=&iA_tP-(z+A_x^2+i\\partial_xA_x)\\phi-2iA_x\\partial_x\\phi+\\partial_x^2\\phi-3z^2\\partial_z\\phi+(1-z^3)\\partial_z^2\\phi,\\\\\n\\partial_tA_x&=&\\Pi_x+\\partial_xA_t,\\\\\n\\partial_t\\Pi_x&=&i(\\phi\\partial_x\\bar{\\phi}-\\bar{\\phi}\\partial_x\\phi)-2A_x\\phi\\bar{\\phi}-3z^2\\partial_zA_x+(1-z^3)\\partial_z^2A_x,\\\\\n0&=&(z^3-1)\\partial_z^2A_t+3z^2\\partial_zA_t+\\partial_x\\Pi_x-i(\\bar{P}\\phi-P\\bar{\\phi}),\\\\\n\\partial_t\\partial_zA_t&=&-i(\\phi\\partial_z\\bar{\\phi}-\\bar{\\phi}\\partial_z\\phi)+\\partial_z\\partial_xA_x.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThen with the assumption that  the perturbation bulk fields take the form as $\\delta(t,z)e^{iqx}$, the perturbation equations on top of the superfluid phase is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t\\delta\\phi_r&=&-A_t\\delta\\phi_i+\\delta P_r,\\\\\n\\partial_t\\delta\\phi_i&=&\\phi_r\\delta A_t+A_t\\delta\\phi_r+\\delta P_i,\\\\\n\\partial_t\\delta P_r&=&A_t\\phi_r\\delta A_t-A_t\\delta P_i-(z+q^2)\\delta\\phi_r-3z^2\\partial_z\\delta\\phi_r+(1-z^3)\\partial_z^2\\delta\\phi_r,\\\\\n\\partial_t\\delta P_i&=&-iq\\phi_r\\delta A_x+A_t\\delta P_r-(z+q^2)\\delta\\phi_i-3z^2\\partial_z\\delta\\phi_i+(1-z^3)\\partial_z^2\\delta\\phi_i,\\\\\n\\partial_t\\delta A_x&=&\\delta\\Pi_x+iq\\delta A_t,\\\\\n\\partial_t\\delta\\Pi_x&=&2iq\\phi_r\\delta\\phi_i-2\\phi_r^2\\delta A_x-3z^2\\partial_z\\delta A_x+(1-z^3)\\partial_z^2\\delta A_x,\\\\\n0&=&(z^3-1)\\partial_z^2\\delta A_t+3z^2\\partial_z\\delta A_t+iq\\delta\\Pi_x-2\\phi_r\\delta P_i+2A_t\\phi_r\\delta\\phi_r,\\label{unique}\\\\\n\\partial_t\\partial_z\\delta A_t&=&2\\partial_z\\phi_r\\delta\\phi_i-2\\phi_r\\partial_z\\delta\\phi_i+iq\\partial_z\\delta A_x.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs before, using the source free boundary conditions for all the perturbation fields, we can obtain the temporal evolution of the perturbation fields for any given initial data by Runge-Kutta method, where $\\delta A_t$ is solved by the constraint equation (\\ref{unique}). The normal modes can then be identified by the peaks in the Fourier transformation of the evolving data. We demonstrate such a spectral plot in Figure \\ref{spectralplot}. As expected, such a time domain analysis gives rise to the same result for the locations of normal modes as that by the frequency domain analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the dispersion relation for the gapless Goldstone can be obtained and plotted in Figure \\ref{dispersion}, whereby the sound speed $v_s$ can be obtained by the fitting formula $\\omega_0=v_s q$. As shown in Figure \\ref{ss}, the sound speed increases with the chemical potential and saturate to the predicted value $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ by conformal field theory when the chemical potential is much larger than the confining scale\\cite{HKS,Yarom1,HY}, which is reasonable since it is believed that the conformality is restored in this limit.\n\n\n\n\\section{Concluding Remarks}\nLike any other unification in physics, AdS/CFT correspondence has proven to be a unique tool for one to address various universal behaviors of near-equilibrium as well as far-from-equilibrium dynamics for a variety of strongly coupled systems, which otherwise would be hard to attack. During such an application, numerical computation has been playing a more and more important role in the sense that not only can numerics leave us with some conjectures to develop an analytic proof and some patterns to have an analytic understanding but also brings us to the regime where the analytic treatment is not available at all.\n\nIn these lecture notes, we have touched only upon the very basics for the numerics in applied AdS/CFT. In addition, we work only with the probe limit in the concrete example we make use of to demonstrate how to apply AdS/CFT with numerics. The situation will become a little bit involved when the back reaction is taken into account. Regarding this, the readers are suggested to refer to \\cite{DSW} to see how to obtain the stationary inhomogeneous solutions to fully back reacted Einstein equation by Einstein-DeTurck method. On the other hand, the readers are recommended to refer to \\cite{CY} to see how to evolve the fully back reacted dynamics, where with a black hole as the initial data it turns out that the Eddington like coordinates are preferred to the Schwarzschild like coordinates.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nH.Z. would like to thank the organizers of the Eleventh International Modave Summer School on Mathematical Physics held in Modave, Belgium, September 2015, where the lectures on which these notes are based were given.
