Polarimetric measurements \ngive us the possibility to determine some parameters that cannot be \ndetermined trough traditional intensity measurements.\n\nThe first polarimetric observations of comets were made by Fran\\c{c}ois \n\\citet{Arago}, who discovered the polarised light in the Great Comet 1819 II.\n\nLater, observations of comets clarified some common characteristics of \nthe polarised light, for example that usually the plane of polarisation is \nperpendicular to the scattering plane, and that there are variation of the \npolarisation in different parts of the comet (coma, tail). Contemporary \npolarimetric observations of comets began with the work of Yngve \\citet{Ohman39,Ohman41}, \nwho observed for the first time the continuum polarisation \nin comets and the polarisation of the emission lines.\n\nMost of the recent polarimetric observations of comets have been obtained by  \nKiselev and collaborators. \\citet{CometsPolDB} has also created a database with \nmore than 2600 measurements of linear and circular polarisation for \n64 comets since 1940s. \n\nMost of the polarimetric observations of small Solar system bodies are aimed at measuring \nthe variation of the polarisation with phase angle (which actually is \n$180^\\circ - $ scattering angle) and also its dependence on wavelength.  \n\nFrom the theoretical side, many works have been carried out by Kolokolova and \ncollaborators \\citep{Kol97Ic,Kol97PSS,KolCometsII}.\n\nThe polarisation of the dust jet-like structures in the dust coma of the comet Hale--Bopp \nwas obtained for the first time by \\citet{Hadamcik97} and was discussed later on in \\citet{Hadamcik2003}.\n\nA recent review of all comets investigation can be found in the books by \\citet{SSbook} and \\cite{Kiselev2015}. \n\nComet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) was discovered by Terry Lovejoy (Thornlands, Queensland, \nAustralia) with images acquired on 2013 September 7 and 8, using his 20-cm \nreflector and a CCD camera.\n\nOther polarimetric measurements of the comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) are presented by \n\\citet{Furusho2014} (imagine polarisation with the Subaru telescope) and by \n\\citet{Rosenbush2014} (linear and circular polarimetric measurements and their modelling).\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\nComet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) was observed during a multi-instrument campaign \nwith the 2m Ritchey-Chr\\'etien-Coud\\'e (RCC) telescope of the Bulgarian \nNational Astronomical Observatory (BNAO) Rozhen from 20 Dec 2013 until 07 Jan 2014. \nBecause of the target brightness we could achieve a relatively high S/N ratio \nand obtain high accuracy of polarimetric measurements. C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) was a \nnew comet which approach to the inner Solar System for the first time and giving us an \nopportunity to investigate the pristine material from the era of the Solar System formation.\n\n\\subsection{Instrumentation} \n\nPolarimetric observations were performed with the 2-Channel-Focal-Reducer Rozhen (FoReRo2) \n\\citep{Jockers2000} attached at the Cassegrain focus of the 2m RCC telescope. In polarimetric \nmode, FoReRo2 is equipped with a Wollaston prism, placed before a dichroic beam splitter, which \nsplits the signals into two different channels, allowing us to re-construct polarimetric maps of \nextended objects in two spectral regions simultaneously, using narrow band filters. By replacing the \nfilters with two grisms, we can perform spectropolarimetric measurements. \nAn example of raw spectropolarimetric image can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{sppolimg}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{sp_pol-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n\\caption{Spectropolarimetric image of comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy).}\n\\label{sppolimg}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nImaging polarimetry was \nobtained in two dust continuum filters covering wavelength intervals clear from molecular emission \nand centred at 4430\\,\\AA\\,\\,and 6840\\,\\AA, having a passband of 35\\,\\AA, and 71\\,\\AA\\,\\,and hereafter called \nIF443 and IF684, respectively (see Fig.~\\ref{filters}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.65\\columnwidth, angle=90]{comet_sp-BC_and_RC-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n\\caption{Continuum filters transmission curves (IF443 \\& IF684) overplotted on a comet spectrum}\n\\label{filters}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy)}\n\nImaging and spectropolarimetric data were obtained on December 29 and January 3 \nrespectively, with FoReRo2.

Previous experience\nshowed that polarimetric observations with FoReRo2 were affected by\nnon-negligible and non-constant instrumental polarisation.  In an\nattempt to mitigate this problem, we decided to obtain observations at\ntwo instrument position angles, one with the principal plan of the\nWollaston prism aligned to the scattering plan (i.e., the plan defined\nby the sun, the comet and the observer) and one perpendicular to\nit. By denoting with $f^\\parallel$ and $f^\\perp$ the fluxes in the\nparallel and in the perpendicular beams, and with $k_\\parallel$ and\n$k_\\perp$ the transmission functions in the parallel and in the\nperpendicular beam of the Wollaston prism respectively, the observed quantity\nis\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\n\\hat{\\frac{Q}{I}} &=& \n\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(\\frac{f^\\parallel-f^\\perp}{f^\\parallel+f^\\perp}\\right)_{{\\rm PA}=\\phi+90^\\circ}-\n                 \\left(\\frac{f^\\parallel-f^\\perp}{f^\\parallel+f^\\perp}\\right)_{{\\rm PA}=\\phi} \\right] \\nonumber \\\\ \n                 \\nonumber \\\\ \n                  &=&\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{k_\\parallel(I+Q)-k_\\perp(I-Q)}{k_\\parallel(I+Q)+k_\\perp(I-Q)}-\n                 \\frac{k_\\parallel(I-Q)-k_\\perp(I+Q)}{k_\\parallel(I-Q)+k_\\perp(I+Q)} \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n                 \\nonumber \\\\ \n                  &=& \n                 \\frac{(k_\\parallel+k_\\perp)^2IQ-(k_\\parallel-k_\\perp)^2\\,IQ}{(k_\\parallel+k_\\perp)^2I^2-(k_\\parallel-k_\\perp)^2\\,Q^2} \\nonumber\n\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $\\phi$ is the angle is the angle between the direction Object-North Pole and the direction Object-Sun.\nIf $k_\\parallel \\simeq k_\\perp$ we obtain\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{Q}{I} \\simeq \\hat{\\frac{Q}{I}}\\;. \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{Q}{I}\\simeq\\hat{\\frac{Q}{I}}\\;.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mi>Q</mi><mi>I</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2243</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mfrac><mi>Q</mi><mi>I</mi></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></mpadded></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02701.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\bar{S}=(S_{\\lambda_{2}}-S_{\\lambda_{1}})/2$ and is usually expressed in $\\%/1000\\AA$, for each \npixel in both dust continuum images in IF443 and IF684.

Then, using the remaining \nflux from resonance fluorescence of the molecules, we calculate the \ndegree of linear polarisation following the procedure described in section~\\ref{subsec:BS} \nfor each wavelength bin.

Then, using the remaining \nflux from resonance fluorescence of the molecules, we calculate the \ndegree of linear polarisation following the procedure described in section~\\ref{subsec:BS} \nfor each wavelength bin. The result for the main C$_2$ molecular band is \npresented in Fig.~\\ref{c2pol}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{LJ_sprw-C_2-Continuum_subtracted-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n\\caption{Polarisation spectrum of the C$_2$ emission line in the coma of the comet C/2013 R1 (LoveJoy)}\n\\label{c2pol}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe average value of linear polarisation over the whole molecular band of C$_2$ \nis $6.0\\pm1.1$\\,\\%. This value is less than half that of the theoretical one, \nwhich is based on theory of anisotropic rotating oscillators. \nAlso these values are for pure gas without the presence of other species. The theory \nsays that polarisation of the fluorescence of diatomic molecules is reduced when \nforeign gases are introduced, and collisions occur, resulting a  \ndepolarisation. Therefore we conclude that this lower value of linear polarisation \nin the C$_2$ molecular band is due to collisions with other species in the comet's \ncoma. \n\nThe excitation by unidirectional natural radiation leading to linear polarisation\nof an emission line has a maximum polarisation value for a phase angle of 90$^{\\circ}$. \nThe expected variation of gas polarisation with phase angle $\\alpha$ is given by the \nexpression:\n\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{gather}\nP(\\alpha)=\\frac{P_{\\rm max}\\sin^2\\alpha}{1+P_{\\rm max}\\cos^2\\alpha} \\nonumber\n\\end{gather}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle P(\\alpha)=\\frac{P_{\\rm max}\\sin^{2}\\alpha}{1+P_{\\rm max}\\cos^{2}\\alpha}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>max</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>max</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>cos</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
