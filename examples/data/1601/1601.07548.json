\\cite{OnakaEtAl_2007}), which is dedicated to imaging and spectroscopic observations in the near- and mid-infrared wavelength regions.\nThe main purpose of the AKARI mission is to carry out an all-sky survey.\nIn addition to the all-sky survey observations, a number of pointing observations have been carried out with the IRC.\n\nThe IRC comprises three channels, each of which covers a different wavelength range:\nNIR (1.8--5.5\\,\\micron), MIR-S (4.6--13.4\\,\\micron), and MIR-L (12.6--26.5\\,\\micron).\nA prism (NP) and a grism (NG) are equipped with the NIR channel for spectroscopy.\nThe grism mode covers the 2.5--5.0\\,\\micron\\ range with a spectral resolving power ($R\\equiv\\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda$) of 120 at 3.6\\,\\micron, whereas the prism mode is 1.8--5.5\\,\\micron\\ with lower resolution of $R=19$ at 3.5\\,\\micron\\ \\citep{OhyamaEtAl_2007e}.\nThe NIR spectroscopy is one of the unique capabilities of AKARI because continuous coverage in this wavelength range cannot be achieved by ground-based telescopes owing to atmospheric absorption.\nThe Infrared Space Observatory (ISO; \\cite{KesslerEtAl_1996}) is also capable of near-infrared spectroscopy but its observations are limited to bright sources.\nThe sensitivities of ISO and AKARI are on the order of a few Jy and a few mJy, respectively.\nThe Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) onboard the Spitzer space telescope observes wavelengths longer than 5.2\\,\\micron\\ \\citep{HouckEtAl_2004}.\n\nThe IRC team has developed and distributed the IDL-based data reduction package ``IRC Spectroscopy Toolkit'' at the AKARI website\\footnote{\\texttt{http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/AKARI/Observation/support/IRC/}}.\nThe toolkit extracts a spectral image for each source after the basic data reduction (dark subtraction, linearity correction, flat fielding, stacking, etc.).\nFor each spectral image, the toolkit converts the pixel positions along the dispersion direction to wavelengths and divides the outputs by the spectral response (the output per the unit flux density at each wavelength).\nThe one-dimensional calibrated spectrum is obtained by summing up the image along the spatial axis \\citep{OhyamaEtAl_2007e}. \n\n``AKARI IRC Data User Manual for Post-Helium (Phase 3) Mission Version 1.1''\\footnote{\\S 6.9.7. \\texttt{http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/AKARI/Observation/support/IRC/IDUM/IRC\\_IDUM\\_P3\\_1.1.pdf}} states that the second-order light diffracted by the grism overlaps with the first-order light of wavelengths longer than 4.9\\,\\micron.\n\nPrevious spectral response calibrations of the grism mode performed by \\citet{OhyamaEtAl_2007e} and T. Shimonishi\\footnote{see the change log of the IRC Spectroscopy Toolkit version 20130813 and \\citet{ShimonishiEtAl_2013}} are based on observations of A- and K-type standard stars.\nThese stars have blue spectra; in other words, their fluxes are larger at shorter wavelengths.\nConsequently, the intensity of the contaminating second-order light increases relative to that of the first-order light at longer wavelengths. \nObserved signals for 4.9--5.0\\,\\micron\\ are therefore vulnerable to second-order light and, hence, the spectral response in this wavelength range produces erroneous flux values particularly for red objects, which have less contamination from the second-order light.\nPrevious flux calibrations neglected this contamination effect.\n\nThe wavelength range contaminated by the second-order light is important for some features, such as the carbon monoxide fundamental ro-vibrational absorption bands (around at 4.7\\,\\micron).\nFor instance, such absorption bands can be used to probe the physical conditions of molecular clouds surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs), as investigated by, e.g., \\citet{SpoonEtAl_2004b} and \\citet{ShirahataEtAl_2013}.\nIt is difficult to analyze the absorption from the grism mode spectra unless the contamination is corrected properly.\n\nIn this paper, we quantify and correct for the contamination of the second-order light in the IRC grism spectroscopy.\nIn section \\ref{sec. design}, the design of the NIR channel and that of the grism are described.\nWe revise the wavelength calibration of the grism mode more precisely and discuss the spectral responses from the first- and second-order light in section \\ref{sec. new_cal}.\nThe usefulness of the proposed flux calibration that corrects for the effect of the second-order light is discussed in section \\ref{sec. flux-cal}.\nFinally, we summarize the calibration results in section \\ref{sec. summary}.\n\n\n\\section{Design of the IRC NIR Channel and the Grism}\n\\label{sec. design}\n\nA grism is a prism combined with a transmission diffraction grating designed so that a ray of specific wavelength passes straight through.\nWith the help of the diffraction grating, the grism has higher spectral resolving power than the prism, but at the same time, it produces higher order interference.\nIn simple grating spectroscopy, the observing wavelength range is limited within an octave.\nAn order-sorting filter is generally used to prevent overlap between light of different orders.\nThe situation is more complex in the case of grism spectroscopy.\nThe optical path difference within a grism depends on the refractive index of its material.\nOwing to the wavelength dependence of the refractive index, the second-order light can contaminate the first-order spectrum even if the order-sorting filter works perfectly.\nWe therefore review the design of the IRC NIR channel and the grism considering this effect.\n\nAccording to the ASTRO-F interim report volume 2 \\citep{ASTRO-F_2002}, the light that enters the NIR channel is first collimated by three lenses, diffracted by the grism mounted on the filter wheel, and focused by the plano-convex camera lens on the detector array.\nFigure \\ref{fig. design_NG} shows a schematic of the NIR channel and key parameters.\n\\citet{OnakaEtAl_2007} give a more detailed layout including the fore-optics.\nThe spacing between the grism and the plano-convex lens is 27.7\\,mm.\nThis lens is 6.5-mm thick and made of silicon.\nSince the refractive index of silicon is 3.4 in the wavelength range of the grism mode \\citep{FreyEtAl_2006}, the second principal plane of the plano-convex lens is located $6.5/3.4=1.9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ in front of its rear surface.\nThe designed interval between the lens and the focal plane is 60\\,mm.\nNote that the actual in-flight interval between them may not be equal to this value because the focal position is optimized for low-temperature operation by slightly rearranging the optical elements.\nThe report does not provide the in-flight value.\nThus, we assume the design value of 60\\,mm for the interval as a first approximation.\n\nIR light of wavelength $\\lambda$ interferes constructively with the grism if the emitting angle $\\theta$ satisfies\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  m \\lambda = d \\left[ n \\sin\\alpha -

(in preparation) for the data reduction and the error estimate.\nOne of the reduced spectra is shown in figure \\ref{fig. spec_NGC6543}.\nWe fit a Gaussian on a linear continuum to each recombination line excepting H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\beta$ and H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\varepsilon$.\nH\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\beta$ is fitted together with its immediate neighbor [K\\emissiontype{III}] by two Gaussians on a linear continuum.\nSimilarly, H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\varepsilon$ is fitted with He\\emissiontype{II} 7--6.\nThe fitted central wavelengths $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ are tabulated in table \\ref{tab. lines} with theoretical values $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ taken from the ISO line list\\footnote{\\texttt{http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/ISO/linelists/Hydrogenic.html}}.\nThe difference between $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ relative to $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ corresponds to velocity of 450\\,km\\,s${}^{-1}$ on average.\nThe velocity of NGC 6543 relative to the local standard of rest is $V_\\mathrm{LSR}=-51\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$  \\citep{SchneiderEtAl_1983}.\nThe Doppler shift arising from $V_\\mathrm{LSR}$ is smaller than the difference between $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ by an order of magnitude.\nFor the two observations, the orbital velocity of the satellite projected to the line-of-sight is 0.7\\,km\\,s${}^{-1}$.\nThe Doppler shift by the satellite's motion is also smaller than the difference $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}-\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ by a few orders of magnitude.\nWe here ignore any Doppler effects.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./figure_03.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{2.5--5.0\\,\\micron\\ spectra of NGC 6543 observed in the grism mode (observation ID: 5020047.1).}\n  \\label{fig. spec_NGC6543}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table}\n  \\tbl{Fitted recombination lines.}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n      \\hline\n      line                              & $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ (\\micron)\\footnotemark[$*$] \n                                                  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{$\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ (\\micron)\\footnotemark[$\\dagger$]} \\\\\n                                                  \\cline{3-4}\n                                        &         & 5020047.1            & 5020048.1                      \\\\\n      \\hline\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Br$\\beta$       & 2.62587 & $2.62629\\pm 0.00087$ & $2.62559\\pm 0.00044$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\varepsilon$ & 3.03920 & $3.04600\\pm 0.00059$ & $3.04581\\pm 0.00049$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\delta$      & 3.29699 & $3.30523\\pm 0.00054$ & $3.30501\\pm 0.00065$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\gamma$      & 3.74056 & $3.74909\\pm 0.00066$ & $3.74914\\pm 0.00049$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Br$\\alpha$      & 4.05226 & $4.05811\\pm 0.00035$ & $4.05823\\pm 0.00045$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\beta$       & 4.65378 & $4.65898\\pm 0.00067$ & $4.65886\\pm 0.00086$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n  }\n  \\label{tab. lines}\n  \\begin{tabnote}\n    \\footnotemark[$*$] The theoretical wavelength of each line taken from the ISO line list.\\\\\n    \\footnotemark[$\\dagger$] The wavelength of each line in the spectra is processed using the toolkit (figure \\ref{fig. spec_NGC6543}).\n  \\end{tabnote}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe differences between $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ can be explained by the wavelength dependence of $n(\\lambda)$.\nFrom equations (\\ref{eq. interfere}), (\\ref{eq.

(in preparation) for the data reduction and the error estimate.\nOne of the reduced spectra is shown in figure \\ref{fig. spec_NGC6543}.\nWe fit a Gaussian on a linear continuum to each recombination line excepting H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\beta$ and H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\varepsilon$.\nH\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\beta$ is fitted together with its immediate neighbor [K\\emissiontype{III}] by two Gaussians on a linear continuum.\nSimilarly, H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\varepsilon$ is fitted with He\\emissiontype{II} 7--6.\nThe fitted central wavelengths $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ are tabulated in table \\ref{tab. lines} with theoretical values $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ taken from the ISO line list\\footnote{\\texttt{http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/ISO/linelists/Hydrogenic.html}}.\nThe difference between $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ relative to $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ corresponds to velocity of 450\\,km\\,s${}^{-1}$ on average.\nThe velocity of NGC 6543 relative to the local standard of rest is $V_\\mathrm{LSR}=-51\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$  \\citep{SchneiderEtAl_1983}.\nThe Doppler shift arising from $V_\\mathrm{LSR}$ is smaller than the difference between $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ by an order of magnitude.\nFor the two observations, the orbital velocity of the satellite projected to the line-of-sight is 0.7\\,km\\,s${}^{-1}$.\nThe Doppler shift by the satellite's motion is also smaller than the difference $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}-\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ by a few orders of magnitude.\nWe here ignore any Doppler effects.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./figure_03.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{2.5--5.0\\,\\micron\\ spectra of NGC 6543 observed in the grism mode (observation ID: 5020047.1).}\n  \\label{fig. spec_NGC6543}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table}\n  \\tbl{Fitted recombination lines.}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n      \\hline\n      line                              & $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ (\\micron)\\footnotemark[$*$] \n                                                  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{$\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ (\\micron)\\footnotemark[$\\dagger$]} \\\\\n                                                  \\cline{3-4}\n                                        &         & 5020047.1            & 5020048.1                      \\\\\n      \\hline\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Br$\\beta$       & 2.62587 & $2.62629\\pm 0.00087$ & $2.62559\\pm 0.00044$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\varepsilon$ & 3.03920 & $3.04600\\pm 0.00059$ & $3.04581\\pm 0.00049$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\delta$      & 3.29699 & $3.30523\\pm 0.00054$ & $3.30501\\pm 0.00065$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\gamma$      & 3.74056 & $3.74909\\pm 0.00066$ & $3.74914\\pm 0.00049$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Br$\\alpha$      & 4.05226 & $4.05811\\pm 0.00035$ & $4.05823\\pm 0.00045$ \\\\\n      H\\emissiontype{I} Pf$\\beta$       & 4.65378 & $4.65898\\pm 0.00067$ & $4.65886\\pm 0.00086$ \\\\\n      \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n  }\n  \\label{tab. lines}\n  \\begin{tabnote}\n    \\footnotemark[$*$] The theoretical wavelength of each line taken from the ISO line list.\\\\\n    \\footnotemark[$\\dagger$] The wavelength of each line in the spectra is processed using the toolkit (figure \\ref{fig. spec_NGC6543}).\n  \\end{tabnote}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe differences between $\\lambda_\\mathrm{tool}$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{true}$ can be explained by the wavelength dependence of $n(\\lambda)$.\nFrom equations (\\ref{eq. interfere}), (\\ref{eq.

The spectrum processed with the toolkit is also shown.}\n  \\label{fig. demo_red}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs another example, figure \\ref{fig. demo_blue} shows the result for an A0V star (HD 40624), which has a blue spectrum.\nIn this case, the first-order spectrum at longer wavelengths is assumed to be largely contaminated by the second-order light that comes from shorter wavelengths.\nThis star was also observed in the prism mode just before the grism mode observation.\nSince the prism is not a grating element, any problems associated with the higher order light cannot occur in the prism mode.\nThe flux calibration results basically agree with the prism mode spectrum but disagree with it if the off-diagonal elements of the response matrix, which measure the contribution of the second-order light, are ignored.\nThis suggests that our flux calibration successfully removes the second-order component.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./figure_11.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{Demonstration of the matrix-formulated calibration for an A0V star, HD 40624 (observation ID: 5124038.1).

The prism mode spectrum in the 1.8--3.0\\,\\micron\\ range was not obtained owing to the saturation of the detector.}\n  \\label{fig. demo_blue}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe toolkit has not been able to correct the second-order light contamination of the first-order spectra in wavelengths longer than 4.9\\,\\micron.\nThis biases the flux calibration, especially for red objects, and prevents obtaining accurate spectra in this wavelength range.\nThe new flux calibration, which quantifies and subtracts the contamination, can resolve this problem for a wide range of objects, as shown by the above examples.\nNow we can accurately obtain the 4.9--5.0\\,\\micron\\ spectra without the effect of the second-order light.\nThis allows the study of the spectral features of red objects that appear in this wavelength range, such as the carbon monoxide absorption within nearby AGNs from the AKARI grism mode spectroscopic observations.\n\\citet{ImanishiEtAl_2008c} reported that three ULIRGs observed in Phases 1 and 2 by the grism mode show the CO absorption feature.\nHowever, these absorption spectra are significantly affected by the second-order contamination and have never been analyzed to date. \nMoreover, OCS ice absorption (4.9\\,\\micron) falls into the extended wavelength range \\citep{BoogertEtAl_2015}.\nThe OCS ice can be used to study the evolution of circumstellar disks of young stellar objects.\nFor instance, \\citet{AikawaEtAl_2012} tentatively detected the OCS ice absorption toward a low-mass young stellar object IRC-L1041-2 from the grism mode observation.\nTo study this feature in young stellar objects, the effect of the contamination needs to be corrected.\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\\label{sec. summary}\n\nIn this paper, we revise the calibrations of the AKARI IRC grism mode spectroscopy by subtracting the second-order light that contaminates the first-order spectrum.\nFirst, the refractive index of Ge, the material of which the grism is made, is taken as a function of the wavelength.\nThe difference from the previous linear wavelength calibration is measured from the recombination lines of planetary nebulae, and we successfully explain it by the wavelength dependence of the refractive index.\nNext, the spectral responses from the first- and second-order light are simultaneously obtained with standard objects that show contrastive red and blue spectra.\nWith these new responses, the first- and second-order light mixing in 4.9--5.0\\,\\micron\\ are decomposed for the first time.\nFinally, the flux calibration with the set of the responses is formulated into a matrix form.\nThis flux calibration demonstrates and succeeds in removing the second-order-light component in both red and blue objects.\nThe new calibrations enable us to obtain correct 4.9--5.0\\,\\micron\\ spectra from grism mode observations and are useful in studies of, for example, the carbon monoxide absorption within nearby AGNs.\nNote that the calibrations presented here are limited to the observations before the exhaustion of liquid helium (Phases 1 and 2).\nDuring the post-helium phase (Phase 3), the temperature of the detector exceeds 40\\,K, and hence, the operating conditions in Phase 3 largely differ from those in Phases 1 and 2.\nSimilar calibrations for Phase 3 will be presented in forthcoming papers.\n\n\n\\begin{ack}\nAKARI is a JAXA project with

The spectrum processed with the toolkit is also shown.}\n  \\label{fig. demo_red}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs another example, figure \\ref{fig. demo_blue} shows the result for an A0V star (HD 40624), which has a blue spectrum.\nIn this case, the first-order spectrum at longer wavelengths is assumed to be largely contaminated by the second-order light that comes from shorter wavelengths.\nThis star was also observed in the prism mode just before the grism mode observation.\nSince the prism is not a grating element, any problems associated with the higher order light cannot occur in the prism mode.\nThe flux calibration results basically agree with the prism mode spectrum but disagree with it if the off-diagonal elements of the response matrix, which measure the contribution of the second-order light, are ignored.\nThis suggests that our flux calibration successfully removes the second-order component.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./figure_11.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{Demonstration of the matrix-formulated calibration for an A0V star, HD 40624 (observation ID: 5124038.1). The spectrum calculated with only the diagonal elements of the response matrix is also shown. The magenta points show the spectrum obtained in the prism mode observation of IRC.  The prism mode spectrum in the 1.8--3.0\\,\\micron\\ range was not obtained owing to the saturation of the detector.}\n  \\label{fig. demo_blue}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe toolkit has not been able to correct the second-order light contamination of the first-order spectra in wavelengths longer than 4.9\\,\\micron.\nThis biases the flux calibration, especially for red objects, and prevents obtaining accurate spectra in this wavelength range.\nThe new flux calibration, which quantifies and subtracts the contamination, can resolve this problem for a wide range of objects, as shown by the above examples.\nNow we can accurately obtain the 4.9--5.0\\,\\micron\\ spectra without the effect of the second-order light.\nThis allows the study of the spectral features of red objects that appear in this wavelength range, such as the carbon monoxide absorption within nearby AGNs from the AKARI grism mode spectroscopic observations.\n\\citet{ImanishiEtAl_2008c} reported that three ULIRGs observed in Phases 1 and 2 by the grism mode show the CO absorption feature.\nHowever, these absorption spectra are significantly affected by the second-order contamination and have never been analyzed to date. \nMoreover, OCS ice absorption (4.9\\,\\micron) falls into the extended wavelength range \\citep{BoogertEtAl_2015}.\nThe OCS ice can be used to study the evolution of circumstellar disks of young stellar objects.\nFor instance, \\citet{AikawaEtAl_2012} tentatively detected the OCS ice absorption toward a low-mass young stellar object IRC-L1041-2 from the grism mode observation.\nTo study this feature in young stellar objects, the effect of the contamination needs to be corrected.\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\\label{sec. summary}\n\nIn this paper, we revise the calibrations of the AKARI IRC grism mode spectroscopy by subtracting the second-order light that contaminates the first-order spectrum.\nFirst, the refractive index of Ge, the material of which the grism is made, is taken as a function of the wavelength.\nThe difference from the previous linear wavelength calibration is measured from the recombination lines of planetary nebulae, and we successfully explain it by the wavelength dependence of the refractive index.\nNext, the spectral responses from the first- and second-order light are simultaneously obtained with standard objects that show contrastive red and blue spectra.\nWith these new responses, the first- and second-order light mixing in 4.9--5.0\\,\\micron\\ are decomposed for the first time.\nFinally, the flux calibration with the set of the responses is formulated into a matrix form.\nThis flux calibration demonstrates and succeeds in removing the second-order-light component in both red and blue objects.\nThe new calibrations enable us to obtain correct 4.9--5.0\\,\\micron\\ spectra from grism mode observations and are useful in studies of, for example, the carbon monoxide absorption within nearby AGNs.\nNote that the calibrations presented here are limited to the observations before the exhaustion of liquid helium (Phases 1 and 2).\nDuring the post-helium phase (Phase 3), the temperature of the detector exceeds 40\\,K, and hence, the operating conditions in Phase 3 largely differ from those in Phases 1 and 2.\nSimilar calibrations for Phase 3 will be presented in forthcoming papers.\n\n\n\\begin{ack}\nAKARI is a JAXA project with
