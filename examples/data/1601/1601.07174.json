A possible lower limit on the pulsar velocity can be estimated from the lack of resolved extended emission ahead of the pulsar. \nIf there is a (quasi-)isotropic component of the pulsar wind, it should produce a bullet-like termination shock with the apex (bullet head) distance $r_s = (\\dot{E}/4\\pi c\\rho v^2)^{1/2}$.  For $\\sin i=1$, the upper limit on the angular apex distance of $1\\farcs0$ (see Section 3.1.1) implies $r_s <5.7\\times10^{16}(d/3.8~{\\rm kpc})$ cm, $p_{\\rm amb} = \\rho_{\\rm J1509}v_{\\rm J1509}^{2}>4.2\\times10^{-10}(d/3.8~{\\rm kpc})^{-2}$ dyn cm$^{-2}$, and $v_{\\rm J1509}\\gtrsim160 n^{-1/2}(d/3.8~{\\rm kpc})^{-1}$ km s$^{-1}$, where $n=\\rho/m_{p}$ is the ISM number density.\n\nDespite the morphological similarities, there are also notable differences between the two PWNe. The spectra of the lateral tails are much softer in the J1509 CN than in the Geminga PWN ($\\Gamma=1.8\\pm0.1$ vs.\\ $\\Gamma=0.7$--$1.1$, respectively), while the lateral tails' luminosity, $L_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV} = (7.5\\pm 0.5)\\times 10^{31} (d/3.8\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ for J1509, is a factor of  $\\sim200$ higher\\footnote{The photon indices and luminosity of Geminga's lateral tails are based on recent deep {\\sl Chandra} ACIS observations (Posselt et al., in prep.)}.\nThe higher luminosity could be attributed to the larger $\\dot{E}$, but the radiative X-ray efficiency for J1509's lateral tails is also significantly higher: $\\eta_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV} \\equiv L_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV}/\\dot{E}\\simeq1.5\\times10^{-4}(d/3.8\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ for J1509 vs.\\ $1.2\\times 10^{-5} (d/0.25\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ for Geminga. \nAnother difference is that there is a clear presence of faint diffuse emission between the lateral tails (beyond the extent of the shorter axial tail) in the J1509 CN (see the inset in Figure \\ref{image-raw}), while it was not detected in the Geminga PWN (Posselt et al., in prep.; Pavlov et al.\\ 2010).\n\nNumerical simulations of the synchrotron brightness distributions from PWNe of supersonically moving pulsars with isotropic wind ejection (Bucciantini et al.\\ 2005) predict filled structures with the brightness reaching its maximum ahead of the moving pulsar and gradually decreasing behind the pulsar (see Figures 4 and 5 in Bucciantini et al.\\ 2005).  \nThese simulated synchrotron brightness maps do not resemble the observed structures of the CNe around J1509 and Geminga.  One reason could be that the magnetic field structure is substantially different from that assumed in the simulations.  Bucciantini et al.\\ (2005) mention that the magnetic field may be compressed in narrow layers near the contact discontinuity surface, which, in principle, could produce limb-brightened structures, depending on the amount of Doppler boosting (caused by a high bulk flow velocity) and the magnetic field geometry.\nAnother reason could be that the assumption of isotropic wind injection used in the simulations is not valid for real pulsars.  For instance, one could interpret the lateral tails as jets or an equatorial outflow bent back by the ram pressure. However, at least the jet interpretation looks unrealistic as it requires stretching some of the parameters to their extremities. \nIndeed, a jet produced by a moving pulsar bends because the jet flow acquires a momentum from the ambient medium; it becomes comparable to the original jet flow momentum over the bending length scale (curvature radius)\\footnote{This estimate neglects possible entrainment of the ambient medium into the jet.} $l_b\\sim\\xi_j\\dot{E}/(c r_j \\rho v^2 \\sin\\alpha)$, where $\\xi_j<1$ is the fraction of the spin-down power $\\dot{E}$ that goes into the jet, $r_j$ is the jet radius, and $\\alpha$  is the angle between the initial jet direction and the pulsar's velocity.\nFor J1509, we obtain $l_b\\sim 2 \\times10^{17}\\xi_j (r_j/5.7\\times10^{16} {\\rm cm})^{-1} n^{-1} (\\sin \\alpha)^{-1} (v_{\\rm J1509}/300\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1})^{-2}$~cm.  Therefore, for a jet with the angular width $\\delta_j\\sim1''$, a significant bending on a scale of the observed curvature radius $\\delta_c\\sim 1''$--$2''$ (see Section 3.1.1) implies that most of the spin-down power goes into the two jets. However, observations of PWNe with both jet and equatorial components suggest $\\xi_j \\ll1$ (e.g., Kargaltsev \\& Pavlov 2008; Pavlov et al.\\ 2003). \nTherefore, the jet interpretation of the lateral tails would imply that in some pulsars jets can be more powerful than equatorial outflows.  More extensive modeling and simulations are needed to see whether it is possible to reproduce the observed CN morphologies for other assumptions on the angular distribution of the pulsar wind injection.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\epsscale{1.1}\n\\plotone{f13.png}\n\\caption{{\\sl Chandra\\ } images of PWNe with prominent tails.  {\\sl Top left:} J1747--2958 (the Mouse; Kargaltsev et al.\\ in prep.), {\\sl top center:} Geminga (Posselt et al., in prep.), {\\sl top right:} J1741--2054 (Auchettl et al.\\ 2015), {\\sl bottom left:} B0355+54 (Klingler et al., in prep), {\\sl bottom center:} J0357+3205 (De Luca et al.\\ 2013), {\\sl bottom right:} J1509--5850 (this paper).}\n\\label{bowshocks}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe also note that the morphologies of the Geminga and J1509 CNe are markedly different from those of other bow-shock PWNe.  In particular, others exhibit a CN with a local minimum in brightness in the pulsar vicinity (i.e., behind the pulsar; PWNe of PSRs J0357+3205 and J1101--6101), or exhibit a filled CN morphology (PWNe of PSRs J1747--2958, J1741--2054, and B0355+54). \nThe differences, however, are not limited to X-ray morphologies only.  For instance, the radio counterparts of the PWNe associated with PSRs J1509--5850 (Ng et al.\\ 2010), J1101--6101 (Pavan et al.\\ 2014), and J1747--2958 (the Mouse; Yusef-Zadeh \\& Gaensler  2005), the radio brightness distributions are also quite different.  While the radio brightness in the Mouse is maximal near the pulsar (similar to X-rays; Gaensler et al.\\ 2004), in the other two PWNe the radio brightness is low near the pulsar and becomes higher further away (see Figure \\ref{image-radio}).  \nWe also note that the X-ray morphologies of most of the other CNe in Figure \\ref{bowshocks} do not bear much resemblance to the simulated images, except perhaps for the Mouse and J1741--2054.  Ng et al.\\ (2010) mentioned an open cluster, Ruprecht 112 (C1453--623; Alter et al.\\ 1970), about 4$^{\\circ}$ southwest of the current pulsar position, as a possible birth place of the pulsar.  \nAt the distance of 3.8 kpc and the pulsar's spin-down age of 150 kyr, the required pulsar velocity would be $\\sim1700$ km s$^{-1}$, much higher than the upper limit of 640 km s$^{-1}$ on the transverse velocity inferred from the lack of detectable change of the pulsar position in 14 years.\nBased on the comparison of the older X-ray image with the shape of the termination shock ``bullet'' seen in numerical simulations, K+08 suggested that the pulsar velocity should be  $\\sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$, which is still within the allowed velocity range (see above).  However, since the deeper X-ray images reveal substantial differences between the CN structure and the simulations, this velocity estimate should be taken with caution.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Large-scale PWN Structure}\nThe most puzzling new feature of the J1509 PWN is the large-scale northern outflow seen up to $\\sim 7'$ almost ahead of the pulsar.  One could assume that the northern outflow is a powerful relativistic jet piercing the bow shock near the pulsar.  The lack of a counter-jet could be explained by Doppler boosting, but there are other problems with the jet interpretation.\nAccording to the estimates in Section 4.1.1, the bending length for a jet is very small, even at $\\xi_j\\sim 1$ and $\\sin\\alpha\\sim 0.5$, compared to the length of the northern outflow that shows no bending.  It is also difficult to explain the relative faintness of the northern outflow closer to the pulsar \n(but outside the CN) in the jet scenario.  Finally, the X-ray radiation efficiency of the northern outflow, $\\eta_{0.5-8\\, keV}\\sim 0.8\\times 10^{-3}$, substantially exceeds the efficiencies of jets of younger PWNe with clear torus-jet morphology.  Therefore, we discard the jet interpretation for the northern outflow.\n\nSimilar arguments have led Bandiera (2008) to conclude that the extended X-ray feature accompanying the Guitar nebula (which also exhibits a large-scale outflow misaligned with the pulsar motion direction; see Figure \\ref{image-guitar} and Johnson \\& Wang 2010) cannot be interpreted as a hydrodynamical jet.  Following Bandiera (2008), we consider a scenario in which particles with the highest energies leak from the termination shock apex into the ISM, and travel along the ordered ISM magnetic field.\nBandiera (2008) suggested that the length of the Guitar PWN feature, $\\sim 1.4$ pc, is on the order of the radiation length (i.e., the distance over which particles lose a substantial fraction of their energy to synchrotron radiation).  However, this assumption implies a propagation speed of only a few thousands km s$^{-1}$, instead of the speed of light, as expected for particles with large (bulk) Lorentz factors.     \nBandiera (2008) argued that the turbulent component of the magnetic field would provide a scattering mechanism and slow down particle propagation (which can then be considered as diffusion) along the ISM magnetic field to the required non-relativistic speed.  The observed hint of softening of the X-ray spectrum in J1509's northern outflow can be considered as supporting this scenario.  \nA problem with this scenario is that in all three cases with prominent misaligned (with respect to pulsar motion) X-ray features (the Guitar, J1509, and J1101--6101), the features appear to be one-sided or show very faint ``counter-features'', which means that there is a preferred direction for the escape of the high-energy particles. The cause of this asymmetry is currently unclear. \nOn the other hand, since the particles escaping from the termination shock apex into the ISM must be the most energetic ones (those with large gyration radii; see Bandiera 2008), the lack of radio synchrotron emission can be naturally explained by the deficit of lower energy particles.\n\nThe southern outflow is aligned with the CN symmetry axis and clearly represents a continuation of the CN (see Figure \\ref{image-mid-scale}).  Therefore, we can assume that at least the brighter part of the southern outflow can be interpreted as a tail filled with the shocked pulsar wind confined by the ram pressure.\nThe lack of evidence for synchrotron burn-off in the X-ray spectra suggests a high flow speed and/or a low magnetic field.  Alternatively, there could be some ``reheating'' due to in-situ conversion of magnetic field energy into particle energy, e.g., via turbulent processes and accompanying reconnection, which might explain the hint of spectral hardening at large distances from the pulsar (see Figure \\ref{image-gamma-fn-dist}.)  \nIndeed, Ng et al.\\ (2010) reported the presence of substantial turbulent magnetic field components in the tail using radio polarimetry data.  \n\nThere are, however, some puzzling aspects associated with the southern outflow.  One is that the radio emission brightens with distance from the pulsar and becomes broader than the X-ray emission beyond $\\approx 3'$ (see Figure \\ref{image-radio}).  Such behavior could possibly be caused by entrainment of ambient matter (see also Morlino et al.~2015), which decreases the flow speed, increases the transverse size of the tail, and leads to adiabatic cooling of the outflowing matter. \nThis tentative explanation remains to be checked with detailed modeling of entrainment effects.\n\nAnother puzzling aspect is the similarity of the wedge-like shapes of the fainter part of the southern outflow (i.e., the southern outflow excluding the brightening) and the northern outflow.  Given the qualitative differences in the above interpretations of the northern and southern outflows, these similarities could be attributed to merely a chance coincidence.\nAlternatively, the structural and spectral similarities could be explained if both the northern emission and the southern emission (excluding the brightening) are caused by very energetic particles that leaked from the termination shock apex in opposite directions and diffused along the curved ISM magnetic field (the curvature of the magnetic field is required to explain the different orientations of the ``wedges''). \nIn this scenario, the brightening (whose spectrum is slightly softer than that of the rest of the southern outflow) is still interpreted as the pulsar tail, coincidentally projected onto the sky within the southern outflow.  This interpretation may look somewhat artificial, but it cannot be firmly\nexcluded with the currently available data.\n\nThe spectra of the large-scale outflows measured in several regions allow one to crudely estimate magnetic fields in these regions.  For a PL synchrotron spectrum with photon index $\\Gamma$, the magnetic field at a given magnetization parameter $\\sigma= w_B/w_e$ (ratio of energy densities of magnetic field and relativistic electrons) depends on the ratio of the luminosity $L(\\nu_m,\\nu_M)$, measured in the  $\\nu_m <\\nu <\\nu_M$ frequency range, to the radiating volume $V$. \nA simple generalization of Equation (7.14) in Pacholczyk (1970)\\footnote{Equation (7.14) gives the magnetic field for $\\sigma=3/4$ (which minimizes the total energy density $w_B+w_e$) and assumes $\\nu_m=\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_M=\\nu_2$.} to the case of arbitrary $\\sigma$ gives\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 36161, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\\title{Chandra observations of outflows from PSR J1509--5850}\n\n\\author{Noel Klingler$^1$, Oleg Kargaltsev$^1$, Blagoy Rangelov$^1$, George G.

High angular resolution observations with the {\\sl Chandra X-ray Observatory} ({\\sl CXO}) have shown that the winds are intrinsically anisotropic (both polar and equatorial outflow components are often seen, with the latter dominating in most cases; see Kargaltsev \\& Pavlov 2008). \nThe outflow morphology is also influenced by the interaction with the ambient medium, which can introduce further anisotropy.  The motion effects become particularly pronounced when the pulsar speed exceeds the sound speed in the ambient medium leading to the formation of a bow shock. \nIn this case, the outflow from the pulsar is expected to acquire a cometary shape with an extended tail behind the pulsar.  Some examples of such outflows are the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) associated with PSRs B0355+54 (McGowan et al.\\ 2006), J0357--3205 (De Luca et al.\\ 2010), and  J1741--2054 (Auchettl et al.\\ 2015).\nMoreover, there has been growing evidence that PWNe around high-speed pulsars (such as PSR B2224+65, IGR J11014--6103) exhibit puzzling elongated features in addition to cometary tails (Hui \\& Becker 2007; Pavan et al.\\ 2014, 2015).  To understand the origin of the diverse morphologies of pulsar outflows and their interaction with ambient medium, deep X-ray observations with high spatial resolution are particularly valuable. \n\nPSR J1509--5850 (J1509 hereafter) is a relatively young pulsar with spin-down age $\\tau_{\\rm sd}=154$ kyr and energy loss rate $\\dot{E}=5.1\\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (other parameters are listed in Table \\ref{tbl-parameters}).   An X-ray nebula associated with J1509 was discovered in a 40 ks {\\sl CXO} observation (Kargaltsev et al.\\ 2008; K+08 hereafter). \nIt was found to consist of a compact nebula (CN) in the pulsar vicinity and a 6 pc long elongated structure interpreted as a tail behind the pulsar moving in the northeast direction.  The PWN's non-thermal spectra were fit with an absorbed ($N_{\\rm H}=2.1^{+0.7}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) power-law (PL) model with photon indices $\\Gamma_{\\rm CN}=1.8\\pm0.3$ and $\\Gamma_{\\rm tail}=2.4\\pm0.2$ (here and everywhere below the uncertainties are given at 68\\% confidence unless specified otherwise).  \nThe luminosity of the tail was found to be  $1\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1} \\sim 2\\times 10^{-3} \\dot{E}$ in the 0.5--8 keV band (at the assumed distance of 3.8 kpc; see Table 1).  Observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) detected the tail in the radio and revealed a high degree of linear polarization whose orientation suggested a helical magnetic field (Ng et al.\\ 2010).  Additionally, a faint H$\\alpha$ halo around J1509 and a bow shock cavity were detected (Brownsberger \\& Romani 2014).\n \nThe X-ray spectrum extracted from an $r=0.9''$ aperture around the pulsar position was fitted with an absorbed PL model with a best-fit $\\Gamma_{\\rm PSR}\\approx 2.2$.  Since no X-ray pulsations could be detected (because the 3.2 s frame time was much longer than the pulsar period), the unresolved point-like emission could include a compact PWN contribution.   The pulsed emission was detected in $\\gamma$-rays by the {\\sl Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) up to energies of 3 GeV, with a PL spectrum ($\\Gamma_\\gamma = 1.36\\pm 0.23$) and high $\\gamma$-ray efficiency, $\\eta_\\gamma \\equiv L_\\gamma/\\dot{E} = 0.34\\ (d/3.8 {\\rm\\ kpc})^2$, higher than those of 75\\% of $\\gamma$-ray pulsars (see Weltevrede et al.\\ 2010 and Abdo et al.\\ 2013).\n\nIn this paper we report on the results of a series of four deep {\\sl Chandra\\ } observations of J1509 and its PWN.  In Section 2 we describe the observations and data reduction.  In Section 3 we present the images and spectral fit results.

The target was placed on the ACIS-I detector, operated in Very Faint mode with a 3.2 s time resolution.  We used the {\\sl Chandra\\ } Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO) software package (ver.\\ 4.6) and the {\\sl CXO} Calibration Data Base (CALDB, ver.\\ 4.6.3) for data processing, and restricted the energy range to 0.5--8 keV for images and spectral analysis.\nWe created exposure maps for each observation and an exposure-corrected image from the merged observation data using the CIAO routine {\\tt merge\\_obs}.  The CIAO's {\\tt wavdetect} tool (a Mexican-hat wavelet source detection routine; Freeman et al.\\ 2002) was used to detect field point sources, which were used for image alignment and then subtracted for diffuse emission analysis.  \nSpectra were extracted using the CIAO's {\\tt specextract} tool and analyzed using XSPEC (ver.\\ 12.8.2).  In all spectral fits we used the XSPEC {\\tt wabs} model with absorption cross sections from Morrison \\& McCammon (1983).\nTo study the morphology of the emission in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar, we simulate the Point Spread Function (PSF) using ChaRT ({\\sl Chandra\\ } Ray Trace) ver.\\ 2 and MARX ver.\\ 5.1.\n\n\nWe also analyzed two {\\sl XMM-Newton} observations (ObsIDs 0500630101 and 0500630301) carried out on 2008 January 29 and 2008 March 1.  The EPIC (European Photon Imaging Camera) observations of PSR J1509--5850 employed the pn, MOS1, and MOS2 cameras in full frame imaging mode with the medium filter.   We used the {\\sl XMM-Newton} Science Analysis Software (SAS, ver.\\ 14.0) for the reprocessing of the observations and data reduction. \nAfter removal of background flares, the effective exposure times are 45\\,ks (pn), 73\\,ks (MOS1), and 73\\,ks (MOS2). Because of the high background, we only use {\\sl XMM-Newton} data to analyze the pulsar spectrum (which, however, is more contaminated by the CN contribution than the {\\sl Chandra} spectrum due to the lower spatial resolution of {\\sl XMM-Newton}).\nTo minimize the contamination from the CN and the background, we use circular extraction regions with radii of $10''$ (pn) and $8''$ (MOS1\\&2) centered on the pulsar (brightness profile peak).  These extraction regions correspond to  $\\approx50$\\% of the encircled energy (Figures 6 and 7 in Section 3.2.1.1 of the {\\sl XMM-Newton} User Handbook\\footnote{http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm\\_user\\_support/\\\\documentation/uhb\\_2.1/node17.html}).\nWe use an $r=45''$ circular background region close to the pulsar (on the same chip) but away from the CN.

In addition to the extended tail (hereafter, southern outflow; 3530 net counts) previously reported by K+08, the much deeper image shows, for the first time, another fainter structure (hereafter, the northern outflow; 1,760 net counts) apparently originating from the pulsar/CN area and visible up to 7$'$ (or 7.7 pc at $d=3.8$ kpc) north of the pulsar.  Below we consider the individual PWN elements in detail. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Small-scale Structure: Compact Nebula }\nThe inset in Figure \\ref{image-raw} shows the CN structure. The peak of the X-ray brightness distribution (R.A.=$15^{\\rm h}09^{\\rm m}17\\fs136$, Decl.=$-58^{^\\circ}50'56\\farcs19$) coincides (within $0\\farcs1$) with the radio position of the pulsar (R.A.=$15^{\\rm h}09^{\\rm m}27\\fs13(3)$, Decl.=$-58^{\\circ}50'56\\farcs1(5)''$ at  MJD 51463, i.e., about 14 years before our X-ray observations).\nThe centroiding uncertainty of the X-ray position, $\\approx0\\farcs04$ (calculated by {\\tt celldetect}), is much smaller than the typical uncertainty of the {\\sl Chandra} absolute astrometry ($\\approx0\\farcs4$ at 68\\% confidence\\footnote{http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/ASPECT/celmon/}). This puts an upper limit of $\\sim 0\\farcs5$ on the pulsar position shift during 14 years, corresponding to an upper limit $\\sim 36$ mas yr$^{-1}$ on proper motion.\n\nThe PSF modeling and subtraction does not reveal any additional structure within the core region.  We also attempted PSF deconvolution using the CIAO tool {\\tt arestore}, but it did not produce anything new.  The rest of the CN structure bears much resemblance to the Geminga PWN.  Therefore, following Pavlov et al.\\ (2006), we will call the three distinct features of the CN the lateral tails and the axial tail\\footnote{The naming convention used here does not imply any physical interpretation (see Section 4 for discussion)}.   The lateral tails are noticeably longer ($\\approx$7$''-10''$, or 0.13$-$0.18 pc at $d=3.8$ kpc) than the axial tail ($\\approx$3$''$, or 0.05 pc at $d=3.8$ kpc).\n\nA wind from a fast-moving pulsar is expected to produce a termination shock with a bow-like (parabolic) structure ahead of the pulsar. However, we see no extended emission ahead of the point-like source at the leading tip of the CN (see inset in Figure 1).  To constrain the stand-off distance $\\delta_s$ of the possible unresolved shock apex ahead of the pulsar, we assume that the shape of the lateral tails represent the shock surface, fit the shape with a parabola, and estimate $\\delta_s$ as the distance between the vertex of the fitted parabola and the position of the brightness peak.\nThis approach gave us only upper limits on the stand-off distance, $\\delta_s {\\mathrel{\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{\\lower4pt\\hbox{$\\sim$}}}\\hbox{$<$}}}} 0\\farcs3$--1\\farcs0, depending on the region chosen for fitting. These fits, however, allowed us to estimate the radius of curvature at the parabola's vertex, $\\delta_c\\sim 1''$--$2''$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\epsscale{1}\n\\plotone{f1.png}\n\\caption{Merged image in the 0.5--8 keV band created from the  ACIS-I data from the 4 observations.  The image is binned by a factor of 10 (pixel size $4\\farcs9$).  The inset shows the merged image of the CN, binned by a factor of 0.5 (pixel size $0\\farcs25$) and smoothed with a $0\\farcs74$ Gaussian kernel. The following regions are shown:  pulsar, lateral tails, and axial tail.  The white arrow shows the assumed direction of the pulsar proper motion (inferred from the CN shape; see K+08); the black cross in the $r=1\\farcs7$ circle represents the pulsar's radio position.}\n\\label{image-raw}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nExamination of the CN images from individual observations suggests variability associated with the lateral tails.  This variability might be caused by the motion of blobs moving along the tails (see Figure \\ref{image-blobs-jets}\\footnote{See also the movie at \\href{http://home.gwu.edu/~kargaltsev/j1509movie.mov}{http://home.gwu.edu/$\\sim$kargaltsev/\\\\j1509movie.mov})}).\nTo quantify the changes in the positions of the blobs (shown with green and yellow ellipses in Figure \\ref{image-blobs-jets}), we measure their positions (relative to the pulsar) in the images from four separate observations and plot them as a function of time in Figure \\ref{image-blobs-plot}. The positions are measured by running CIAO's tool {\\tt celldetect}\\footnote{The tool also calculates the uncertainties of the blob positions, but they are likely to be underestimated in the presence of fainter emission within the lateral tails (typical $1\\sigma$ values range between 0\\farcs1--0\\farcs2).  Therefore, we conservatively take the actual uncertainties to be 0\\farcs5 for all blobs and use these in the fits.}.\nIt is apparent from these plots that the green data points can be approximately connected by straight lines corresponding to steady motion. If we fit a steady motion model to the green data points (omitting the others from the fitting procedure), the resulting blob speeds are $v_{\\rm b,w} = (0.32 \\pm 0.06)c$ for the western lateral tail and $v_{\\rm b,e} = (0.20 \\pm 0.05)c$ for the eastern lateral tail.\n\nThis result should be taken with some caution because the significance of the individual blobs in the individual observations is low, $\\sim 1.5\\sigma - 2\\sigma$, when using a local background (i.e. within the lateral outflows) as calculated by {\\tt celldetect}).  However, it increases to $3\\sigma$--$4\\sigma$ when the external (i.e., outside the CN) background region is used.  Moreover, under the assumption of steady motion, the same blob is seen in multiple observations and hence the combined blob significances increase to 3$\\sigma$ for the local background choice, and to $7\\sigma$--$8\\sigma$ for the external background choice. \n\nWe have also compared the merged image of the CN with the older observation (ObsID 3515, ACIS-S, 2003 Feb 9).  That observation was significantly shorter (40 ks), and the ACIS-S3 background contribution was much higher than that of the ACIS-I, making it difficult to  resolve the individual components of the CN (see Figure 4 in K+08).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{f2.png}\n\\caption{Sequence of {\\sl Chandra\\ } images showing the apparent changes in J1509's lateral tails.

One can see the lateral tails fading and apparently merging at $\\approx$27$''$ from the pulsar.  Beyond this distance the flow expands in the transverse direction and gives rise to the fainter {\\em southern outflow} seen in Figure \\ref{image-large-scale} that presents the merged image of the large-scale diffuse emission with field point sources subtracted and exposure-map correction applied\\footnote{To create this image, we followed the procedure described at http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/merge\\_all/}. \nUnexpectedly, the same image clearly reveals a similarly shaped emission north-northwest of the pulsar, although this {\\em northern outflow} is not discernible in the pulsar vicinity (Figure \\ref{image-mid-scale}).\n\nThe shapes of both large-scale structures, extending up to $6'-7'$ from the pulsar, can be crudely described as two wedges with $\\approx 17^\\circ$ opening angles and tips at (or near) the pulsar position.  The southern outflow is approximately aligned with the CN symmetry axis, while the northern outflow is inclined to the CN symmetry axis by $\\approx 33^\\circ$.\nAlthough the sizes and shapes of these outflows are similar, the distributions of surface brightness within the two structures are markedly different.  The averaged (over the transverse direction) surface brightness of the southern outflow (see Figure \\ref{image-radio} for the profile extraction regions) appears to decrease almost linearly with distance from the pulsar (see Figure \\ref{figure-tail-brightness}), while the averaged surface brightness of the northern outflow does not appear to change significantly over its length (shown in Figure \\ref{figure-headlight-brightness}).  \nMoreover, a substantially brighter region (hereafter referred to as the ``brightening'') is clearly seen within the southern outflow up to $\\approx 4'$ from the pulsar, while no such a feature is seen in the northern outflow. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\epsscale{1.1}\n\\plotone{f5.png}\n\\caption{Exposure-map-corrected, merged {\\sl Chandra} ACIS image showing the large-scale structure of the J1509 PWN in the 0.5--8.0 keV band.

It becomes wider than the X-ray outflow beyond $\\approx 3'$ from the pulsar and then narrows down again beyond $\\approx 5'$.  The radio outflow is seen up to $10'$ from of the pulsar, whereas the visible southern X-ray outflow becomes comparable with the background at about $7'$ from the pulsar.   No radio emission is seen from the northern outflow region in the same ATCA observation.\n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\epsscale{0.9}\n\\plotone{f6.png}\n\\caption{Composite image produced from the merged, exposure-map-corrected (fluxed) {\\sl Chandra\\ } ACIS images (red; binned by a factor of 8) and the 6 cm  ATCA image (blue; see Ng et al.\\ 2010) showing the extended emissions of J1509, both smoothed with a $r=11\\farcs8$ Gaussian kernel.

We also divide the entire southern outflow region into 4 segments, with segment 1 being the closest to the pulsar and segment 4 being the farthest.  \nFor the northern outflow, we define two regions: the proximal and distal halves (cyan polygons).  We fit all spectra with an absorbed PL model (unless specified otherwise) and list the fitting parameters Table \\ref{spatially-resolved-spectra}.  For all regions, the spectra from different observations are fitted simultaneously, with the all parameters being tied together.\nFitting the southern outflow brightening yields an absorbing column density $N_{\\rm H}= (1.66\\pm0.19)\\times 10^{22} $  cm$^{-2}$ and a photon index $\\Gamma=2.11\\pm0.07$, with reduced chi-squared $\\chi_\\nu^2=1.01$ for $\\nu=73$ degrees of freedom (d.o.f.).  Since the spectrum from this region fits the PL model well, and has a relatively small background contribution and a good statistic, we fix $N_{\\rm H}$ at the best-fit value obtained for this region while fitting the spectra from other regions which have poorer statistics\\footnote{We have also obtained the same value of $N_H$ by fitting the spectra from the lateral tails and the pulsar/head region.}. \n \nFor the CN regions, we obtained very similar PL slopes for the pulsar/head and the lateral tails ($\\Gamma=1.90\\pm0.12$ and $1.80\\pm0.13$, respectively) while the axial tail appears to have a harder spectrum ($\\Gamma=1.43\\pm0.18$).  It is plausible that a substantial fraction of the pulsar/head emission comes from the neutron star and hence it may have a thermal component.\nTherefore, we attempted to fit the pulsar/head spectrum with a PL + blackbody (BB) model (with a fixed BB radius of 12 km).  This resulted in a slightly better fit, with $\\Gamma=1.77\\pm0.13$, $kT=103\\pm4$ eV, and $\\chi_\\nu^2=0.77$ for 53 d.o.f.  However, the best-fit BB+PL model is preferred over the PL model at a 93\\% ($1.8\\sigma$) confidence, according to the F-test (i.e., the BB component is not required by the data).  \nWe find an upper limit on the neutron star surface temperature by gradually increasing the temperature of the BB component (and re-fitting the PL component at each new temperature chosen) until the model becomes inconsistent with the data at a $3\\sigma$ confidence level.  This yields an upper limit $kT=115$ eV (or $T=1.3\\times10^6$ K). \n\nAlthough the quality of the fits is good for all the CN regions (see Table \\ref{spatially-resolved-spectra}), the fits of the pulsar/head spectrum (see Figure \\ref{image-psr-spectra}) shows some systematic residuals centered at 3.5 keV (between 3.3--3.6 keV).  To examine plausibility of the alleged spectral feature, we jointly fit the {\\sl XMM-Newton} spectra from two observations (see Figure \\ref{image-xmm-psr-spectra}) extracted from  circular regions ($r=10''$ and $8''$ for the pn and MOS detectors; see Section 2) centered on the pulsar with the absorbed PL model and $N_{\\rm H}$  fixed at the same value as for the ACIS spectral fits. \nThis gave a similar spectral slope, $\\Gamma=1.9 \\pm 0.2$, but a hint of an emission feature at $\\approx 3.5$ keV is seen in the pn spectrum from only one observation while the pn spectrum from the other observation shows a hint of absorption, which means that the feature is likely a statistical fluctuation. The MOS spectra do not have enough counts to look for spectral features. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\epsscale{1.2}\n\\plotone{f9.png}\n\\caption{The ACIS-I spectrum for the pulsar/head region.  {\\sl Top:} Simultaneous fitting of the spectra from the 4 observations with an absorbed PL model ($\\Gamma= 1.90\\pm0.12$, $N_{\\rm H}=1.66$, and $\\chi_\\nu^2=0.82$ for 54 d.o.f.).  {\\sl Bottom:} Pulsar spectrum obtained by merging the spectra from the 4 observations.

For the southern outflow segments 1--4, we obtain $\\Gamma_{\\rm S1}=1.99\\pm0.12$, $\\Gamma_{\\rm S2}=2.28\\pm0.16$, $\\Gamma_{\\rm S3}=2.06\\pm0.10$, and $\\Gamma_{\\rm S4}=1.82\\pm0.12$.  We do not see any systematic softening of the spectrum along the southern emission despite its large extent; rather there is a hint of hardening from segment 2 to 4.   Almost all fits are of good quality (the poorest quality fit, $\\chi_\\nu^2=1.26$ for 46 d.o.f., being for segment 1, its spectrum is shown in Figure \\ref{image-tail-seg-1-spectra}). \n\nThe slope of the spectrum for the entire northern outflow ($\\Gamma=1.81\\pm0.10$) is similar to the spectrum of the southern outflow excluding the brightening ($\\Gamma=1.78\\pm0.09$) although, unlike the southern outflow, the northern outflow spectrum shows a hint of softening with increasing distance from the pulsar ($\\Gamma$ changes from $1.50\\pm0.20$ to $1.98 \\pm0.11$). This may explain the somewhat poorer quality of the PL fit to the spectrum of the entire northern outflow (see Table \\ref{spatially-resolved-spectra}).  The photon indices for all regions as a function of distance from the pulsar are shown in Figure \\ref{image-gamma-fn-dist}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\epsscale{1.2}\n\\plotone{f12.pdf}\n\\caption{Photon index as a function of distance from the pulsar.

The overall shape of the CN and the southern outflow supports the earlier suggestion that they are due to the shocked wind of the pulsar moving in the north-northeast direction with a supersonic speed. \nThe deeper image has also revealed a previously undetected faint structure, the northern outflow, extending $\\approx7'$ to the north from the pulsar position.  Below we consider possible interpretations for the different components of the J1509 PWN and compare them to those seen in other PWNe.\n\n\\subsection{The Spatial and Spectral Structure of the PWN}\n\n\\subsubsection{Compact Nebula}\nThe structure of the J1509 CN is very similar to that of the Geminga PWN (Pavlov et al.\\ 2006, 2010; see Figure \\ref{bowshocks}), both in shape (one axial and two lateral tails) and in (projected) physical size ($\\sim 8\\times 10^{17}$ cm for the lateral tails, and $\\sim 2\\times 10^{17}$ cm for the axial tail, for $d_{\\rm Gem} = 250$ pc and $d_{\\rm J1509}=3.8$ kpc).  It is reasonable to expect that the physical sizes of compact nebulae with similar structures are proportional to $(\\dot{E}/\\rho v^2)^{1/2}$, where $\\rho$ is the ambient density, and $v$ is the pulsar velocity. \nAssuming also similar angles $i$ between the line of sight and the pulsar motion direction, and taking into account that $\\dot{E}_{\\rm J1509} \\simeq 15\\, \\dot{E}_{\\rm Gem}$, we can crudely estimate the speed of the J1509 pulsar:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nv_{\\rm J1509}\\sim790 \\left( \\frac{v_{\\rm Gem}}{200~{\\rm km~s}^{-1}} \\right) \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm Gem}}{\\rho_{\\rm J1509}}\\right)^{1/2}~{\\rm km~s}^{-1}.\n\\label{J1509velocity}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"v_{\\rm J1509}\\sim 790\\left(\\frac{v_{\\rm Gem}}{200~{}{\\rm km~{}s}^{-1}}\\right)%&#10;\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm Gem}}{\\rho_{\\rm J1509}}\\right)^{1/2}~{}{\\rm km~{}s}^{-1}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>J1509</mi></msub><mo>\u223c</mo><mrow><mn>790</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>Gem</mi></msub><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>200</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>km</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>Gem</mi></msub><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>J1509</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>km</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07174.tex", "nexttext": "\nIn this equation, $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$  are the characteristic synchrotron frequencies ($\\nu_{\\rm syn}\\simeq eB\\gamma^2/2\\pi mc$) corresponding to the boundary energies ($\\gamma_1 m_ec^2$ and $\\gamma_2 m_ec^2$) of the electron spectrum ($dN_e/d\\gamma \\propto \\gamma^{-p}\\propto \\gamma^{-2\\Gamma+1}$; $\\gamma_1<\\gamma<\\gamma_2$), \nand $\\mathcal{A}=2^{1/2}e^{7/2}/18 \\pi^{1/2}m_e^{5/2}c^{9/2}$.

Since $L\\propto d^2$ and $V\\propto d^3$, the magnetic field estimated from Equation (\\ref{synch_magn_field}) weakly depends on the assumed distance, $B\\propto d^{-2/7}$.  The boundary frequencies $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$ are unknown. \nThe exact value of $\\nu_2$ is not really important as long as $(\\nu_1/\\nu_2)^{\\Gamma -1.5}\\ll 1$, so we choose a plausible (but arbitrary) value $h\\nu_2=100$ keV.  The unknown frequency $\\nu_1$ is the main source of uncertainty of the magnetic field at a given $\\sigma$, for the measured spectral slopes. \nFor the southern outflow, we can at least estimate a lower limit on $\\nu_1$ from the requirement that extrapolation of the X-ray PL spectrum to lower frequencies does not exceed the harder radio spectrum ($\\Gamma_{\\rm rad}=1.26\\pm 0.04$; Ng et al.\\ 2010), but even the limit, $\\nu_1{\\mathrel{\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{\\lower4pt\\hbox{$\\sim$}}}\\hbox{$>$}}}} 10^{10}$--$10^{12}$ Hz, is not very certain because of the uncertainty of the X-ray photon indices (and because the slope of the radio spectrum was measured in a broader region).\nSince the northern outflow was not detected in the radio, we can only guess that $\\nu_1$ is higher there than in the southern outflow (which would be consistent with our hypothesis that the northern outflow emission is due to leaked particles with very high energies). Given these uncertainties, we estimate the magnetic fields assuming $\\nu_1=100$ GHz for all the regions. If future multiwavelength observations yield different estimates of $\\nu_1$, the magnetic field could be scaled (approximately) as $B\\propto \\nu_1^{(3-2\\Gamma)/7}$ (if $(\\nu_1/\\nu_2)^{\\Gamma -1.5}\\ll 1$). \n\nThe equipartition magnetic fields, $B_{\\rm eq}=B\\sigma^{-2/7}$, for different parts of the J1509 southern and northern outflows are given in Table \\ref{b-fields}, for the above-described choice of boundary frequencies and $d=3.8$ kpc.  Although the actual magnetic field strengths can differ from those in Table \\ref{b-fields} by a factor of a few, we can at least hope that their relative values reflect the spatial dependence of the magnetic field in the emitting regions.\nSurprisingly, the magnetic field in the southern outflow shows a hint of non-monotonic dependence on distance from the pulsar: the field grows from segment 1 to segment 2, and then decreases outwards (in concert with the photon index $\\Gamma$ and slope $p$ of electron spectrum).  The reason for such behavior is unclear, and we cannot exclude that it is simply due to a variation of unknown parameters (e.g., $\\nu_1$ and/or $\\sigma$ along the outflow). \n\nSince the southern outflow was detected in radio (Ng et al.\\ 2010), the radio spectrum ($\\Gamma_{\\rm rad}\\approx 1.26$) can also be used for magnetic field estimates. If the radio and X-ray spectra are generated in different regions (e.g., the radio emission comes from a  ``sheath'' around an X-ray emitting ``spine'' of the outflow), the magnetic field in the radio-emitting region should be estimated solely from the radio spectrum, which gives $B_{\\rm rad} \\simeq 13\\, \\sigma_{\\rm rad}^{2/7}$ $\\mu$G for $L_{\\rm rad}(\\nu_m,\\nu_M) = 1.5\\times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$, $V_{\\rm rad} = 5\\times 10^{56}$ cm$^3$, $\\nu_1=\\nu_m=10$ MHz, $\\nu_2=\\nu_M=100$ GHz ($\\sigma_{\\rm rad}$ is the magnetization in this region).\nThis value of $B_{\\rm rad}$ is close to those determined from the X-ray spectra in segments 3 and 4 (assuming $\\sigma_{\\rm rad} \\sim \\sigma$).  If the radio spectrum in the X-ray detected part of the southern outflow is generated in the same region as the X-ray emission, then the mutiwavelength (radio to X-rays) spectrum can be considered as a broken PL. \nThe magnetic field from such a spectrum could be estimated for a given magnetization $\\sigma = (\\sigma_{\\rm rad}^{-1} + \\sigma_X^{-1})^{-1}$, where $\\sigma_{\\rm rad}$ and $\\sigma_X$ (each of them is greater than $\\sigma$) are magnetizations corresponding to the energy densities of particles responsible for radiation below and above the break frequency, respectively.  In this case, the equipartition field would be slightly higher than those estimated separately from the X-ray and radio spectra, but the difference would be within the uncertainties.\n\nAccording to Table \\ref{b-fields}, the difference of the equipartition fields in the two segments of the northern outflow is within the $B_{\\rm eq}$ uncertainties caused by the uncertainties of the spectral slopes. The characteristic equipartition field, $B_{\\rm eq}\\sim 5$--10 $\\mu$G, is lower than typical values for the southern outflow\\footnote{It would be even lower if we assume a $\\nu_1$ value higher than 100 GHz for the northern outflow.}. \nHowever, if the X-ray emission from the northern outflow is indeed due to particles of very high energy leaked from the termination shock apex, then  \n$\\sigma$ can be very different from unity, and $B$ very different from $B_{\\rm eq}$.\n\n\nThe magnetic field strengths can be used to estimate the Lorentz factors,  gyration radii, and characteristic synchrotron cooling times of electrons radiating synchrotron photons with energy $E$:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 50279, "prevtext": "\n\nAn upper limit on the pulsar velocity follows from the lack of any significant shift of the pulsar position over $\\approx$14 years, $\\delta{\\mathrel{\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{\\lower4pt\\hbox{$\\sim$}}}\\hbox{$<$}}}} 0\\farcs5$ (see Section 3.1.1), which gives $v_{\\rm J1509}\\,\\sin i< 640 (\\delta/0.5'') (d/3.8\\,{\\rm kpc})$ km s$^{-1}$.  A possible lower limit on the pulsar velocity can be estimated from the lack of resolved extended emission ahead of the pulsar. \nIf there is a (quasi-)isotropic component of the pulsar wind, it should produce a bullet-like termination shock with the apex (bullet head) distance $r_s = (\\dot{E}/4\\pi c\\rho v^2)^{1/2}$.  For $\\sin i=1$, the upper limit on the angular apex distance of $1\\farcs0$ (see Section 3.1.1) implies $r_s <5.7\\times10^{16}(d/3.8~{\\rm kpc})$ cm, $p_{\\rm amb} = \\rho_{\\rm J1509}v_{\\rm J1509}^{2}>4.2\\times10^{-10}(d/3.8~{\\rm kpc})^{-2}$ dyn cm$^{-2}$, and $v_{\\rm J1509}\\gtrsim160 n^{-1/2}(d/3.8~{\\rm kpc})^{-1}$ km s$^{-1}$, where $n=\\rho/m_{p}$ is the ISM number density.\n\nDespite the morphological similarities, there are also notable differences between the two PWNe. The spectra of the lateral tails are much softer in the J1509 CN than in the Geminga PWN ($\\Gamma=1.8\\pm0.1$ vs.\\ $\\Gamma=0.7$--$1.1$, respectively), while the lateral tails' luminosity, $L_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV} = (7.5\\pm 0.5)\\times 10^{31} (d/3.8\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ for J1509, is a factor of  $\\sim200$ higher\\footnote{The photon indices and luminosity of Geminga's lateral tails are based on recent deep {\\sl Chandra} ACIS observations (Posselt et al., in prep.)}.\nThe higher luminosity could be attributed to the larger $\\dot{E}$, but the radiative X-ray efficiency for J1509's lateral tails is also significantly higher: $\\eta_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV} \\equiv L_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV}/\\dot{E}\\simeq1.5\\times10^{-4}(d/3.8\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ for J1509 vs.\\ $1.2\\times 10^{-5} (d/0.25\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ for Geminga. \nAnother difference is that there is a clear presence of faint diffuse emission between the lateral tails (beyond the extent of the shorter axial tail) in the J1509 CN (see the inset in Figure \\ref{image-raw}), while it was not detected in the Geminga PWN (Posselt et al., in prep.; Pavlov et al.\\ 2010).\n\nNumerical simulations of the synchrotron brightness distributions from PWNe of supersonically moving pulsars with isotropic wind ejection (Bucciantini et al.\\ 2005) predict filled structures with the brightness reaching its maximum ahead of the moving pulsar and gradually decreasing behind the pulsar (see Figures 4 and 5 in Bucciantini et al.\\ 2005).  \nThese simulated synchrotron brightness maps do not resemble the observed structures of the CNe around J1509 and Geminga.  One reason could be that the magnetic field structure is substantially different from that assumed in the simulations.  Bucciantini et al.\\ (2005) mention that the magnetic field may be compressed in narrow layers near the contact discontinuity surface, which, in principle, could produce limb-brightened structures, depending on the amount of Doppler boosting (caused by a high bulk flow velocity) and the magnetic field geometry.\nAnother reason could be that the assumption of isotropic wind injection used in the simulations is not valid for real pulsars.  For instance, one could interpret the lateral tails as jets or an equatorial outflow bent back by the ram pressure. However, at least the jet interpretation looks unrealistic as it requires stretching some of the parameters to their extremities. \nIndeed, a jet produced by a moving pulsar bends because the jet flow acquires a momentum from the ambient medium; it becomes comparable to the original jet flow momentum over the bending length scale (curvature radius)\\footnote{This estimate neglects possible entrainment of the ambient medium into the jet.} $l_b\\sim\\xi_j\\dot{E}/(c r_j \\rho v^2 \\sin\\alpha)$, where $\\xi_j<1$ is the fraction of the spin-down power $\\dot{E}$ that goes into the jet, $r_j$ is the jet radius, and $\\alpha$  is the angle between the initial jet direction and the pulsar's velocity.\nFor J1509, we obtain $l_b\\sim 2 \\times10^{17}\\xi_j (r_j/5.7\\times10^{16} {\\rm cm})^{-1} n^{-1} (\\sin \\alpha)^{-1} (v_{\\rm J1509}/300\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1})^{-2}$~cm.  Therefore, for a jet with the angular width $\\delta_j\\sim1''$, a significant bending on a scale of the observed curvature radius $\\delta_c\\sim 1''$--$2''$ (see Section 3.1.1) implies that most of the spin-down power goes into the two jets. However, observations of PWNe with both jet and equatorial components suggest $\\xi_j \\ll1$ (e.g., Kargaltsev \\& Pavlov 2008; Pavlov et al.\\ 2003). \nTherefore, the jet interpretation of the lateral tails would imply that in some pulsars jets can be more powerful than equatorial outflows.  More extensive modeling and simulations are needed to see whether it is possible to reproduce the observed CN morphologies for other assumptions on the angular distribution of the pulsar wind injection.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\epsscale{1.1}\n\\plotone{f13.png}\n\\caption{{\\sl Chandra\\ } images of PWNe with prominent tails.  {\\sl Top left:} J1747--2958 (the Mouse; Kargaltsev et al.\\ in prep.), {\\sl top center:} Geminga (Posselt et al., in prep.), {\\sl top right:} J1741--2054 (Auchettl et al.\\ 2015), {\\sl bottom left:} B0355+54 (Klingler et al., in prep), {\\sl bottom center:} J0357+3205 (De Luca et al.\\ 2013), {\\sl bottom right:} J1509--5850 (this paper).}\n\\label{bowshocks}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe also note that the morphologies of the Geminga and J1509 CNe are markedly different from those of other bow-shock PWNe.  In particular, others exhibit a CN with a local minimum in brightness in the pulsar vicinity (i.e., behind the pulsar; PWNe of PSRs J0357+3205 and J1101--6101), or exhibit a filled CN morphology (PWNe of PSRs J1747--2958, J1741--2054, and B0355+54). \nThe differences, however, are not limited to X-ray morphologies only.  For instance, the radio counterparts of the PWNe associated with PSRs J1509--5850 (Ng et al.\\ 2010), J1101--6101 (Pavan et al.\\ 2014), and J1747--2958 (the Mouse; Yusef-Zadeh \\& Gaensler  2005), the radio brightness distributions are also quite different.  While the radio brightness in the Mouse is maximal near the pulsar (similar to X-rays; Gaensler et al.\\ 2004), in the other two PWNe the radio brightness is low near the pulsar and becomes higher further away (see Figure \\ref{image-radio}).  \nWe also note that the X-ray morphologies of most of the other CNe in Figure \\ref{bowshocks} do not bear much resemblance to the simulated images, except perhaps for the Mouse and J1741--2054.  Ng et al.\\ (2010) mentioned an open cluster, Ruprecht 112 (C1453--623; Alter et al.\\ 1970), about 4$^{\\circ}$ southwest of the current pulsar position, as a possible birth place of the pulsar.  \nAt the distance of 3.8 kpc and the pulsar's spin-down age of 150 kyr, the required pulsar velocity would be $\\sim1700$ km s$^{-1}$, much higher than the upper limit of 640 km s$^{-1}$ on the transverse velocity inferred from the lack of detectable change of the pulsar position in 14 years.\nBased on the comparison of the older X-ray image with the shape of the termination shock ``bullet'' seen in numerical simulations, K+08 suggested that the pulsar velocity should be  $\\sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$, which is still within the allowed velocity range (see above).  However, since the deeper X-ray images reveal substantial differences between the CN structure and the simulations, this velocity estimate should be taken with caution.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Large-scale PWN Structure}\nThe most puzzling new feature of the J1509 PWN is the large-scale northern outflow seen up to $\\sim 7'$ almost ahead of the pulsar.  One could assume that the northern outflow is a powerful relativistic jet piercing the bow shock near the pulsar.  The lack of a counter-jet could be explained by Doppler boosting, but there are other problems with the jet interpretation.\nAccording to the estimates in Section 4.1.1, the bending length for a jet is very small, even at $\\xi_j\\sim 1$ and $\\sin\\alpha\\sim 0.5$, compared to the length of the northern outflow that shows no bending.  It is also difficult to explain the relative faintness of the northern outflow closer to the pulsar \n(but outside the CN) in the jet scenario.  Finally, the X-ray radiation efficiency of the northern outflow, $\\eta_{0.5-8\\, keV}\\sim 0.8\\times 10^{-3}$, substantially exceeds the efficiencies of jets of younger PWNe with clear torus-jet morphology.  Therefore, we discard the jet interpretation for the northern outflow.\n\nSimilar arguments have led Bandiera (2008) to conclude that the extended X-ray feature accompanying the Guitar nebula (which also exhibits a large-scale outflow misaligned with the pulsar motion direction; see Figure \\ref{image-guitar} and Johnson \\& Wang 2010) cannot be interpreted as a hydrodynamical jet.  Following Bandiera (2008), we consider a scenario in which particles with the highest energies leak from the termination shock apex into the ISM, and travel along the ordered ISM magnetic field.\nBandiera (2008) suggested that the length of the Guitar PWN feature, $\\sim 1.4$ pc, is on the order of the radiation length (i.e., the distance over which particles lose a substantial fraction of their energy to synchrotron radiation).  However, this assumption implies a propagation speed of only a few thousands km s$^{-1}$, instead of the speed of light, as expected for particles with large (bulk) Lorentz factors.     \nBandiera (2008) argued that the turbulent component of the magnetic field would provide a scattering mechanism and slow down particle propagation (which can then be considered as diffusion) along the ISM magnetic field to the required non-relativistic speed.  The observed hint of softening of the X-ray spectrum in J1509's northern outflow can be considered as supporting this scenario.  \nA problem with this scenario is that in all three cases with prominent misaligned (with respect to pulsar motion) X-ray features (the Guitar, J1509, and J1101--6101), the features appear to be one-sided or show very faint ``counter-features'', which means that there is a preferred direction for the escape of the high-energy particles. The cause of this asymmetry is currently unclear. \nOn the other hand, since the particles escaping from the termination shock apex into the ISM must be the most energetic ones (those with large gyration radii; see Bandiera 2008), the lack of radio synchrotron emission can be naturally explained by the deficit of lower energy particles.\n\nThe southern outflow is aligned with the CN symmetry axis and clearly represents a continuation of the CN (see Figure \\ref{image-mid-scale}).  Therefore, we can assume that at least the brighter part of the southern outflow can be interpreted as a tail filled with the shocked pulsar wind confined by the ram pressure.\nThe lack of evidence for synchrotron burn-off in the X-ray spectra suggests a high flow speed and/or a low magnetic field.  Alternatively, there could be some ``reheating'' due to in-situ conversion of magnetic field energy into particle energy, e.g., via turbulent processes and accompanying reconnection, which might explain the hint of spectral hardening at large distances from the pulsar (see Figure \\ref{image-gamma-fn-dist}.)  \nIndeed, Ng et al.\\ (2010) reported the presence of substantial turbulent magnetic field components in the tail using radio polarimetry data.  \n\nThere are, however, some puzzling aspects associated with the southern outflow.  One is that the radio emission brightens with distance from the pulsar and becomes broader than the X-ray emission beyond $\\approx 3'$ (see Figure \\ref{image-radio}).  Such behavior could possibly be caused by entrainment of ambient matter (see also Morlino et al.~2015), which decreases the flow speed, increases the transverse size of the tail, and leads to adiabatic cooling of the outflowing matter. \nThis tentative explanation remains to be checked with detailed modeling of entrainment effects.\n\nAnother puzzling aspect is the similarity of the wedge-like shapes of the fainter part of the southern outflow (i.e., the southern outflow excluding the brightening) and the northern outflow.  Given the qualitative differences in the above interpretations of the northern and southern outflows, these similarities could be attributed to merely a chance coincidence.\nAlternatively, the structural and spectral similarities could be explained if both the northern emission and the southern emission (excluding the brightening) are caused by very energetic particles that leaked from the termination shock apex in opposite directions and diffused along the curved ISM magnetic field (the curvature of the magnetic field is required to explain the different orientations of the ``wedges''). \nIn this scenario, the brightening (whose spectrum is slightly softer than that of the rest of the southern outflow) is still interpreted as the pulsar tail, coincidentally projected onto the sky within the southern outflow.  This interpretation may look somewhat artificial, but it cannot be firmly\nexcluded with the currently available data.\n\nThe spectra of the large-scale outflows measured in several regions allow one to crudely estimate magnetic fields in these regions.  For a PL synchrotron spectrum with photon index $\\Gamma$, the magnetic field at a given magnetization parameter $\\sigma= w_B/w_e$ (ratio of energy densities of magnetic field and relativistic electrons) depends on the ratio of the luminosity $L(\\nu_m,\\nu_M)$, measured in the  $\\nu_m <\\nu <\\nu_M$ frequency range, to the radiating volume $V$. \nA simple generalization of Equation (7.14) in Pacholczyk (1970)\\footnote{Equation (7.14) gives the magnetic field for $\\sigma=3/4$ (which minimizes the total energy density $w_B+w_e$) and assumes $\\nu_m=\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_M=\\nu_2$.} to the case of arbitrary $\\sigma$ gives\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nB=\\left[\\frac{L(\\nu_m,\\nu_M)\\sigma}{\\mathcal{A} V} \\frac{\\Gamma-2}{\\Gamma-1.5}\\frac{\\nu_1^{1.5-\\Gamma}-\\nu_2^{1.5-\\Gamma}}{\\nu_m^{2-\\Gamma}-\\nu_M^{2-\\Gamma}} \\right]^{2/7}.\n\\label{synch_magn_field}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"B=\\left[\\frac{L(\\nu_{m},\\nu_{M})\\sigma}{\\mathcal{A}V}\\frac{\\Gamma-2}{\\Gamma-1.%&#10;5}\\frac{\\nu_{1}^{1.5-\\Gamma}-\\nu_{2}^{1.5-\\Gamma}}{\\nu_{m}^{2-\\Gamma}-\\nu_{M}^%&#10;{2-\\Gamma}}\\right]^{2/7}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>M</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udc9c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1.5</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03bd</mi><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03bd</mi><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>m</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07174.tex", "nexttext": "\n \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 56227, "prevtext": "\nIn this equation, $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$  are the characteristic synchrotron frequencies ($\\nu_{\\rm syn}\\simeq eB\\gamma^2/2\\pi mc$) corresponding to the boundary energies ($\\gamma_1 m_ec^2$ and $\\gamma_2 m_ec^2$) of the electron spectrum ($dN_e/d\\gamma \\propto \\gamma^{-p}\\propto \\gamma^{-2\\Gamma+1}$; $\\gamma_1<\\gamma<\\gamma_2$), \nand $\\mathcal{A}=2^{1/2}e^{7/2}/18 \\pi^{1/2}m_e^{5/2}c^{9/2}$.

If future multiwavelength observations yield different estimates of $\\nu_1$, the magnetic field could be scaled (approximately) as $B\\propto \\nu_1^{(3-2\\Gamma)/7}$ (if $(\\nu_1/\\nu_2)^{\\Gamma -1.5}\\ll 1$). \n\nThe equipartition magnetic fields, $B_{\\rm eq}=B\\sigma^{-2/7}$, for different parts of the J1509 southern and northern outflows are given in Table \\ref{b-fields}, for the above-described choice of boundary frequencies and $d=3.8$ kpc.  Although the actual magnetic field strengths can differ from those in Table \\ref{b-fields} by a factor of a few, we can at least hope that their relative values reflect the spatial dependence of the magnetic field in the emitting regions.\nSurprisingly, the magnetic field in the southern outflow shows a hint of non-monotonic dependence on distance from the pulsar: the field grows from segment 1 to segment 2, and then decreases outwards (in concert with the photon index $\\Gamma$ and slope $p$ of electron spectrum).  The reason for such behavior is unclear, and we cannot exclude that it is simply due to a variation of unknown parameters (e.g., $\\nu_1$ and/or $\\sigma$ along the outflow). \n\nSince the southern outflow was detected in radio (Ng et al.\\ 2010), the radio spectrum ($\\Gamma_{\\rm rad}\\approx 1.26$) can also be used for magnetic field estimates. If the radio and X-ray spectra are generated in different regions (e.g., the radio emission comes from a  ``sheath'' around an X-ray emitting ``spine'' of the outflow), the magnetic field in the radio-emitting region should be estimated solely from the radio spectrum, which gives $B_{\\rm rad} \\simeq 13\\, \\sigma_{\\rm rad}^{2/7}$ $\\mu$G for $L_{\\rm rad}(\\nu_m,\\nu_M) = 1.5\\times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$, $V_{\\rm rad} = 5\\times 10^{56}$ cm$^3$, $\\nu_1=\\nu_m=10$ MHz, $\\nu_2=\\nu_M=100$ GHz ($\\sigma_{\\rm rad}$ is the magnetization in this region).\nThis value of $B_{\\rm rad}$ is close to those determined from the X-ray spectra in segments 3 and 4 (assuming $\\sigma_{\\rm rad} \\sim \\sigma$).  If the radio spectrum in the X-ray detected part of the southern outflow is generated in the same region as the X-ray emission, then the mutiwavelength (radio to X-rays) spectrum can be considered as a broken PL. \nThe magnetic field from such a spectrum could be estimated for a given magnetization $\\sigma = (\\sigma_{\\rm rad}^{-1} + \\sigma_X^{-1})^{-1}$, where $\\sigma_{\\rm rad}$ and $\\sigma_X$ (each of them is greater than $\\sigma$) are magnetizations corresponding to the energy densities of particles responsible for radiation below and above the break frequency, respectively.  In this case, the equipartition field would be slightly higher than those estimated separately from the X-ray and radio spectra, but the difference would be within the uncertainties.\n\nAccording to Table \\ref{b-fields}, the difference of the equipartition fields in the two segments of the northern outflow is within the $B_{\\rm eq}$ uncertainties caused by the uncertainties of the spectral slopes. The characteristic equipartition field, $B_{\\rm eq}\\sim 5$--10 $\\mu$G, is lower than typical values for the southern outflow\\footnote{It would be even lower if we assume a $\\nu_1$ value higher than 100 GHz for the northern outflow.}. \nHowever, if the X-ray emission from the northern outflow is indeed due to particles of very high energy leaked from the termination shock apex, then  \n$\\sigma$ can be very different from unity, and $B$ very different from $B_{\\rm eq}$.\n\n\nThe magnetic field strengths can be used to estimate the Lorentz factors,  gyration radii, and characteristic synchrotron cooling times of electrons radiating synchrotron photons with energy $E$:\n\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma\\sim 10^{8}(E/1\\,{\\rm keV})^{1/2}(B/20\\,\\mu{\\rm G})^{-1/2} ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\gamma\\sim 10^{8}(E/1\\,{\\rm keV})^{1/2}(B/20\\,\\mu{\\rm G})^{-1/2},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u223c</mo><mrow><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>8</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>/</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>1</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>keV</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>/</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>20</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">G</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07174.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nand \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 56328, "prevtext": "\n \n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nr_g\\sim  10^{14}(E/1\\,{\\rm keV})^{1/2}(B/20\\,\\mu{\\rm G})^{-3/2}~{\\rm cm},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"r_{g}\\sim 10^{14}(E/1\\,{\\rm keV})^{1/2}(B/20\\,\\mu{\\rm G})^{-3/2}~{}{\\rm cm},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>g</mi></msub><mo>\u223c</mo><mrow><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>14</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>/</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>1</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>keV</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>/</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>20</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">G</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>cm</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07174.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nThe spatially-resolved X-ray spectra of the outflows allow one to crudely estimate (or constrain) characteristic flow velocities.

On the other hand, $\\dot{E}_{\\rm North}$ exceeds the 0.5--8 keV luminosity of the northern outflow (by a factor of 5 at the parameters chosen and $\\sigma\\sim 1$, but the value of this factor strongly depends on the poorly known outflow parameters).\n\nIn the southern outflow we see no spectral softening with increasing distance from the pulsar (i.e., no synchrotron cooling).  If there is no in-situ particle acceleration in the outflow, the lack of cooling sets a lower limit on the flow velocity of a few thousand km s$^{-1}$ (K+08), well above the upper limit on the pulsar velocity.  The value of the limiting speed is somewhat uncertain because of the magnetic field uncertainties.  \nMoreover, the hint of spectral hardening with increasing distance from the pulsar (see Figure \\ref{image-gamma-fn-dist}) suggests that particle acceleration may occur in the southern outflow (e.g., due to magnetic field reconnection), which would invalidate the velocity estimates based on passive cooling.  \nAn upper limit of a few tens of thousands km s$^{-1}$ on the characteristic flow velocity can be estimated from the condition $\\dot{E}_{\\rm South}< \\dot{E}$, where $\\dot{E}_{\\rm South}\\sim w S v_{\\rm flow}$, similar to Equation (7).\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{lcccc}[H]\n\\tablecolumns{5}\n\\tablecaption{Magnetic Field Estimates\n\\label{b-fields}}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablehead{\\colhead{Region}  & \\colhead{$p$} &  \\colhead{$L_{32}$} & \\colhead{$V_{55}$}  & \\colhead{$B_{\\rm eq,-6}$} }\n\\startdata\nS.\\ outflow seg.\\ 1 & $2.98\\pm0.24$ &1.3 & 2.6 & $36_{-12}^{+23}$ \\\\\nS.\\ outflow seg.\\ 2 & $3.56\\pm 0.32$ &  1.4 & 7.4 & $89_{-42}^{+16}$  \\\\ \nS.\\ outflow seg.\\ 3 & $3.12\\pm0.20$ & 3.4 & 42 & $29_{-9}^{+14}$ \\\\ \nS.\\ outflow seg.\\ 4  & $2.64\\pm0.24$   & 3.2 & 125 & $9_{-3}^{+4}$ \\\\\nN.\\ outflow (proximal) & $2.00\\pm0.40$ &  1.0 & 9.1 & $5_{-1}^{+4}$ \\\\ \nN.\\ outflow (distal) & $2.96\\pm0.22$ &  3.3 & 76 & $10_{-2}^{+4}$ \\\\\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\\tablecomments{The values are given for different regions of the northern (N) and southern (S) outflows shown in Figure~\\ref{image-large-scale}.

Two other examples are the outflows associated with PSR J1101--6101 (the Lighthouse Nebula; Pavan et al.\\ 2014) and PSR J2055+2539 (Marelli et al.\\ 2015).  The former one shows a particularly remarkable structure.\nThe deep 300 ks {\\sl Chandra\\ } ACIS image of the Lighthouse Nebula shown in Figure \\ref{image-lighthouse} reveals a long ($\\sim 11$ pc) jet-like outflow that originates near the pulsar, bends back in the direction opposite to that of the pulsars' proper motion, and then sharply turns in a direction nearly orthogonal to the proper motion direction (see also Pavan et al.\\ 2015).  \nThis outflow can possibly be interpreted in the framework of the Bandiera (2008) scenario, similar to Guitar and J1509 misaligned outflows.  The shape of the outflow near the pulsar can be explained by ``draping'' of the ISM magnetic field (see Lyutikov 2006 and Dursi \\& Pfrommer 2008 for discussion of magnetic draping associated with galaxy clusters).\nIn this scenario, the external magnetic field lines, draped around the bow shock, are being illuminated by the escaping wind particles traveling along the draped magnetic field.  Note that this outflow is rather faint near the pulsar, similar to J1509.  \nAdditionally, the PWN of PSR B0355+54 also shows hints of a misaligned outflow (see Figure \\ref{bowshocks}), although in this case it is rather faint and is seen on both sides of the bow shock (perhaps due to the lower speed of the pulsar).  An in-depth discussion of this PWN will be given in a separate paper (Klingler et al., in prep.). \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{f14.png}\n\\caption{Merged image based on 194 ks of {\\sl Chandra\\ } ACIS-S observations of PSR B2224+65 (the Guitar Nebula).
