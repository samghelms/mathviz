The {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ experiment located at {\\mbox{\\textsc{Lngs}}}\\ is searching for the\n{$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$}\\ decay of {$^{76}$Ge}. It is equipped with an active muon veto the main part\nof which is a water Cherenkov veto with 66~PMTs in the {water tank}\\ surrounding the\n{\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ cryostat.

The\n{\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ experiment is searching for the neutrinoless double beta ({$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$}) decay\nof $^{76}$Ge~\\cite{gerda_tec, gerda_prl}. The experimental signature of the\n{$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$}\\ decay is a peak at {$Q_{\\beta\\beta}$}, the $Q$ value of the decay.\n\n{\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ was constructed in the underground laboratory of Laboratori Nazionali\ndel Gran Sasso ({\\mbox{\\textsc{Lngs}}}) of {\\textsc{Infn}}\\ in Italy, which offers an overburden of 3500\nmeter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of rock and hence a reduction of the muon flux\nby a factor of $\\sim$10$^6$ to a rate of\n$\\sim$3.4$\\times10^{-4}$/(s$\\cdot$m$^2$). This remaining muon flux however is\nsufficient to cause a non-negligible background in the region of interest\naround {$Q_{\\beta\\beta}$}=2039~keV when increasing the sensitivity beyond\n{${T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}}$}$>\n", "index": 1, "text": "$$10^{25}$~yr or when requesting a background index BI$<${$10^{-2}$~cts/(keV$\\cdot$kg$\\cdot$yr)}.\nHowever, also other analyses profit from the reduced backgrounds (see\ne.g. Ref.~\\cite{majoron,now}).\n\nThe origin of muons at {\\mbox{\\textsc{Lngs}}}\\ for Phase~I of {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ was twofold. Firstly, the\nmajority of the detectable mu\\-ons are produced cosmogenically. Spectrum and\nangular distribution of the muons are both altered by the profile of the rock\noverburden and have been measured for {\\mbox{\\textsc{Lngs}}}\\ with high\nprecision~\\cite{macro_mu_93}. These muons have an average energy of $\\langle\nE_\\upmu\\rangle=270$~GeV. Secondly, a source for muons was the \\textsc{Cngs}\nneutrino beam from \\textsc{Cern}~\\cite{cngs13} which created muons via\ne.g. $\\nu_\\upmu + d \\rightarrow \\upmu^- + u$ reactions in the vicinity of the\ndetector. This contribution amounted to 2.2\\,\\% of the total muon flux in\n{\\textsc{Gerda}}. As the \\textsc{Cngs} was shut down after 2012 the future Phase~II of\n{\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ will be unaffected. In order to reduce muon induced background, a muon\nveto comprised of a water Cherenkov veto and a scintillator veto was\nimplemented to tag muons and to use its response as a veto signal in the\n{$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$}\\ analysis.\n\nThis paper describes the hardware and setup of the veto and the DAQ\nsystem. The performance of the veto will be presented and compared to Monte\nCarlo simulations. Detection and rejection efficiencies for the veto will be\ndiscussed. Parts of this work have been published during the respective PhD\nperiods~\\cite{knapp_phd,ritter_phd,freund_phd,mubuild,mucalib}.\n\n\\section{Instrumentation}\nHere, a technical description of the apparatus is given. Purpose and function\nof both parts of the veto, Cheren\\-kov and scintillator panels, is\nintroduced. The trigger logic, calibration and data acquisition are\nsummarized.\n\\subsection{\\textsc{Gerda}}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{fig01_cryostat_v12.pdf}\n\\caption{  \\label{fig:sketch}\n         A sketch of the \\textsc{Gerda} experiment.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nIn \\textsc{Gerda} an array of bare germanium detectors is operated in a\ncryostat that contains 64~m$^3$ of liquid argon (LAr) as seen in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:sketch}. The cryostat is surrounded by a {water tank}\\ with a diameter of\n10~m and a height of 9.4~m that is filled with 590~t ultra-pure water; its\nwalls are covered with a reflective foil. The cryostat has a connection (neck)\nthrough the {water tank}\\ to the clean room above from which the germanium detectors\nare lowered into the LAr. Both {water tank}\\ and cryostat are part of the innovative\nshielding design of {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ where low-Z materials are used in order to reduce\ncosmogenic activation~\\cite{gerda_tec,heusser}.\n\nThe \\textsc{Gerda} muon veto consists of two independent parts which are read\nout by the same DAQ. The first and main part is a water Cherenkov veto that\ndetects the Cherenkov radiation of the traversing muons. Thus, the {water tank}\\ is\ninstrumented with 66 encapsulated photomultipliers (PMTs). The second part of\nthe muon veto is comprised of plastic scintillator panels. Since the\nCherenkov veto offers reduced tagging capability at or around the neck of the\ncryostat, plastic panels were placed on top of the clean room in order to\nclose this weak spot in the Cherenkov veto.\n\n\\subsection{The Cherenkov veto}\nBelow the water level there are 66 PMTs (8'' size) of type 9354KB/9350KB by\nETL~\\cite{935x} installed. In order to protect the PMTs from the surrounding\nwater, each PMT is housed in a stainless-steel encapsulation which is further\ndeveloped from the design of the {\\mbox{\\textsc{Borexino}}}\\ capsules~\\cite{bor_cap}. The\ncapsule of low radioactivity stainless-steel~\\cite{raff} is closed with a\ncustom made PET cap and is filled with IR spectroscopy oil~\\cite{sigma}. The\noil keeps the optical transition between PET cap and PMT as smooth as\npossible. Thus, efficiency losses by total internal reflections are\nminimized. The bottom of the base of the PMT is encased in polyurethane\n\\cite{electro} and sealed with silicon gel~\\cite{wacker}. The lower part of\nthe PMT, i.e. the dynode structure, is protected from magnetic fields by a\ncone of $\\upmu$-metal~\\cite{mumet}. Each capsule is equipped with an optical\nfibre for optical calibration pulses from outside the {water tank}. To keep the number\nof cables and connectors within the clean water at a minimum an underwater\nhigh-voltage cable~\\cite{jowo} connects the PMT to a signal splitter outside\nof the {water tank}. This band-pass separates the signal from the high voltage\n(HV). The former is digitized and stored on disk upon a trigger\n(sec.~\\ref{sec:daq}). The HV is supplied by a HV multichannel system by\nCAEN~\\cite{1527} equipped with six 12-channel boards \\cite{1733}.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{fig02_pmtscheme.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:capsule}\n      Parts of a PMT capsule\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n A sketch of\nthe capsule is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:capsule} and images of the components of\nthe Cherenkov veto are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:vetopix}.\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig03a_pic_capsule.jpg}~\n    \\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig03b_pic_fibre.jpg}\\\\\n    \\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig03c_pic_diffball.jpg}~\n    \\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig03d_pic_pillbox.jpg}\n  \\caption{   \\label{fig:vetopix}\n      Images of the components of the Cherenkov veto during the\n       installation.

The violet\n        area on the bottom plate signifies the circumference of the cryostat\n        and the gaps show the position of manholes into the pillbox. The other\n        three violet areas show the location of the manhole into the\n        cryostat. All cables and fibres are lead out of the {water tank}\\ through three\n        50~cm flanges mounted in a ``chimney'' above the water level (\n        Fig.~\\ref{fig:sketch})\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nThe PMTs are arranged in seven rings in the {water tank}, their distribution is shown\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:distrib}. One ring of six PMTs (101-106) is pointing inside\nthe separate volume under the cryostat (commonly referred to as ``pillbox''),\ntwo rings of eight PMTs (201-208) and 12 PMTs (301-312) respectively are\nplaced on the bottom of the {water tank}\\ looking upwards and four rings of 10 PMTs are\nplaced on the wall (401-710), pointing horizontally towards the cryostat. The\nnumber of PMTs and their placement was chosen after an extensive Monte Carlo\nstudy~\\cite{knapp_phd}. The PMTs closest to the cryostat, i.e those from the\npillbox and the inner ring on the bottom, were selected according to their\nperformance and radioactivity (type 9354KB is a low activity module). However,\ndue to the distance to the germanium detectors and the low overall mass the\nradioactivity of the muon veto is negligible compared to the one of the\nstainless steel cryostat~\\cite{knapp_phd}.\n\nThe floor and the walls of the {water tank}\\ and of the cryostat are covered with the\nreflective Daylighting Film DF2000MA (commonly known as\n``VM2000'')~\\cite{vm2000} which offers a reflectivity of $>$99\\% in order to\nincrease the light yield of each event.\nThis comes at the cost of a reduction in tracking capabilities of each\nindividual muon. The reflective foil does not only increase the collected\nlight yield of each muon, but it acts as a wave-length shifter as well. It\nshifts the predominantly ultra-violet Cherenkov photons to around 400~nm where\nthe PMTs are most efficient. The efficiency of a 9354KB type PMT and the\nwave-length shifting effect implemented in the \\textsc{Geant4} simulations are\nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:pmteff}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig05_pmteff_ref.pdf}\n\\caption{   \\label{fig:pmteff}\n    Efficiency (red curve) of a 9354KB type PMT adapted from\n    Ref.~\\cite{935x}  and simulated photon spectrum with wave-length\n    shifting effect (blue histogram)\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig06_diffball.png}\n  \\caption{   \\label{fig:diffball}\n   Schematic drawing of a diffuser ball after\n   Ref.~\\cite{mucalib}\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nThe PMTs are calibrated regularly with a set of five custom made diffuser\nballs shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:diffball} which are constructed to provide a\nlight source as isotropic as possible. These are glass balls with a diameter\nof 4.5~cm that are filled with a mixture of silicon gel~\\cite{wacker} and\nglass pearls~\\cite{pearls} with a diameter of $\\sim$50~{$\\upmu$m}. An optical fibre\nis glued into a small vial inside the ball with a higher content of glass\npearls. The cladding at the end of the fibre is removed and the fibre is\nroughened in order to obtain a diffuse light emission. Ultra-fast LEDs outside\nof the water tank can be pulsed to illuminate the five diffuser balls\n\\cite{mucalib}. Four of these balls are distributed in the main {water tank}\\ and a\nfifth is placed inside the ``pillbox''. With an appropriate setting of the\nLEDs it is possible to illuminate all PMTs simultaneously with single photons\nand thus record single-photon responses of every PMT at the same time. As the\ndiffuser balls are working very well, the calibration fibres attached to every\nPMT are currently not in use.\n\n\\subsection{Scintillator Veto}\nMuons passing through the neck of the cryostat may either traverse a too short\ndistance in the ``pillbox'' or in the {water tank}\\ to be detected. In order to keep\nthe muon rejection efficiency as high as possible, a veto of plastic\nscintillator panels was conceived and installed.\n\nEach scintillator panel contains a $200\\times50\\times3$~cm$^3$ sheet of\nplastic scintillator based on polystyrol with an addition of PTP (2\\,\\%) and\nPOPOP (0.03\\,\\%)~\\cite{scint}. In addition the panels contain optical\nfibres~\\cite{fibre} on the narrow sides as light-guides, an electronics board\nwith a trigger and shaper and a PMT. Half of the panels are equipped with PMTs\nby Hamamatsu Photonics~\\cite{ppmt} and the other half with PMT-085 by\nKvadrotech. The PMT-085 are powered by the same HV supply as the muon veto\nPMTs however connecting 3 PMTs to one HV output. The front-end electronics,\nthe Hamamatsu PMTs and all other components are powered by a custom made power\nsource with +12~V and $\\pm$6~V.\n\nThe panels are arranged in three layers covering an area of $4\\times3$~m$^2$\ncentered over the neck of the cryostat. It was aimed to keep both trigger rate\nand thus data volume of the veto as low as possible. Therefore, the trigger is\na triple coincidence of all three layers since this option offers a high\ndiscrimination against non-muonic background events in the panels such as\n{$\\gamma$}\\ rays from environmental radioactivity. Thus, the scintillator veto\nrecords an almost pure muon sample. Individually, each panel shows a\npulse-height distribution which takes the form of a Landau peak. Despite the\ntriple coincidence, small {$\\gamma$}\\ contamination at low pulse heights\nremains. These events can be discarded with a product cut of the form\n\\begin{equation}(x_1-\\rho_1)(x_2-\\rho_2)<c\\label{eq:eq1}\n\\end{equation}\nfor the pulse heights $x_{1,2}$ of any pair of panels in the stack and constants\n$\\rho_{1,2}$ and $c$. The 2-D pulse height distribution of two panels in a\nstack, the applied cut and a spectrum of a single panel with a fit to the\nLandau peak is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:panscat}.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig07_panel_scatter_lan.pdf}\n\\caption{   \\label{fig:panscat}\n     Scatter plot of the pulse height maxima of two panels in a triple stack\n     with a  product cut (red line) as given in Eq.~\\ref{eq:eq1}. The inset\n     shows the pulse height distribution of one panel and a Landau-fit (red)\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Data acquisition\\label{sec:daq}}\nThe entire apparatus is read out and operated by a VME data acquisition system\n(DAQ) which is almost identical to the one of the germanium DAQ (see\nRef.~\\cite{gerda_tec} for details). Ten Flash-ADCs~\\cite{struck} with 8\nchannels each digitize the input signals of the Cherenkov veto with 100~MHz.\nThe signals in each channel are processed by a trapezoidal filter and if the\nheight exceeds the threshold set to 0.5 photo-electrons (p.e.)  an internal\ntrigger is generated. Each FADC module has one trigger output which is the\nlogic OR of the internal triggers of its eight channels.  Thus, the PMT\nsignals are connected to the input channels in such a way over the FADCs, that\nneighboring PMTs are always read out by different FADCs.  This allows the\nproper detection of clustered events in which PMTs next to each other have\nfired. The final trigger condition is set such that five FADCs must trigger on\nat least 0.5 photo-electrons (p.e.) each within 60~ns.  That signal is\nrealized by a FPGA and it starts the readout of all traces covering a period\nof 4~{$\\upmu$s}. These are stored together with the time stamp, lately from a GPS\nclock.  A schematic drawing of the entire muon veto and its data flow is shown\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:daqscheme}.  The trigger signal is furthermore sent to the\ngermanium DAQ recording it as a redundant but immediate veto information for\nthe germanium data stream.\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=.46\\textwidth]{fig08_daqschemebw.pdf}\n  \\caption{    \\label{fig:daqscheme}\n         Schematic drawing of the data acquisition (DAQ) setup\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe scintillator panels are arranged in three layers of 12 panels each. Three\nadditional FADCs of the same type digitize the signal of the scintillator\nveto. The signals of two non-neighboring panels within a layer are multiplexed\nonto one FADC channel using custom made reflection-free modules with an\namplification of -6~dB. Thus the 36 panels occupy only 18 FADC channels such\nthat each layer is read out by one FADC module.  The panel stack which was hit\ncan be determined by the unique combination of fired channels. The same\ntrigger logic as for the Cherenkov veto is applied for the panels, albeit the\ntrigger window is larger in order to accommodate the much longer output\nsignals of the panel PMTs because they are shaped with a larger time\nconstant. For a panel event, all three FADCs (i.e. all three panels in a\nstack) need to have fired. Both types of trigger signals are accepted during\ndata taking.\n\nFor a calibration run of the PMTs, the standard data taking is stopped. The\nultra-fast calibration LEDs are activated with a pulser and the LED luminosity\nis controlled by a current source in form of a digital-to-analog\nconverter~\\cite{dac}. A separate FADC reads out the pulser signal and triggers\nthe entire veto for each pulse.\n\nTwo calibration spectra can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:calib}. One is showing\nthe conventionally recorded single-photon peak (SPP) set to channel 100, the\nother comes from a too bright LED setting. This causes a contamination of the\nSPP by the double photon peak (DPP) and a shift of the amplitudes of both\npeaks to higher values. The SPP emerges very well in most PMTs and\npeak-to-valley ratios between 1.2 and 3.0 are observed.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig09_calib_spp_dpp.pdf}\n  \\caption{      \\label{fig:calib}\n       Cherenkov PMT response with different forward voltages of the\n       calibration LEDs, i.e. luminosities. With a low luminosity, only the\n       single photon peak (SPP, broken green line) is visible, if the\n       luminosity is too high, the double photon peak (DPP, blue) emerges as\n       well. The pedestal is shown in red\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Veto performance}\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{fig10_dutycycle.pdf}\n  \\caption{    \\label{fig:duty}\n       Duty cycle of the muon veto. The veto uptime (black) and accumulated\n       live days (red) are marked as well as the {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ physics runs for\n       Phase~I (filled light red and green)\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nThe \\textsc{Gerda} muon veto was installed in 2009 and its operation started\nin November 2010. During the germanium commissioning runs the panel veto was\ninstalled so that the complete veto was operational at the start of the\nphysics runs of \\textsc{Gerda} in November 2011. Until July 2013, 805.6 live\ndays have been recorded and 491 days of combined muon-germanium data. The duty\ncycle is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:duty} together with the accumulated live time\n(red line). During Phase~I the muon DAQ was only stopped during breaks of the\ngermanium data taking in order to perform short maintenance work and to\ncalibrate the PMTs by adjusting the HV of each PMT so that each module shows\nthe same response to single photons. The PMTs were very stable and since the\nbeginning only few PMTs needed to be readjusted. As example the daily light\noutput per day is shown for selected seven PMTs in Fig.~\\ref{fig:stabil}. The\noffsets are for display only. For e.g. PMT101 there was no readjustment\nnecessary since May 2011, while PMT301 needed several tunings of the\nHV. However, between the breaks the light output remains stable.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{fig11_pmtstability.pdf}\n  \\caption{      \\label{fig:stabil}\n       Summary of the stability of the light output of selected PMTs; note the\n       arbitrary offsets. The hatched areas indicate maintenance periods\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nDuring the germanium data taking the muon veto was always fully operational.\n\nDuring Phase~I two PMTs were lost due to implosion of the tube (PMTs 401 \\&\n604). The implosion was mostly contained by the encapsulation and no other\nPMTs in the vicinity were harmed. The implosions happened in February and\nApril 2012 and the PMTs were over 10~m apart. Hence a direct influence can be\nruled out. A third PMT was lost right after installation due to a punctured\ncable (PMT 305) and a fourth PMT ceased working during the installation and\ncould be immediately exchanged (PMT 203). In July 2013, the {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ {water tank}\\ was\ndrained, the veto inspected and two of these PMTs were successfully exchanged\n(PMTs 305 \\& 401). All other PMTs still work as intended and showed little to\nno signs of deterioration.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation studies}\nThe performance of the muon veto was simulated with the\n\\textsc{Geant4}-based~\\cite{geant4} framework for \\textsc{Gerda} and\n\\textsc{Majorana} ({\\textsc{MaGe}})~\\cite{MaGe}. First, the simulations were used to find\ninitial placements and efficiencies~\\cite{knapp_phd} and repeated once the\nexact geometries of the apparatus were finalized~\\cite{freund_phd}. The muon\nspectra provided by the \\textsc{Macro} experiment were used as input for the\nsimulation of cosmogenic muons~\\cite{macro_mu_93}. The simulations were mainly\nused to determine the efficiency of the apparatus in case the muon caused any\nenergy deposition in the germanium crystals.\n\nFor the efficiency of the Cherenkov veto the simulation was undertaken in two\nparts. Firstly, muons were simulated with the Cherenkov effect switched\noff. The primary vertices of those muons that caused energy deposition in the\ngermanium detectors were extracted from these events. Secondly, these selected\nmuons were used in a second simulation with Cherenkov effect enabled. This\ntwo-step procedure was applied in order to accelerate the simulation as only a\nminute fraction of the muons interact with the germanium detectors and because\nthe simulation of optical photons is a resource-demanding procedure. A\ndetection efficiency for the veto was derived by determining the fraction of\nenergy depositing muons which caused a trigger signal in the muon veto. The\ntrigger condition were the same as for the muon veto DAQ described in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:daq}. For the entire veto a detection efficiency of\n\\begin{equation}\n\\varepsilon_{\\upmu d}^\\mathrm{MC}= (99.935\\pm0.015)\\% \\label{eq:simeff}\n\\end{equation}\nfor muons with energy deposition in the germanium detectors was found in the\nsimulated data. \n\nBy removing certain PMTs from the efficiency calculations, a veto degradation\n(e.g. possibly broken PMTs or malfunctioning FADCs) was\nsimulated. Even with the first two FADCs removed (14 PMTs in total, two in each\nof the seven rings shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:distrib}), the\nefficiency is still (99.525$^{+0.025}_{-0.035}$)\\%. However when only four PMTs\nin the pillbox  are removed the value drops to (97.855$\\pm0.065$)\\%. The\npillbox PMTs can hence be considered the most critical ones in case of a\nbreak-down. \n\nThe light produced inside the pillbox can illuminate the main {water tank}\\ through two\nsmall manholes. However, the light coming from these two holes is not\nsufficient in order to generate a trigger. The insensitivity against a loss of\na few PMTs gives high reliability of the efficiency of the veto against small\nvariations of trigger conditions or changes in the amplitude of the PMTs.\n\nIn an earlier work the efficiency was estimated as $\\varepsilon_{\\upmu\n  d}^\\mathrm{MC}=(99.56\\pm0.42)$\\,\\% and thus some what lower despite lower\ntrigger conditions~\\cite{knapp_phd}. The previous simulation neglected the\noptical connection between the ``pillbox'' volume and the main\n{water tank}\\ completely. Several other simulation studies have been performed like the\nveto response to regular cosmogenic muons which are shown and compared to\nexperimental data in the next sections.\n\n\\subsection{Multiplicity and photon spectra}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.48\\textwidth]{fig12_ph_spec.pdf}\n\\caption{     \\label{fig:lenght}\n       Photo-electron spectra for all cosmogenic muons (top) and those with\n       energy deposition in the germanium detectors (bottom). In each panel\n       the total recorded p.e. spectrum (red) is compared to the spectrum\n       which is recorded just in the pillbox (green). Spectra derived from\n       simulations (blue) are normalized to the same exposure\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nThe light yield of a single muon is determined by observing the total number\nof recorded p.e. in all PMTs. For comparison, the pillbox is treated as an\nindividual volume. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:lenght} histograms of the recorded and\nsimulated events are shown for the period of Phase~I. In the spectra for the\ncosmogenic muons, apart from the very low light yield there are maxima at\nabout 167~p.e. in the pillbox data and about 605~p.e. for the total\nspectrum. These broad peaks correspond to the mean traversed distance of 1.8~m\nfor the pillbox and of 9~m for the {water tank}\\ for muons with a mean incident angle\nof $60^{\\circ}$. Light from muons in the {water tank}\\ is subject to attenuation, the\nattenuation length of photons in water being $\\sim$10~m. Assuming a mean\ndistance of 5~m of the PMTs from the muon track in the {water tank}\\ and 2~m in the\npillbox, muons of any track deposit approximately the same amount of\nlight. Thus, each muon generates $(115\\pm39)$ p.e./m. This is reproduced by\nthe simulation.\n\nA peak structure is visible in the data for muons which deposit energy in the\ngermanium detectors as well. The peak for the pillbox is at slightly lower\np.e. values because the average incident zenith angle is lower and thus the\ntrack length shorter. The p.e. spectrum for all PMTs shows a double peak\nfeature. This is due to the fact that the muon has to cross the cryostat in\norder to deposit energy in the germanium. The muon can deposit light in the\n{water tank}\\ before and after interacting with the germanium detectors. The higher\npeak corresponds to muons which pass the tank twice and the smaller\ncorresponds to muons that pass the {water tank}\\ just once (e.g. shallow angles close\nto the neck of the cryostat). Again, the simulations agree with this even\nthough the double peak structure is less pronounced.\n\nAnother characteristic of a muon event is the number of fired PMTs. This\nmultiplicity $M$ is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:mult} for several classes of muon\nevents. The spectrum of all measured events (green line) shows a peak at\n$M$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"(x_{1}-\\rho_{1})(x_{2}-\\rho_{2})&lt;c\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05935.tex", "nexttext": ">$60.

Due to insensitive areas at the panel borders\n(scintillator edges, encasing) the effective area of the panels is reduced by\n$\\sim$5~mm per border or less than $<0.25$\\% of the area.\n\n\\subsection{Low multiplicity enhancement \\label{sec:bump}}\nThe enhancement at low multiplicities is characterized by a very low number of\nrecorded photo-electrons (in most cases one or two p.e. per PMT) without any\nobservable clustering effects and amounts to about 8.7\\% of the overall\nCherenkov activity (i.e. $3.1\\times10^{-3}$/s). This behavior suggests a very\nfaint source of light inside the {water tank}\\ that is not directly caused by\nmuons. Events which trigger the panel veto and can hence be considered true\nmuon events do not show this anomaly. It was already suggested that this\nanomaly is caused by scintillation of the reflective foil under irradiation by\n$\\alpha$ sources in the stainless steel of the\n{water tank}~\\cite{gerda_tec,ritter_phd}. The foil has a highly reflective front side\nand is covered with an adhesive on the back side. According to the\nmanufacturer the foil itself has a thickness of 66~{$\\upmu$m}\\ and the adhesive a\nthickness of 38~{$\\upmu$m}~\\cite{vm2000}. If the adhesive can be assumed to be an\norganic compound a mean free path of $\\sim$30~{$\\upmu$m}\\ for a 5~MeV $\\alpha$\nparticle is expected.  Hence it is unlikely that $\\alpha$ particles coming\nfrom the back side are able to deposit energy in the foil and produce\nscintillation photons which can exit the foil on the front side. This was\ntested by illuminating the foil with an $^{241}$Am $\\alpha$ source and by\nrecording the scintillation light on the front side with a 9235Q PMT. When the\nfoil was illuminated from the back side, i.e. through the adhesive, almost no\nadditional light was recorded. When the adhesive was removed from the back\nside the same measurement yielded a small effect. If illuminated on the front\nside sufficient photons were recorded which could explain the enhancement if\napplied to the conditions in the {water tank}. However, this suggests that the $\\alpha$\nsource is either solved in the ultra-pure water or adhering to the front side\nof the foil. The activity of water from this plant was measured to have an\noverall $\\alpha$ activity in the range of\n10$^{-6}$--10$^{-7}$~Bq/kg~\\cite{water} and measurements of {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ water\nsamples agree with these values~\\cite{gerdawater}. This activity is too low to\nexplain these excess events. If the front side of the foil had a radon\ncontamination, a higher rate would have been expected after the opening of the\n{water tank}. A higher rate was indeed measured but this was in accordance to a higher\ndark rate after prolonged exposure to light of the Cherenkov PMTs.\n \nAnother explanation for the origin of this anomaly are $\\beta$ sources since\nelectrons have much higher specific ranges in comparison to\n$\\alpha$ particles. The stainless steel of the {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ {water tank}\\ exhibits \na low level of radioactivity and one of the strongest contribution to\nthe radionuclides in the steel is the $\\beta$ emitter $^{60}$Co with an\nactivity of $\\sim$20~mBq/kg~\\cite{gerdasteel} which leads to a $^{60}$Co\nactivity on the surface of the {water tank}\\ of $\\sim$5~Bq.

A cut on the Cherenkov events of $M\\geq$20 was\nchosen which discards unphysical events at low $M$.  The pre-selection of muon\nevents by the Cherenkov veto is necessary because the standard trigger of the\nplastic veto can not be used. For the panels a simple cut on the pulse heights\nis insufficient due to the {$\\gamma$}\\ coincidences at low pulse heights (see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:panscat}). In addition to the pulse height cut defined by the\ntrigger threshold, a cut on the product of two pulse heights in the form of\nEq.~\\ref{eq:eq1} was applied. The detection efficiency of one panel can now be\ngiven as the ratio of events, in which the top and bottom panel of a stack\nhave fired in comparison to the events where all three panels in a stack have\nfired.\n\nThe data set contained events since the beginning of the muon data taking with\nthe panels in August 2011. In this set, 30~044 events were found which\ntriggered the top and bottom panel. Of these events 29~951 triggered the third\npanel as well. This leads to an average muon detection efficiency per panel\nof:\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\varepsilon_{\\upmu d}^\\mathrm{P}= (99.70^{+0.03}_{-0.05})\\%\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\varepsilon_{\\upmu d}^{\\mathrm{P}}=(99.70^{+0.03}_{-0.05})\\%\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03b5</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mn>99.70</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>0.03</mn></mrow></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo lspace=\"0pt\" rspace=\"3.5pt\">%</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05935.tex", "nexttext": "\nWith this efficiency, the activity expected from $^{60}$Co from the steel is\nreduced to $\\sim$0.6/s which is still too high in comparison to the measured\nrate.

In addition, the cosmogenic components of the background in\n\\textsc{Gerda} was systematically identified, analyzed and compared to Monte\nCarlo simulations.\n\nThe hardware thresholds were chosen in a way, that by design a very pure muon\nsample is recorded with only a few percent contamination by random\ncoincidences or other sources of background. With this powerful muon veto over\ntwo years of data have been recorded including the 491~days coincident with\nthe germanium detectors.\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulations of earlier works were extended to accommodate for\na more realistic set-up of the muon veto. PMT multiplicity and p.e.  spectra\nwere found in good agreement with the data and the light deposition of\ncosmogenic and energy-depositing muons could be related to their different\ntrack-lengths in the water tank. With the updated geometry a detection\nefficiency of $\\varepsilon^{\\textrm{sim}}_{\\upmu d}=(99.935\\pm0.015)$\\% was\nfound for the simulated energy-depositing muons in the {water tank}.\n\nThe muon events in the germanium detectors were studied in detail. A cut on\nthe signals of the germanium detectors was defined that identifies muon\nhits. From comparison to coincident muon events a rejection efficiency of\n$\\varepsilon_{\\upmu r}=(99.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4})$\\% was found. The events would have\nproduced a background index of\n$\\textrm{BI}_{\\upmu}=(3.16\\pm0.85)\\times\\textrm{{$10^{-3}$~cts/(keV$\\cdot$kg$\\cdot$yr)}}$.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nThe work of the T\\\"ubingen group within the {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ experiment is supported by\nthe grants 05CDVT1/8, 05A08VT1, 05A11VT3 and 05A14VT2 provided by\nthe BMBF/PT-DESY.\n\nSpecial thanks goes to the mechanical and electronic workshops in T\\\"ubingen\nfor their assistance during the preparation of the Cherenkov veto.

The efficiency of a triple stack\nof panels is hence $(\\varepsilon_{\\upmu d}^\\mathrm{P})^3 =\n(99.10^{+0.09}_{-0.15})$\\%. Due to insensitive areas at the panel borders\n(scintillator edges, encasing) the effective area of the panels is reduced by\n$\\sim$5~mm per border or less than $<0.25$\\% of the area.\n\n\\subsection{Low multiplicity enhancement \\label{sec:bump}}\nThe enhancement at low multiplicities is characterized by a very low number of\nrecorded photo-electrons (in most cases one or two p.e. per PMT) without any\nobservable clustering effects and amounts to about 8.7\\% of the overall\nCherenkov activity (i.e. $3.1\\times10^{-3}$/s). This behavior suggests a very\nfaint source of light inside the {water tank}\\ that is not directly caused by\nmuons. Events which trigger the panel veto and can hence be considered true\nmuon events do not show this anomaly. It was already suggested that this\nanomaly is caused by scintillation of the reflective foil under irradiation by\n$\\alpha$ sources in the stainless steel of the\n{water tank}~\\cite{gerda_tec,ritter_phd}. The foil has a highly reflective front side\nand is covered with an adhesive on the back side. According to the\nmanufacturer the foil itself has a thickness of 66~{$\\upmu$m}\\ and the adhesive a\nthickness of 38~{$\\upmu$m}~\\cite{vm2000}. If the adhesive can be assumed to be an\norganic compound a mean free path of $\\sim$30~{$\\upmu$m}\\ for a 5~MeV $\\alpha$\nparticle is expected.  Hence it is unlikely that $\\alpha$ particles coming\nfrom the back side are able to deposit energy in the foil and produce\nscintillation photons which can exit the foil on the front side. This was\ntested by illuminating the foil with an $^{241}$Am $\\alpha$ source and by\nrecording the scintillation light on the front side with a 9235Q PMT. When the\nfoil was illuminated from the back side, i.e. through the adhesive, almost no\nadditional light was recorded. When the adhesive was removed from the back\nside the same measurement yielded a small effect. If illuminated on the front\nside sufficient photons were recorded which could explain the enhancement if\napplied to the conditions in the {water tank}. However, this suggests that the $\\alpha$\nsource is either solved in the ultra-pure water or adhering to the front side\nof the foil. The activity of water from this plant was measured to have an\noverall $\\alpha$ activity in the range of\n10$^{-6}$--10$^{-7}$~Bq/kg~\\cite{water} and measurements of {\\textsc{Gerda}}\\ water\nsamples agree with these values~\\cite{gerdawater}. This activity is too low to\nexplain these excess events. If the front side of the foil had a radon\ncontamination, a higher rate would have been expected after the opening of the\n{water tank}. A higher rate was indeed measured but this was in accordance to a higher\ndark rate after prolonged exposure to light of the Cherenkov PMTs.\n \nAnother explanation for the origin of this anomaly are $\\beta$ sources since\nelectrons have much higher specific ranges in comparison to\n$\\alpha$ particles.
