We propose a formula to modify this estimator, based on the use of the structure function. To verify the presence of the cosmological effect and the reliability of the proposed correction, we use data extracted from the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue, data release 5 (XMMSSC-DR5), and cross-matched with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalogue, of data release 7 and 12.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\nActive galactic nuclei are bright sources shining both in the local and the high redshift Universe. These objects share a number of characteristic properties among which variability.\nFlux variations occur in the whole electromagnetic spectrum and act on many timescales, in the case of the X-ray domain, from fraction of a day up to several years.\nStudies concerning the AGN variability in the X-ray domain are of great importance in order to constrain the physics of the inner part of these sources. \nOften variability studies have been produced using the so-called normalised excess variance (NXS) estimator (e.g. [1, 2]), while only few ensemble studies based on the structure function (SF) are available, e.g. [3].\nThe NXS is a very popular method but it has been pointed out that it depends on the duration of the light curves [4].\nWe demonstrate that this method can not be used in a naive way. It is affected by the cosmological time dilation, so that, when used for a wide range of redshifts, it can lead to erroneous variability estimations.\n\n\n\\section{Variability estimators}\n\nThe NXS provides a straightforward way to characterize the mean variability of a single source.

The XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue (XMMSSC DR5) [6] contains a large number of X-ray detections (565,962) for 396,910 single sources achieved between 2000 and 2013. In this catalogue to each observation is associated a warning flag (SUM\\_FLAG), summarizing its photometric quality. We discard all detections labelled with SUM\\_FLAG$>$2 i.e. suggesting that the observation has a high probability to be artifact and unreliable.\nTo extract only quasar observations we take advantage of the 7th [7] and the 12th [8] data releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar catalogues. These catalogues as well as the XMMSSC DR5 contain  for each observation the equatorial coordinates, $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$. This allows us to cross-match the catalogues by coordinates, thus to extract only quasar data from the serendipitous X-ray detections.\nWe consider a match when an XMMSSC observation lies within 5 arcsec in both $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ from an observation listed in any of the two SDSS quasar catalogues.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics [width=4.5in]{points.png}\n\t\t\t\\caption{NXS estimates of our sources as a function of the number of epochs (NEPO).

Referring to Eq.~1, it might be possible to obtain $\\sigma_{NXS}^2<0$ when the mean squared error is larger than the variance. In such cases we discard the NXS estimates, because the variability information provided is embedded into the noise, so reducing the sample to 1,775 sources. Furthermore, since the NXS parameter is an averaged estimate of the source variability, it is desirable to increase the number of measurements used to compute NXS. The computed $\\sigma_{NXS}^2$ will better approximate the intrinsic NXS of the source when a large number of data is used. However, only few sources are observed several times so that, in this work we used a subsample containing 416 sources observed at least four times, the red points in Fig.~2. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Trend and correction}\n\n\n\nWe report in Fig.~3 (blue points) the NXS estimates computed according to Eq.~1.\nThe linear least squares fit to these estimates shows how the cosmic time dilation acts on the NXS, yielding a $\\sigma_{NXS}^2\\propto \\Delta t_{rest}^{0.21\\pm0.04}$.

The SF ensemble analysis, indeed, characterizes the variability of a large number of sources as a function of the lag $\\tau$ between two observations. Eq.~5 describes how $\\sigma_{NXS}^2$ depends on the duration of the light curve in the rest-frame, $\\Delta t_{rest}$, and it allows us to extrapolate the expected variability for a certain source at a certain time lag.

The SF ensemble analysis, indeed, characterizes the variability of a large number of sources as a function of the lag $\\tau$ between two observations. Eq.~5 describes how $\\sigma_{NXS}^2$ depends on the duration of the light curve in the rest-frame, $\\Delta t_{rest}$, and it allows us to extrapolate the expected variability for a certain source at a certain time lag. In order to compare the variability of sources characterized by shorter light curves with those objects having longer light curves, we normalize Eq.~5 to a given time interval $\\Delta t^*$ that can be freely chosen:\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\sigma_{NXS}^{2~*}=\\sigma^2_{NXS}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t^*}{\\Delta t_{rest}}\\right)^{2\\beta}=\\sigma^2_{NXS}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t^*}{\\Delta t_{obs}}\\right)^{2\\beta}(1+z)^{2\\beta}~.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\sigma_{NXS}^{2~{}*}=\\sigma^{2}_{NXS}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t^{*}}{\\Delta t_{rest}%&#10;}\\right)^{2\\beta}=\\sigma^{2}_{NXS}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t^{*}}{\\Delta t_{obs}}%&#10;\\right)^{2\\beta}(1+z)^{2\\beta}~{}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>2</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2063</mo><mo>*</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
