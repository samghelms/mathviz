Lagrangian contains a mixing term\nwith $\\chi$ - the mixing parameter for a given mass $m_{\\gamma '}$\nof a HP \\cite{Holdom} which determines the probability of HP-photon\nconversion by which HP can be ``seen'' in experiment. Recently the\neV mass range of HP CDM was investigated with a dish antenna\n\\cite{Suzuki} a novel method proposed in \\cite{Horns}. The method\nsuggests detection of a reflected from metallic mirror (antenna)\nelectromagnetic wave which is emitted by the oscillation of\nelectrons of the antenna's surface induced by the tiny electric\nfield of HP. Noteworthy, the target in this novel method is not a\nmass but a surface of the detector because the conversion of HP into\nphoton occurs at the interface of metal-dielectric. The method\nshould work only if the reflectance of mirror is high. But what\nwould be if the reflectance of mirror is low? Here in our work we\nmade a focus exactly on this case, assuming that at higher masses of\nHPs the oscillation of electrons of antennas surface induced by HPs\nwill produce with certain quantum efficiency the emission of single\nelectrons from metal. We take this value equal to the quantum\nefficiency for real photon with energy $\\omega = m_{\\gamma'}$ to\nemit electron from the surface of a metal.

For meticulously cleaned copper the impact of\nelectron shells is clearly seen in the data while for routinely\ncleaned copper the effect of electron shells is rather smoothed.\nThis can explain also a divergence at 10 eV (magenta -- carefully\nprepared clean Cu films while red -- routinely cleaned copper).\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\\label{Conclusion}\n\nA new technique of Multi Cathode Counter (MCC) has been developed to\nsearch for hidden photon CDM by single electrons emitted from the\nsurface of metal.  The sensitivity was estimated in the assumption\nthat all dark matter is composed of hidden photons (HP). In method\nsuggested it was assumed that HPs of the mass greater than a work\nfunction of the metal, the cathode of the counter is fabricated\ninduce emission of single electrons from a cathode. The peculiarity\nof this signature means that conversion of HP in photon occurs at\nthe interface metal-dielectric. The results have been obtained for\nHPs with a mass from 5 to 500 eV from data collected during 60 days\nin November and December, 2015. From the analysis of this data we\nfound no evidence for the existence of HP CDM and set an upper limit\non the photon-HP mixing parameter $\\chi$ with a minimum on the level\nof about $5\\cdot10^{-11}$ at 95\\% CL for the hidden photon mass\n$12\\div15$ eV. Stellar astrophysics provides stringent constraint\nfor this value. Our result is deep inside the regions excluded by\nastrophysical models; see for example \\cite{Haipeng} and references\ntherein. The new thing is that this result with HP CDM was obtained\nin direct measurements with a very peculiar signature of conversion\nHP-photon at the interface metal-dielectric. In our plans are to\ncontinue the measurements to collect more data and to refine the\nprocedure of data treatment. At present time we are also\nconstructing a new detector with a more developed design and with\nthis new detector we are planning to collect data in an underground\nlaboratory with a very low flux of muons.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors appreciate very much the help provided by E.P.Petrov and\nA.I.Egorov in fabrication of the counters and to Grant of Russian\nGovernment \"Leading Scientific Schools of Russia \\#3110.2014.2\" for\npartial support of this work.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{90}\n\n\\bibitem{Okun}  L.B.Okun, Sov.
