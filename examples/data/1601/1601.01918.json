A period of exponential expansion of space solves a number\nof fine-tuning problems of Standard Big Bang cosmology, in particular the horizon\nand flatness problems. Without inflation, finely tuned initial conditions are required\nto explain the observed degree of spatial flatness, and acausal initial condition correlations\nare required in order to explain the observed near isotropy of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB).\n\nIn order for these achievements of cosmological inflation to be counted as real\nsuccesses, inflation should arise without having to impose very special initial\nconditions. At the present time, there are rather conflicting statements on the\nnaturalness of initial conditions for inflation, from articles which claim that there\nis a very serious problem \\cite{Ijjas} to those which claim that inflation arises\nvery naturally \\cite{Nomura, Linde}.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to review the status of the initial condition issue for\ncosmological inflation, and to explain why different authors obtain such diverging\nopinions on the issue. To be specific, I will focus on inflation obtained from matter scalar\nfields minimally coupled to General Relativity as the theory of space-time. \nThe outline of this review is as follows. We first discuss early\nwork which studied the initial condition issue in the context of homogeneous\nand isotropic cosmologies. The real issue, however, is whether inflationary\nexpansion can occur if inhomogeneous initial conditions for both matter fields\nand the metric are allowed. This will be discussed in the third section of the\npaper. We conclude with a discussion section.\n \n\\section{Initial Conditions in Mini-Superspace}\n\nIn this review I will focus on inflation obtained by means of scalar matter\nfields minimally coupled to Einstein gravity. A period of inflation\ncorresponds to a period of accelerated expansion of space. In the\ncontext of Einstein gravity, matter with an equation of state $p < \\frac{1}{3} \\rho$\nis required in order to obtain such expansion. \n\nThe inflationary scenario provides a theory for the origin of\nstructure in the universe which can explain CMB anisotropies and\nthe distribution of galaxies on large scales \\cite{Mukh} (see also\n\\cite{Sato, Press}). Comparison between the predictions of this theory\nand the latest CMB observations \\cite{Planck} tells us that the\nexpansion rate of space was nearly exponential during inflation.\n\nSince exponential expansion corresponds to a de Sitter phase of\nexpansion, the initial conditions question for inflation was first\ndiscussed in the context of de Sitter space. De Sitter space can\nbe obtained by adding a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ to\nthe gravitational action. At a classical level, one can then prove\n``no-hair\" theorems for de Sitter space which show that\nclassical fluctuations about de Sitter space redshift and space-time\napproaches pure de Sitter \\cite{Hawking}. Assuming matter which\nsatisfies the ``strong energy condition\", the no-hair theorem was\nproved in \\cite{Wald} for an isotropic background metric, and by\nStarobinsky \\cite{Starob} (see also \\cite{no-hair-anis}) for\nanisotropic backgrounds.Extensions to the case of matter\nnot satisfying the strong energy condition were recently\nstudied in \\cite{Shahin}. The stability of de Sitter space-time\nto inhomogeneities with vanishing Weyl curvature tensor\n\\cite{Weyl}, to the addition of linear gravitational waves\n\\cite{Starob2} and to linear cosmological fluctuations \\cite{scalar}\nwas also studied. The no-hair conjecture has also been\nproved at nonlinear level for a model containing dust matter\nplus a bare cosmological constant \\cite{Tavakol}. Further extensions and general\nconsiderations were made e.g. in \\cite{ext}. All of these\nanalyses assume that matter obeys the strong energy condition.\nIf this assumption is dropped, then there is the possibility\nof unstable modes \\cite{Barrow}. \n\nQuantum mechanically, the question of stability of de Sitter\nspace-time is open. It is possible that infrared instabilities can\ndestabilize de Sitter (see e.g. \\cite{Polyakov}), although this\nissue is hotly debated (for an opposing point of view see e.g.\n\\cite{Marolf}). Studies of tensor fluctuations \\cite{Woodard}\nalso indicate the de Sitter space-time is unstable, and the\nonset of an instability due to scalar entropic fluctuations can\nalso be shown \\cite{RHB}, although these studies are only\nperturbative and hence cannot truly differentiate between\nan instability of de Sitter and a finite renormalization of the\ncosmological constant due to semi-classical effects.\n\nHowever, the inflationary scenario is not the dynamics\nof space-time in the presence of a bare cosmological\nconstant, but it is the cosmology of a scalar field with\na non-trivial potential energy term in the absence of a\ncosmological constant (any cosmological constant which\nmight explain the current dark energy has negligible effects\nin the very early universe). Hence, the studies of de Sitter\ncosmic no-hair conjectures are not  directly applicable\nto inflationary cosmology.\n\nAs already mentioned, we will focus on scalar field\nrealizations of inflation. For simplicity I will also assume\nthat the scalar field $\\varphi$ has canonical kinetic term.\nThus, the action $S$ is given by\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nS \\, = \\, \\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-g} \\frac{1}{- 16 \\pi G} R \n+ \\frac{1}{2} \\partial_{\\mu} \\varphi \\partial^{\\mu} \\varphi - V(\\varphi) \\, ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S\\,=\\,\\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-g}\\frac{1}{-16\\pi G}R+\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi%&#10;\\partial^{\\mu}\\varphi-V(\\varphi)\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>S</mi></mpadded><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><msup><mi>d</mi><mn>4</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msqrt><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msub><mo>\u2202</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03c6</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mo>\u2202</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03c6</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c6</mi><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01918.tex", "nexttext": "\n\ndoes not admit self-consistent slow roll solutions. Slow-roll\nsolutions can be obtained if the potential near $\\varphi = 0$\nis smoothed out by taking it to be of the Coleman-Weinberg \\cite{CW}\nform. However, it was soon\nrealized \\cite{chaotic, MWU} that in order for\nthe cosmological fluctuations produced during inflation not to be\ntoo large in amplitude, the coupling constant in the potential\n$V(\\varphi)$ as well as those coupling $\\varphi$ to other matter\nfields must be so small that $\\varphi$ will not be in thermal\nequilibrium at early times. Hence, the justification for starting\nthe evolution at $\\varphi \\sim 0$ falls away. \n\nThe initial condition problem for small field models of inflation\nwas studied in detail in \\cite{Piran1} at the level of a classical\nphase space analysis. It was shown that in order to obtain\na sufficiently long period of inflationary expansion, the initial\nscalar field velocity has to be finely tuned (i.e. tuned to be\nmuch smaller than the characteristic value\n$|{\\dot \\varphi}| = H^2$) even if the initial\nvalue of the field itself is set by hand to be very close to zero.\n\nWhereas this fine tuning of the initial scalar field velocity seems\nunnatural for simple potentials, there is one context in which\nit is natural, namely if the initial conditions for the small field\ninflationary phase are set by tunneling from a false vacuum\n\\cite{tunneling}. This scenario cannot be realized with\nrenormalizable scalar field potentials, but it may well arise\nin effective field theories obtained from string theory. What\nis required is a potential for which $\\varphi = 0$ is a metastable\nminimum, and which has a sufficient degree of flatness for\nfield values $|\\varphi|$ beyond the nucleation value to obtain\nenough slow-roll inflation.\n\nAnother context in which the initial scalar field velocity might\nvanish is if the initial conditions for Minkowski space-time\nevolution are set via an analytic continuation from a Euclidean\nquantum gravity region. This is the quantum cosmology\napproach to the initial condition problem of small field\ninflation. The problem is that different ans\\\"atze for the\nwave function of the universe (specifically the Hartle-Hawking \\cite{HH}\nwavefunction or the ``tunneling\" wavefunctions \\cite{LiVi})\ngive very different results for the probability of inflation when applied\nto the same Lagrangian system (see e.g. \\cite{HHH} for\na computation of the probability given the wave function of \\cite{HH}).\n\nThe situation is very different in large field models of inflation. As\nearly work in \\cite{AB1} already hinted at, and as was studied\nin mode detail in \\cite{Kung}, the inflationary slow-roll\ntrajectory is a local attractor (see \\cite{Carroll1} for a more mathematical\ndiscussion of the meaning of the term ``attractor'' in this context)\nin initial condition space, at least at\nthe level of homogeneous and isotropic cosmology\n(see also \\cite{Mukh3}). In large field\ninflation models there is enough time for the excess kinetic energy\ncompared to the energy required during slow-rolling has enough\ntime to redshift, whereas this is not the case for small field inflation.\n\nThe difference in the dynamics between small field and large field\ninflation can be illustrated with phase space diagrams, as\nshown in Figs. 1 - 4. In all four figures, the horizontal axis represents\nthe value of the scalar field. Fig. 1 is a sketch of the potential\nenergy density function (vertical axis)  assumed in small field models,\nFig. 3 is the analog for large field models of inflation.\nFigs. 2 and 4 are sketches of the phase space dynamics for a \nsmall field inflation model (Fig. 2) and a large field model (Fig. 4). The\nvertical axes represent the field momentum. \nThe arrows on the trajectories indicate\nthe evolution in time. It is clear from Figs. 2 and 4 that the slow-roll\ntrajectory labelled with ``SR\" is a local attractor in initial condition\nspace in the case of large field inflation, but not in the case of small\nfield models. The difference in the likelihood of inflation (in the context\nof homogeneous and isotropic cosmology) between large and small\nfield models of inflation has also been more recently confirmed in\n\\cite{Carroll2}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{small_field_potential.pdf}\n\\caption{Sketch of the potential energy function (vertical axis) as a function of the\nscalar field value (horizontal axis) for small field inflation models.

Implicit in the analysis is that all initial conditions which have\na fixed energy density are equally likely, and as initial density we take\na density when the classical dynamical desription becomes justified (e.g.\nthe Planck density). However, in a quantum universe the wave function\nof the universe may not give equal probability to different initial conditions\nwith the same energy density, but may prefer special initial conditions.\nOn these grounds it was argued a long time ago that the initial conditions\nfor inflation (at the mini superspace level) are very likely \\cite{Hawking2}.\nOn the other hand, Penrose \\cite{Penrose} and others \\cite{GT} have\nargued that inflation is extremely unlikely. The different results are due\nto different measures chosen. Specifically, the analysis of \\cite{Penrose, GT}\nuses a measure on phase space configurations today, and asks what set\nof configurations similar to the ones we observe now have come from \ninflationary initial conditions, whereas in the analysis of \\cite{Hawking2}\none is studying measures on the set of initial conditions, a procedure which\nis more appropriate if one has in mind standard Cauchy evolution. In\nfact, it has been shown \\cite{Corichi} (see also \\cite{Corichi2}) that the\nmeasure gets squeezed by time evolution into regions of phase space\nwhich yield inflation. However,\ngeneral difficulties in making arguments based on a measure of initial\nconfigurations were discussed in \\cite{Wald2}.\n\n\\section{Initial Conditions for Inhomogeneous Dynamics}\n\nA discussion of the probability to obtain inflation based on a mini-superspace\nanalysis is only a very limited aspect of the initial conditions problem\nfor inflation. If we assume homogeneity from the outset, then there\nis no horizon problem and inflation is not needed to explain the near\nisotropy of the CMB (it is still needed to explain the spatial flatness\nand to provide causal initial conditions for fluctuations). Thus, we must\nnow consider how likely it is to obtain inflation from general inhomogeneous\ninitial conditions. This issue is not yet completely settled. There are\nauthors who argue that exponential fine tuning of initial conditions\nare required \\cite{Trodden1, Trodden2}, whereas others argue that\neven in the presence of matter and metric fluctuations the slow-roll\ntrajectory of large field inflation is a local attractor in initial condition\nspace \\cite{ABM, Matzner1, Muller, Kung, Feldman}. In the following\nwe will only discuss large field inflation models.\n\nWhy are such different conclusions reached? The analysis of\n\\cite{Trodden1, Trodden2} starts from the assumption that\n``homogeneity\" over a length scale of more than $H^{-1}$, where\n$H$ is the Hubble expansion rate at the beginning of inflation,\nis required in order to obtain inflation. By ``homogeneity\" it is\nhere meant that the energy density has to be dominated by\nthe almost constant mode of the scalar field. It is then argued\nthat it is very unlikely to have such initial conditions. This\nargument, however, clearly will give only a lower bound on\nthe probability of inflation. Since inhomogeneities redshift,\nbut a homogeneous field only slowly rolls and hence decays\nmuch more slowly as a function of time than the fluctuating\nmodes, Hence, homogeneity over a few Hubble patches\nis a sufficient condition to obtain inflation, but clearly it is\nnot a necessary one.\n\nIn fact, it is argued in \\cite{ABM, Muller, Kung, Feldman}\nthat even if the initial energy density was dominated by inhomogeneous\nmodes (inhomogeneity scale smaller than $H^{-1}$) the universe\nis likely to eventually enter a period of inflation provided that there\nis some power in the quasi-homogeneous mode (homogeneous\non scale $H^{-1}$) \\footnote{Note that having power on super-Hubble\nscales is expected. In fact, the absence of such fluctuations would\nrequire acausal initial conditions.} The argument is as follows. Whatever the\ninitial conditions are, the universe will expand. During this\nexpansion phase the energy in the inhomogeneous modes will\nredshift whereas the zero mode of $\\varphi$ will only slowly\nroll. Hence, as long as there is sufficient power in the zero\nmode, it will eventually come to dominate and the universe will\nstart to inflate. Thus, the inflationary slow-roll trajectory is\na local attractor in initial condition space, even in the presence\nof inhomogeneities. This argument, however, misses\npotential back-reaction effects. To second order in the\namplitude of the fluctuating modes, these modes have\nan effect on the background. In particular, it is possible\nthat they will effectively destroy the background and hence\nprevent the onset of inflation.\n\nIt has in fact been shown numerically \\cite{ABM} that in the\nabsence of metric fluctuations the slow-roll trajectory for\nlarge field inflation is a local attractor. The attractor basin is\nin fact very large - the initial density in the inhomogeneous\nfluctuations may be orders of magnitude larger than that in\nthe zero mode. A much improved numerical analysis of\nthis problem has recently been published in \\cite{Easther}.\n\nHowever, it is not consistent to neglect metric fluctuations.\nOne may worry that the presence of initial metric fluctuations\nmay lead space-time to collapse into a gas of black holes rather\nthan lead to an expanding cosmology. On the other hand,\nthe work of \\cite{Feldman} showed that even in the presence\nof metric fluctuations (linearized joint fluctuations of metric\nand matter) the large field slow-roll trajectory remains an\nattractor in initial condition space. \n\nTo go beyond linear theory, methods of numerical relativity\nare required. The initial numerical studies of the onset of\ninflation with inhomogeneous initial conditions were performed\nin \\cite{Piran2, Piran1} in the case of small field inflation models,\nand in \\cite{Matzner1} in the case of large field inflation. Both\nworks used one space-dimensional codes. It was shown that\ninflation was very unlikely in the case of small field inflation,\nbut that it is an attractor in initial condition space for large field\ninflation. \n\nWith the improvements in numerical relativity codes, and\nthe availability of more computational power, it has become\npossible to perform simulations in three spatial dimensions.\nEarly work in three space dimensions is due to \\cite{Matzner2},\nand a more recent study was recently published in \\cite{East}. These\nstudies all come to the conclusion that the slow-roll trajectory\nfor large field inflation is a local attractor given the set of initial\nconditions which were studied. Specifically, in the recent work\nof \\cite{East} it was found that a Hubble patch with initial conditions in\nwhich the inhomogeneities (modelled as a set of Fourier\nmodes with sub-Hubble wavelength) have an energy\ndensity which exceeds that of the background by a\nfactor of $10^3$ will eventually undergo inflation, as\nlong as the average spatial curvature is not postive,\nand as long as the field range remains in the slow-roll\nregime. If the field values entered the non-slow-roll region,\nit was found that sometimes the patch will not inflate.  Thus,\nwhereas the inflationary slow-roll trajectory is a local attractor,\nit is not a global attractor. Another new code is in\ndevelopment \\cite{Lim} and will be used to study the onset\nof inflation.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nAs this review has shown, there has been a lot of work concerning\ninitial conditions for inflation. The author feels that there is now a\nbody of analytical and numerical work supporting the claim that\nin the case of large field models\nthe slow-roll trajectory is a local attractor in initial condition space.\n\nIt is important to distinguish the issue of initial conditions for inflation\nfrom that of the initial conditions for the cosmological fluctuations\nand gravitational waves in an inflationary background. Concerning\nthe latter, one usually argues that the Bunch-Davies \\cite{BD}\nvacuum state is an attractor in the space of states (as far as\nthe evolution of correlation functions is concerned) (see e.g.\n\\cite{Hill} for some early work and \\cite{YiWang} for a recent\nreview). The question of initial conditions for fluctuations is\nrelated to the ``trans-Planckian problem'' for cosmological\nfluctuations which will be touched on below.\n\nSome researchers discount the entire discussion of initial conditions\nfor inflation by saying that as long as there will be one patch which\nstarts to inflate, its physical volume will rapdily come to dominate\nthe Universe.  In particular, if the field is allowed to explore the\nregion in which stochastic forces driving the field up the potential\nbecomes larger in magnitude than the classical force driving\nthe field down the potential \\cite{Starob}, then the physical volume of space\nwill be dominated by inflationary patches. However, what ``dominate'' means \ndepends on the measure one considers, and it is claimed in \\cite{Trodden2}\nthat the probability of inflation remains low even if one takes\nthe exponential growth of inflating regions into account. This debate\nmay be academic, however, since small modifications of the\npotential at super-Planckian field values can easily eliminate the\nregion of stochastic inflation \\cite{Mukh3}. As a bottom line, it is reassuring that\na local dynamical systems analysis seems to show that the initial conditions\nfor inflation do not have to be finely tuned.\n\n Even if the inflationary slow-roll trajectory is a local attractor in\n initial condition space, it is not a global attractor. If the inhomogeneities\n are too large, than we would expect space to collapse into a gas\n of black holes, leading to a picture of the early universe discussed\n in \\cite{Banks} or \\cite{Veneziano}. The author feels, however, that\n the inflationary slow-roll trajectory being a local attractor is already\n a  promising achievement.\n \n Having concluded that the slow-roll trajectory in large field inflation\n is a local attractor in initial condition space, one must keep in mind\n that there are problems in embedding large field inflation into a\n ultra-violet finite quantum theory such as string theory. Axion\n monodromy inflation \\cite{Eva} appears to be the most promising\n route, but there are concerns whether such models are safe\n against back-reaction effects \\cite{Hebeker} and considerations\n based on the ``Weak Gravity Conjecture'', considerations\n which rule out large field inflation in other axion inflation models \n \\cite{Rudelius}. If these problems hold up and one is forced into small field\n inflation, then the initial condition problem for inflation would become\n rather severe.\n \n It is important to keep in mind that the inflationary scenario is at\n best an incomplete picture of the very early universe. Inflation, at\n least in the context of scalar field matter coupled to Einstein gravity,\n is known to be past incomplete \\cite{Borde}. This implies that we\n need to go beyond inflationary cosmology if we really want to \n understand the very earliest moments of the universe. \n \n There are other conceptual problem of inflation (see e.g. \\cite{RHBrev}).\n For one, if inflation last more than $70$ e-folding times, then the\n wavelengths of all scales which are being obsered today are\n smaller than the Planck length at the beginning of the period of\n inflation. As shown in \\cite{Jerome} and many followup papers,\n this gives rise to the ``trans-Planckian'' problem for cosmological\n fluctuations: effects of physics in the ``zone of ignorance'' of\n length scales smaller than the Planck length may well effect the\n nature of the observed fluctuations. Another issue concerns the\n sensitivity of the inflationary mechanism - almost constant potential\n energy density driving accelerated expansion, to our ignorance\n of what renders quantum vacuum energy gravitationally insert.\n \n These and other conceptual issues have led to the development\n of alternative early universe scenarios such as the Pre-Big-Bang\n \\cite{PBB}, the Ekpyrotic scenario \\cite{Ekp}, the ``Matter Bounce''\n \\cite{Fabio} and String Gas Cosmology \\cite{SGC}, to mention only\n a few. Whereas these scenarios do not suffer from the\n trans-Planckian problem for fluctuations, they all have their own\n conceptual problems. In particular, the initial conditions required for several \n of them (e.g. the Pre-Big-Bang and the Matter Bounce scenarios)\nare not attractors in initial condition space \\cite{PP} (on the other hand, the\ntrajectory in the original Ekpyrotic scenario is an attractor \\cite{Gratton}). \n  \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\n\\noindent\n\nThe author is grateful to Yi Wang for producing the figures, and to\nL.
