In this work, we use a hybrid spatial model of tumor response to a DNA-damaging drug to study how the development of chemoresistance in micrometastases depends on the drug dosing schedule. We separately consider cell populations that harbor pre-existing resistance to the drug, and those that acquire resistance during the course of treatment. For each of these independent scenarios, we consider one hypothetical cell line that is responsive to metronomic chemotherapy, and another that cannot be eradicated by a metronomic protocol. Motivated by experimental work on ovarian cancer xenografts, we consider all possible combinations of a one week treatment protocol, repeated for three weeks, and constrained by the total weekly drug dose. Simulations reveal a small number of fractionated-dose protocols that, for the case of acquired resistance, can eradicate micrometastases that are unresponsive to metronomic therapy while also being more efficient at eradicating cell lines that are responsive to metronomic therapy. A subset of those fractionated-dose protocols can also eradicate some pre-existing resistant micrometastases more efficiently than metronomic therapy. Given the responsiveness of very different theoretical cell lines to these few fractionated-dose protocols, these may represent more effective ways to schedule chemotherapy with the goal of limiting metastatic tumor progression. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\noindent 2010 \\textit{Mathematics Subject Classification.} Primary:92C50; Secondary:37N25. \\\\\n\\noindent \\textit{Key words and phrases.}  maximum tolerated dose, metronomic chemotherapy, fractionated therapy, chemoresistance, micrometastases, hybrid model.\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\\subsection{Commonly Used Chemotherapeutic Schedules}\nThe standard cancer chemotherapy treatment protocol is to give a drug at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), with rest periods in between \\cite{Ledzewicz13}. In theory, treating with the MTD is meant to elicit the strongest tumor killing possible without inducing intolerable levels of toxicity. MTD chemotherapy has been successful in the treatment of many hematological cancers, but this approach has failed to demonstrate sustained responses in the majority of solid tumors \\cite{Malik14}. \n\nAs an example in which MTD is routinely used, the treatment of ovarian cancer typically involves surgical debulking followed by cycles of intermittent chemotherapy: systemic exposure to high doses of chemotherapeutics is followed by 3-4 week treatment-free intervals to allow for recovery of healthy tissue \\cite{DeSouza11}. Although this is the standard treatment protocol, clinical trials involving ovarian cancer patients have demonstrated that there is a survival benefit for decreasing the length of the intervals between chemotherapy treatments from 3 weeks to 1 week \\cite{DeSouza11}. Consistent with this finding, preclinical trials have demonstrated that continuous drug exposure results in greater antitumor efficacy than an intermittent schedule in ovarian cancer xenografts due to greater tumor cell kill, reduced proliferation, and reduced angiogenesis \\cite{DeSouza11}. Whether considering the case of continuous infusion, or considering decreasing the time off between chemotherapy doses, drug needs to be administered at a lower dose than the MTD to avoid the accumulation of toxicity. \n\nThe administration of a chemotherapeutic agent at a relatively low, minimally toxic dose, for extended periods of time with no prolonged drug-free break is referred to as metronomic chemotherapy (MC) \\cite{HanahanEtAl:2000}. MC has proven especially effective as an anti-angiogenic treatment, in which the chemotherapeutic agents are directed towards the killing of the endothelial cells, inhibiting their migration, or towards decreasing activity of endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow \\cite{HanahanEtAl:2000,MrossSteinbild:2012,ScharovskyEtAl:2009}. Several clinical trials using this approach are currently active \\cite{MrossSteinbild:2012}. In addition, MC is used as a maintenance treatment to prevent tumor progression after initial application of MTD therapy halts tumor growth \\cite{EmmeneggerEtAl:2011,VivesEtAl:2013}. \n\nIt is also hypothesized that one of the advantages MC has over the MTD approach in solid tumors is that it limits the emergence of drug resistant cancer cells. Drug resistance clinically manifests when a patient initially responds well to chemotherapy, but becomes unresponsive to the protocol after multiple cycles \\cite{Baguley:2010,DeSouza11,KimTannock:2005,ZahreddineBorden:2013}. Unfortunately, such drug resistance is quite common in solid tumors, and drug resistance is the leading cause of chemotherapy failure in the treatment of cancer \\cite{DeSouza11}. Both extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (molecular) factors can induce drug resistance, and drug resistance can be a pre-existing phenomenon, acquired phenomenon, or both. Pre-existing (primary) drug resistance occurs when the tumor contains a subpopulation of drug resistant cells at the initiation of treatment, and these cells are selected for during the course of therapy. Acquired (emerging) resistance involves the adaptation of a tumor cell subpopulation so that the cells gradually develop drug resistance \\cite{Tredan07, Wu13}. \n\n\n\\subsection{Related Mathematical Models}\nMathematical modeling is now widely used to predict anti-cancer drug efficacy, to better understand mechanisms of drug resistance, and to identify novel treatment protocols that limit the emergence of resistance (see \\cite{Brocato14, Foo14, Lavi12} for excellent reviews of modeling work done in these areas). Pioneering work of Coldman and Goldie (e.g., see \\cite{Coldman86}) studies the stochastic switching of cells between sensitive and resistant compartments as a result of point mutations, and uses mathematical predictions to guide treatment schedules. More advanced stochastic models have been developed \\cite{Bozic13,Foo13,Foo09, Foo10, Komarova05, Komarova07, Mumenthaler11}, and these have been used to explore a range of questions. For example, Komarova and Wodarz developed a model for multi-drug resistance using a multi-type birth-death process. In these models, resistance to each targeted small-molecule drug was conferred by a single random genetic mutation, and they explore how the number of drugs needed to prevent treatment failure depends on the initial size of the tumor at the start of treatment, as well as the role of cell quiescence \\cite{Komarova05, Komarova07}. As another example, Foo and Michor used a nonhomogeneous multi-type birth-death process model to investigate optimal dosing of a targeted anti-cancer drug to minimize the risk of resistance (assuming resistance is due to a single (epi)genetic alteration) constrained by drug toxicity \\cite{Foo09, Foo10}. This work was later extended to consider combination therapy with a small molecule inhibitor and a chemotherapeutic agent \\cite{Mumenthaler11}. \n\nNon-spatial continuum-based approaches have also been widely used to model drug resistance and to try and control its emergence. Optimal control problems have been formulated to analyze nonlinear ordinary differential equation models involving resistant and sensitive cancer cells (see, e.g., \\cite{Hadjiandreou13, LedzewiczEtAl:2015,Ledzewicz06}). As an example, Ledzewicz and Sch\\\"{a}ttler studied how bang-bang controls (full doses with rest periods in beween) and singular controls (time-varying partial doses) could be used to find chemotherapy schedules that control and prolong the onset of drug resistance \\cite{Ledzewicz06}. This work was recently extended to include metronomic therapy \\cite{LedzewiczEtAl:2015}. Also using a non-spatial continuum approach, Gatenby and colleagues explore tumor dynamics and control in response to an evolutionary ``double-bind\" therapy in which cellular adaptations to one treatment renders the cancer increasingly vulnerable to a second therapeutic attack \\cite{Cunningham11, Orlando12}. Unlike in \\cite{Ledzewicz06} and \\cite{Hadjiandreou13}, a continuous spectrum of phenotypic resistance is considered in these models. A continuous spectrum of phenotypic resistance has also been considered by Lorz et al. using an integro-differential equation framework to describe mutations between sensitive (but more fit) and resistant (less fit) cancer cells \\cite{Lorz13}. Levy and colleagues built upon this work to include the effects of density dependence on cancer cell division and death rates, as well as to account for both genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to resistance \\cite{Greene14,Lavi13}. \n\nWhile interesting insights have been drawn from stochastic branching models and deterministic continuum models, both approaches neglect to consider the important role played by spatial (microenvironmental) heterogeneity in the formation of drug resistance. Spatial impacts on the dynamics of pre-existing drug resistance were first considered by Jackson and Byrne using partial differential equations to study spherically symmetric growth and response to treatment (under bolus versus continuous injection) of a heterogeneous tumor composed of two cell types: low proliferation but high drug resistance or high proliferation but more drug sensitive \\cite{Jackson00}. Nowak and colleagues considered treatment with a targeted therapy in a non-symmetric three-dimensional spatial model of heterogeneous tumor progression at metastatic sites. Assuming drug is uniformly distributed in the tumor, they quantified how the temporal probability of regrowth varies depending on the net growth rate of the tumor and the dispersal probabilities \\cite{Waclaw15}. Finally, the work of Lorz et al. \\cite{Lorz13} was also extended to include diffusion of drug and nutrient in a spherically symmetric environment. By including a spatial component, they could study how tumor cell heterogeneity and resistance adapt to the surrounding environment \\cite{Lorz15}. In each of these spatial works, a uniform or spherically symmetric microenvironment is assumed, which over-simplifies much of the microenvironmental heterogeneity that influences the emergence of drug resistance.\n\nThere have only been a handful of attempts to consider the emergence of drug resistance in heterogeneous microenvironments. Silva and Gatenby \\cite{Silva10} introduced a two-dimensional cellular automaton model composed of chemosensitive cells that are rapidly dividing and chemoresistant cells that are slow dividing. Accounting for spatial distributions of oxygen, glucose and pH buffers, they found that optimal tumor control in the case of pre-existing resistance is achieved when a glucose competitor drug was followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy in two separate doses \\cite{Silva10}. Menchon developed a two-population (resistant and sensitive), two-dimensional cellular automaton model and used it to study how pre-existing resistance and acquired resistance that is not drug-induced influences treatment with an otherwise successful chemotherapeutic drug \\cite{Menchon15}. Powathil et al. developed a two-dimensional hybrid multiscale cellular automaton model to study the effects of cell-cycle based chemotherapeutic drugs on cancer cell populations with drug resistance in heterogeneous microenvironments \\cite{Powathil}.\n\nIn contrast to the previous mathematical models that consider anti-mitotic drugs and assume that chemoresistant cells are proliferating less frequently, we developed a hybrid spatial off-lattice model to explore the resistance dynamics induced by exposure to a DNA damaging drug \\cite{Gevertz15}. Unlike previous models, in this work the impact of the heterogeneous microenvironment in the case of both pre-existing and drug-induced acquired resistance is quantified. We found that microenvironmental pressures modeled through a heterogeneous spatial configuration of blood vessels does not significantly impact transient and long-term tumor behavior when resistance is pre-existing, but does have a significant impact when resistance is acquired. In fact, in the case of acquired resistance, we showed that microenvironmental niches of low drug/suficient oxygen and low drug/low oxygen play an important role in the development of resistance \\cite{Gevertz15}. The conclusion that acquired resistance is likely to arise first in the ``poor drug penetration sanctuaries\" was recently independently established in \\cite{Fu15} using a multi-compartment model of an anti-mitotic drug in which chemoresistant cells have a growth disadvantage. Unlike in our study \\cite{Gevertz15}, the work in \\cite{Fu15} assumes spatial heterogeneity between different metastatic sites, but not within a metastatic site. That said, it is the fact that both models account for spatial heterogeneity (explicitly or implicitly) that allow for such a prediction to be made.\n\n\\subsection{Summary of Current Work}\nFocusing on the influence of systemic chemotherapy at metastatic sites, we point out that relatively less attention has been spent investigating this question as compared to studying drug impact at the site of the primary tumor. Experimentally, it is difficult to recreate the whole metastatic cascade starting with cancer cell invasion from the primary tumor, to vascular transport, to colonization of distant sites \\cite{SaxenaChristofori:2013}. The early stages of metastatic development (micrometastasis) are also difficult to monitor since small masses of tumor cells are clinically undetectable. Moreover, the use of mice models is limited in time as the animals must be euthanized once their primary tumors reach a certain size. There is also a limited mathematical literature devoted to metastatic response to systemic chemotherapy \\cite{BenzekryHahnfeldt:2013,CunninghamEtAl:2015,Fu15}. In the present work, we build off our previously developed self-calibrated spatial hybrid model  \\cite{Gevertz15} to explore the effects of DNA-damaging drug dosing schedule (MTD, metronomic, fractionated) on the development of chemoresistance in simulated tumor micrometastases. We show that in the case of strong acquired resistance, micrometastases which become resistant to a metronomic chemotherapy can actually be eradicated by protocols in which drug doses are broken into several daily injections (3-5 days a week), known as fractionated-dose (FD) therapy \\cite{Buffoni06}. A handful of these FD protocols were also more efficient than metronomic therapy at eliminating weak resistant micrometastases, defined as those for which metronomic therapy is an effective treatment protocol. Several of these top protocols are also successful treatment strategies in the case of pre-existing resistance when the level of intrinsic drug resistance is not too strong (cell populations can be eradicated by metronomic therapy). On the other hand, if the pre-existing resistance to the drug is so strong that tumor does  not respond to metronomic therapy, it is more challenging to design a treatment protocol to overcome the resistance. In this case, we propose protocols that can delay the progression from micrometastases to the formation of secondary tumors.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{flowchart_algorithm.png}\\\\\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize{Flowchart of cell behavior in response to microenvironmental factors of oxygen and drug.

Within the tissue slice, the position of four non-evolving blood vessels is imposed, and these act as the source of both oxygen  and drug. Gradients of oxygen and drug in tissue space, determined by numerically solving the associated partial differential equations (PDEs), impact the behavior of the discrete cancer cells in the model. Cells will either remain viable and proliferate or become hypoxic and quiescent based on both oxygen levels (cell-microenvironment interactions) and the crowdedness of the local microenvironment (cell-cell interactions via a particle-spring framework). Additionally, cells are damaged based on how much of the DNA damaging drug they uptake at each discrete time point, and cancer cells can die if their damage level exceeds the maximum amount of damage tolerable by that cell. The clonal predecessor of each surviving cell is also tracked in order to determine which clones, if any, survive treatment with the DNA damaging drug \\cite{Gevertz15}. The entire algorithm indicating cellular response to microenvironmental factors in the model is illustrated in Figure \\ref{figure:flowchart}. The details of the model are presented in \\cite{Gevertz15}, and here we only summarize the discrete and continuous components of the model, as well as the impact of drug action. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Discrete Model Components}\n\nThe discrete portion of the model describes cells using an off-lattice, agent-based approach. Each cell is defined by the following: (1) Cell position (determined by cell nucleus, all cells have a fixed radius); (2) Cell age; (3) Cell maturation age (age at which cell is ready to divide); (4) Level of oxygen sensed from local microenvironment, as defined in the PDE for oxygen (determines if cell has become   hypoxic); (5) Intracellular drug level, as defined in the PDE for drug  (determined by uptake from local microenvironment); (6) Level of accumulated DNA damage; (7) Level of DNA damage the cell can tolerate (death threshold); (8) Clonal predecessors.\n\nThe equations of cell mechanics are based on the previously published model by Meineke et al. \\cite{Meineke01}, in which cells of a fixed radius (defined by the location of their nucleus) exert Hookean repulsive forces on any cells they come into contact with. A cell responds to the repulsive forces acting upon it through Newtownian equations of motion, where the connecting springs are overdamped so that the system returns to equilibrium without oscillations. More details can be found in \\cite{Gevertz15}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Continuous Model Components}\n\nThe change in both oxygen $\\xi$ and drug $\\gamma$ at location $\\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$ in the tissue space depends on supply from the vasculature nearby $V_j$ (where $\\chi$ is a characteristic function defining the vessel neighborhood), diffusion, and cellular uptake by nearby tumor cells $C_k$. Drug, but not oxygen, also decays in the tissue space.

Sink-like boundary conditions are imposed along all domain boundaries, in which the change in concentration with respect to the outward facing normal is proportional to the concentration along the boundary. The PDEs are numerically solved using a forward-difference approximation in time on a square grid (centered difference in space). The PDE parameters, arrived at through a self-calibration process, are provided in \\cite{Gevertz15}. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Modeling Cell Response to DNA Damaging Drug} \n\nEach cell has a unique, molecularly-wired sensitivity to drug-induced DNA damage. The cell-level variable that controls this sensitivity in the model is $C_k^{death}$, the maximum amount of drug-induced damage the $k^{th}$ cell can tolerate; we will refer to this as the death threshold of the cell. The duration and level of drug exposure within a cell will determine the increase of DNA damage within the cell ($C_k^{dam}$), while the rate of DNA damage repair ($p$) will regulate the natural decrease of DNA damage. A cell with absolutely no tolerance to the drug ($C_k^{death} = 0$) would die as soon as the slightest bit of drug-induced DNA damage occurs, which is not biologically realistic. Therefore, we assume that in the baseline case of a homogeneous population of chemosensitive cells (i.e., no pre-existing resistance), each cell has a fixed death threshold of $C_k^{death} = Thr_{death} = 0.5$, where the value of $Thr_{death}$ has previously been determined through the parameter self-calibration process \\cite{Gevertz15}. \n\nIn the absence of any drug resistance in an initially homogeneous population of cells, the only variation between cells is in how much damage they have accumulated, and this is a function of both space and time. The drug-induced DNA damage is assumed to depend on the current change in intracellular drug concentration ($\\Delta \\gamma =$ drug uptake minus decay) and on the rate of DNA repair. As in \\cite{Gevertz15}, we assume that DNA repair is proportional to the current amount of DNA damage. However, unlike in \\cite{Gevertz15}, we do not assume that damage increases at a rate proportional to $\\Delta \\gamma$, as frontloading the tumor with very high doses of drug would cause such high damage levels that the tumor can be killed with one very large chemotherapy dose. Although this could be true clinically such a dose would not be attainable due to toxicity, and this feature of the model would interfere with finding optimal treatment protocols. Therefore in this model we define\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 20867, "prevtext": "\n\n\\end{small}\n\n\\begin{small}\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text":

Sink-like boundary conditions are imposed along all domain boundaries, in which the change in concentration with respect to the outward facing normal is proportional to the concentration along the boundary. The PDEs are numerically solved using a forward-difference approximation in time on a square grid (centered difference in space). The PDE parameters, arrived at through a self-calibration process, are provided in \\cite{Gevertz15}. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Modeling Cell Response to DNA Damaging Drug} \n\nEach cell has a unique, molecularly-wired sensitivity to drug-induced DNA damage. The cell-level variable that controls this sensitivity in the model is $C_k^{death}$, the maximum amount of drug-induced damage the $k^{th}$ cell can tolerate; we will refer to this as the death threshold of the cell. The duration and level of drug exposure within a cell will determine the increase of DNA damage within the cell ($C_k^{dam}$), while the rate of DNA damage repair ($p$) will regulate the natural decrease of DNA damage. A cell with absolutely no tolerance to the drug ($C_k^{death} = 0$) would die as soon as the slightest bit of drug-induced DNA damage occurs, which is not biologically realistic. Therefore, we assume that in the baseline case of a homogeneous population of chemosensitive cells (i.e., no pre-existing resistance), each cell has a fixed death threshold of $C_k^{death} = Thr_{death} = 0.5$, where the value of $Thr_{death}$ has previously been determined through the parameter self-calibration process \\cite{Gevertz15}. \n\nIn the absence of any drug resistance in an initially homogeneous population of cells, the only variation between cells is in how much damage they have accumulated, and this is a function of both space and time. The drug-induced DNA damage is assumed to depend on the current change in intracellular drug concentration ($\\Delta \\gamma =$ drug uptake minus decay) and on the rate of DNA repair. As in \\cite{Gevertz15}, we assume that DNA repair is proportional to the current amount of DNA damage. However, unlike in \\cite{Gevertz15}, we do not assume that damage increases at a rate proportional to $\\Delta \\gamma$, as frontloading the tumor with very high doses of drug would cause such high damage levels that the tumor can be killed with one very large chemotherapy dose. Although this could be true clinically such a dose would not be attainable due to toxicity, and this feature of the model would interfere with finding optimal treatment protocols.

The lack of  spatial variability in terms of how cells acquire resistance to the drugs is further illustrated when observing the small standard deviation in the death threshold for this value of $\\gamma_{exp}$. In order to allow for more variability in the acquired case, in this work we use a concentration threshold twenty times larger ($\\gamma_{exp}=0.2$), so that cells with more access to the drug develop resistance quicker than cells with less drug access.

In each simulation we will start from a small cluster of cancer cells embedded in the tissue slice (as shown in top of the left column in Fig. \\ref{figure:flowchart}). We will separately consider two kinds of anti-cancer resistance: either acquired or pre-existing, and for each of them will examine two hypothetical cancer cell lines that differ in their pharmacological response to the drug under consideration. In order to evaluate the different drug administration schedules, we will compare average tumor response over ten trials per treatment protocol. Our baseline treatment will be a metronomic, continuous infusion of drug (model parameter $drugIn = 1$ in each iteration, with one day corresponding to 960 iterations). Following the experimental data on ovarian cancer xenografts \\cite{DeSouza11}, we will consider weekly treatment protocols in which on each day of the week, drug is either administered continuously or not given (fractionated-dose (FD) therapy). However, to constrain the overall drug toxicity over a period of a week, we will control the amount of drug administered during that time. That is, at the end of the week, no matter how many days the treatment was given, each mouse in \\cite{DeSouza11} received the same amount of drug, and therefore by the end of each week in our simulations, the total amount of drug administered is fixed. As in \\cite{DeSouza11}, the one-week treatment protocol will be administered three times, for a total of three weeks of treatment. Using our model, we will test all $2^7 - 1= 127$ possible treatment protocols of either giving (indicated with a 1) or not giving (indicated with a 0) drug on each of the seven days of the week, leaving out the case of no drug every day of the week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Acquired Resistance}\n\nUsing the previously-described model with the probability of DNA damage repair fixed at $p = 1.5\\times 10^{-4}$, as in \\cite{Gevertz15}, we identified the following acquired resistance parameter regimes when the micrometastatic tumo is treated using MC ($drugIn = 1$):\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item Tumor eradication (weak resistance): $0 \\leq \\Delta_{death} \\leq 4\\times10^{-5}$\n \\item Drug resistant tumor (strong resistance): $4.5\\times10^{-5} \\leq \\Delta_{death} \\leq 10^{-4}$\n \\item Complete treatment failure: $\\Delta_{death} \\geq 1.5\\times10^{-4}$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe case of complete treatment failure is defined as the tumor showing no measurable response to the metronomic protocol (see \\cite{Gevertz15}). This parameter regime will not be considered here, as drugs without any measurable anti-tumor response in the model likely have parameter values outside the scope of clinically-approved drugs. For further consideration, we will chose two cell lines, one that was eradicated by the metronomic therapy and one that became resistant ($\\Delta_{death}$=$3.5\\times 10^{-5}$ and $\\Delta_{death}$=$5.9\\times 10^{-5}$, respectively).\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Optimization for Weakly Resistant Micrometastases}\n\nWe performed a detailed analysis of drug administration protocols on a cell line for which the rate that DNA damage increases due to prolonged drug exposure is given by $\\Delta_{death} = 3.5\\times 10^{-5}$. Here, we sought to find treatment protocols that could eradicate the tumor quicker than metronomic therapy (Fig. 3(c)-(d)). We found that 21 of the treatment schedules tested out-performed the MC protocol (with a number of the top protocols shown in Table \\ref{table:acquired_ranking}), and each of these treatment protocols was successful at eliminating the tumor in each of the 10 trials run (10 different seeds for a random number generator).\n\n\n\n\\begin{tiny}\n\\begin{table}[ht!]\n\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{1.05in}|c|>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{1.05in}|>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{0.95in}|}\n\\hline\n & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{\\textbf{Tumor Eradication}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{\\textbf{Drug Resistant}} \\\\ \n & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{\\textbf{Parameter Regime}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{\\bf Parameter Regime} \\\\ \n & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{ (100\\% eradication)} & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{} \\\\ \n\n\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Treatment} & \\textbf{Ranking} & \\textbf{Average Time $\\pm$ STD} (In days) & \\textbf{Ranking} & \\textbf{Average Time $\\pm$ STD} (In days) & \\textbf{Percent Eradicated} \\\\ \\hline \n\n{[1100000]} & 1 & 3.21 $\\pm$ 0.41  & 4 & 10.35  $\\pm$ 8.29 &  70\\\\\n\n{[1111000]} & \t2 & 4.21 $\\pm$ 0.79    & 1 & 7.01   $\\pm$ 1.97 & 100\\\\\n\n{[1110000]} & \t3 & 4.32 $\\pm$ 1.24 & \t2 & 8.95  $\\pm$ 5.75 &  90\\\\\n\n{[1100100]} & 4 & 4.71  $\\pm$ 3.10 &10 & 19.54 $\\pm$ 3.03 & \t  30\\\\\n\n{[1110100]} & \t5 & 4.85  $\\pm$ 1.06 & \t3 & 9.62  $\\pm$ 2.62 & 100\\\\\n\n{[1101000]} & 6 & 5.15  $\\pm$ 2.96 & \t7 & 16.98 $\\pm$ 4.67 &  50\\\\\n\n{[1111100]} & \t7 & 5.64 $\\pm$ 0.93    &11 & 19.67 $\\pm$ 4.20 &  10\\\\\n\n{[1111001]} & \t8 & 5.78 $\\pm$ 1.10  & \t8 & 17.51 $\\pm$ 5.77 &   30\\\\\n\n{[1111010]} & \t9 & 5.84 $\\pm$ 0.82    & \t9 & 18.76 $\\pm$ 4.76&   20\\\\\n\n{[1110001]} &10 & 6.18 $\\pm$ 2.23 & \t6 & 14.75 $\\pm$ 4.58 &   70\\\\ \n$\\cdots$     &     &                                        &     &                                          &\\\\\n\n{[1110010]} &15 & 6.77 $\\pm$ 2.89 &\t5   & 12.92 $\\pm$ 3.73 & 90\\\\\n\n{[1111111]} & \t22 & 8.80 $\\pm$ 1.40 &\t \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{Fails to eradicate tumor in any of 10 trials}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize{Top treatment protocols for a weakly acquired or strongly acquired resistant cell line, where 1 indicates drug is administered and 0 indicates no drug is administered on a given day.

However, if the drug dose is too high at the beginning of the week and the off-time is too long (such as in protocol [1000000], an example of the MTD protocol), the treatment generally fails, as it only leads to tumor eradication in 1 in 10 trials. In other words, a FD protocols in which moderate doses of drug are given at the beginning of the week appear to be the optimal way to target a tumor with only acquired resistance, at least in the weak resistance regime. The result of treating a tumor with any one of these top three protocols follows the trend shown in Figure \\ref{figure:acquired_eradication3}(e)-(f). We find the dynamics in this case are very similar to the case of metronomic therapy (Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_eradication3}(c)-(d)): the average damage level rapidly catches up to the average death threshold, resulting in tumor eradication. The optimal strategy is superior to metronomic therapy in that the magnitude of the rebound in tumor size (once the therapy starts to cause tumor shrinkage) is smaller (Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_eradication3}(e) vs. Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_eradication3}(c)), and therefore the tumor is eradicated faster.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht!]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{plots_aquired_eradication_param_regime_timeDays.png}\\\\\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize{Efficacy of various treatment protocols in the case of acquired resistance in the tumor-eradication (weak resistance) parameter regime.

(a)-(b) represents a MTD protocol that is one of the worst-case scenarios; (c)-(d) represents MC, this ranked 22 of 127 tested protocols; (e)-(f) represents the optimal treatment protocol, a FD protocol that eradicates tumors the fastest.}}\n  \\label{figure:acquired_eradication3}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSimulations also revealed that 64 of 127 treatment protocols were able to eradicate the tumor 100\\% of the time, meaning there are many different treatment protocols that would lead to tumor eradication in this parameter regime. Therefore, it is also interesting to explore the strategies that cannot eradicate the tumor, and try to understand what goes wrong in those cases. These strategies have at least two of the following common features: 1) Relatively high doses of the drug administered each day it is given; 2) Limited amount of drug given on the first 4 days of treatment (0-1 doses), allowing the tumor ample time to grow before significant amounts of drug is given; 3) Large spacing between drug doses. The MTD schedule of [1000000] discussed above is explored further in Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_eradication3}(a)-(b). In this case, the tumor oscillates wildly in size due to the high drug dose given and the long rest period. Since the average death threshold of the cancer cells increases, while the average damage level is actually decreasing, continued administration of this weekly dosage schedule is not expected to ever result in tumor eradication. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Optimization for Strongly Resistant Micrometastases}\n\nIn this parameter regime, we consider a cell line for which the rate of DNA damage increase due to prolonged drug exposure is given by $\\Delta_{death} = 5.9\\times10^{-5}$. Although the MC protocol fails to eradicate these tumors, here we will still search for treatment schedules that eliminate the tumor the quickest. \n\nNote that only two treatment strategies ([1111000], [1110100]) were able to eradicate the tumor each of the 10 times the treatment protocol was tested (Table \\ref{table:acquired_ranking}). These cases were also ranked in the top five of protocols most efficient at eradicating weakly resistant tumors. This suggests that the top strategies for acquired resistance do not greatly depend on whether the resistance is weak or strong. \n\nThat said, as one would expect, it is much harder to find treatment protocols to eradicate the tumor in the strong resistance parameter regime. Only 14 of the 127 treatment protocols tested were successful at tumor eradication in this parameter regime for at least 1 of the 10 trials. The majority of those treatment protocols are shown in Table \\ref{table:acquired_ranking}. Note that each protocol that has some success in the strong resistance parameter regime was also a successful treatment (eradicated 100\\% of tumors) in the weak resistance parameter regime (Table \\ref{table:acquired_ranking}). This lends further support to the idea that the superior approaches in the case of acquired resistance are not sensitive to the parameter regime under consideration (the value of $\\Delta_{death}$). \n\nTo provide more details, the simulations reveal that if drug levels are too high in the beginning (such as in a MTD protocol [1000000]), an acquired strongly resistant tumor cannot be eradicated. The very high dose drives resistance too quickly (Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_drug_resist3}(b)), and tumor cannot recover from this during the break (Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_drug_resist3}(a)). On the other hand, without any break in treatment (such as in the MC protocol [1111111]), the lack of an ``off\" time coupled with the low daily drug dose results in significant resistance without sufficient damage (Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_drug_resist3}(c)-(d)). This is the case in which the weakly resistant parameter regime differs most noticeably from the strongly resistant parameter regime. However, in both cases, it is the intermediate FD protocols ([1111000], [1110000]) for which drug doses are sufficiently high to cause enough damage to the tumor while limiting the evolution of resistance (Fig. \\ref{figure:acquired_drug_resist3}(e)-(f)). \n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{plots_aquired_drug_resistant_param_regime_timeDays.png}\\\\\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize{Efficacy of various treatment protocols in the case of acquired resistance in the drug resistant (strong resistance) parameter regime.

In this section, we sought to find alternative treatment protocols that could eradicate the tumor quicker than MC. We found that 10 of the treatment protocols tested out-performed MC (Table \\ref{table:pre_eradication_ranking}), though only 4 of those were successful at eradicating the tumor for each of the 10 trials. Each of the protocols that outperformed MC had 1-3 off days scattered throughout the week, though beyond this no obvious pattern in those protocols can be identified. The result of treating a tumor with any one of these top protocols follows the trend shown in Figure \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(e)-(f). The resistant cell population is always selected for, as evidenced by the average value of the death threshold plateauing at 0.5$\\times$3.25 = 1.625 (the value of the death threshold in the resistant cell population), with the standard deviation decreasing to zero as the plot plateaus (meaning all cells have this higher death threshold and the sensitive cells have been eliminated from the population). In spite of the fact that the resistant cells are selected for, the damage induced by the drug is not repaired quick enough, and eventually the resistant cells are killed by the drug. Importantly, the dynamics in the optimal case are qualitatively identical to the dynamics in the MC case. MC administration just slightly delays the second local maximum in the plot of tumor size versus time, and therefore it takes longer to eradicate the tumor. The difference in treatment response between the optimal therapy and MC are not very significant in the case of pre-existing resistance.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{plots_preex_eradication_param_regime_more_time_timeDays.png}\\\\\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize{Efficacy of various treatment protocols in the case of pre-existing resistance in the tumor eradication (weak resistance) parameter regime.

In other words, there are many treatment protocols that can lead to tumor eradication. Since so few treatment protocols fail, it is interesting to explore what make a schedule unsuccessful. Figure \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(c)-(d) looks at one representative case ([1000010]) in which the treatment protocol fails to eradicate the tumor after repeating the one-week protocol three times, even though tumor size is on the decline at the end of three weeks of treatment (Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(c) at 21 days). In this case, the resistant cell population has not out-competed the sensitive cell population, as evidenced by the average death threshold well below the value for resistant cells (1.625) (Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(d)). Though it would seem that the survival of sensitive cells should facilitate tumor response to treatment, an interesting phenomenon emerges here: the behavior of the damage and death threshold curves actually appear to have synchronized. Therefore, if treatment were extended, any of the following three options are plausible: 1) Synchronization breaks and tumor is eradicated; 2) Synchronization breaks and treatment fails; 3) Synchronization holds and tumor oscillates in size throughout the duration of therapy. Follow-up simulations in which the treatment protocol is repeated over 6 weeks reveal that for this treatment, synchronization eventually breaks and the tumor can be eradicated, though it requires being treated with double the amount of drug (Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(c)).   \n\n\nFigure \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(a)-(b) looks at a second representative case ([1000000]) in which the MTD treatment protocol fails to eradicate the tumor after repeating the one-week protocol three times. In this case, the death threshold and damage dynamics appear very similar to the case where the tumor can be eradicated (compare Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(b) at early times to Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(f)). However, the damage level in the case of [1000000] has failed to catch up with the death threshold of the resistant cell population (which has out-competed the sensitive cells), so the tumor was not eradicated after three weeks of treatment. Applying the treatment protocol for three additional weeks does not lead to tumor eradication, unlike in the case of [1000010]. Instead, damage levels continue to oscillate at values below the constant death threshold, and the MTD treatment seemingly will fail even if repeated beyond six weeks (Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_erad3}(a)-(b)). \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Optimization for Strongly Resistant Micrometastases}\n\nThis strongly resistant parameter regime ($Thr_{mult} = 3.25$, $p = 1.5\\times 10^{-4}$) was classified as one in which MC cannot eradicate the tumor, as DNA is repaired  much quicker than in weakly resistant cells. In this parameter regime, we already know that MC cannot eradicate the tumor, and in fact, we also found no other treatment protocol could result in tumor eradication. For this reason, we searched for treatments that prolong the emergence of a resistant tumor. The metric we chose to maximize is the time to ``point of no return\" ($\\tau$), which we define as  a period between the first time at which tumor starts to decrease in size and the time at which tumor growth starts to monotonically increase without any further shrinking (Table \\ref{table:pre_drug_resist_ranking} and Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_resist3}). Interestingly, the top six treatments for maximizing $\\tau$ are also the top six treatments for minimizing the average death threshold of the tumor after three weeks of treatment (though the precise ranking varies). This strongly suggests that the way to maximize the ``point of no return\" time is to select for tumors that are clonally diverse (meaning more sensitive cells survive the treatment). \n\n\n\n\\begin{tiny}\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{1.3in}|>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{1in}|>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{0.95in}|>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{0.9in}|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Treatment} & \\textbf{Ranking (Time to $\\tau$, ``point of no return\")} & \\textbf{Average $\\tau$ $\\pm$ STD}  (In days) & \\textbf{Ranking (Average death threshold)} & \\textbf{Average Death Threshold $\\pm$ STD}  \\\\ \\hline \n\n{[0000100]} &\t1 &\t8.17 $\\pm$ 4.22   & \t4 & \t1.38 $\\pm$ 0.07 \\\\\n\n{[0000001]} &\t2 &\t7.60 $\\pm$ 2.05  &   \t1 & \t1.21 $\\pm$ 0.19 \\\\\n\n{[0001000]} &\t3 &\t7.43 $\\pm$ 2.09   &  \t2 & \t1.35 $\\pm$ 0.07 \\\\\n\n{[0000010]} &\t4 &\t7.35 $\\pm$ 2.17  &  \t6 & \t1.45 $\\pm$ 0.05 \\\\\n\n{[0010000]} &\t5 &\t6.02 $\\pm$ 2.00    & \t3 & \t1.36 $\\pm$ 0.08 \\\\\n\n{[0001001]} &\t6 &\t5.52 $\\pm$ 4.78    &\t5 & \t1.39 $\\pm$ 0.10 \\\\\n\n{[1111111]} &\t71 &\t 1.71 $\\pm$ 0.96 &\t110\t & 1.62 $\\pm$ 0.00  \\\\\n{[0000000]} &\tN/A  &\tN/A  &\tN/A  & 0.54 $\\pm$ 0.02  \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize{Pre-existing strong resistance regime: Therapies that prolong time to the ``point of no return\", $\\tau$, by at least 25\\% of the treatment window, along with the results for MC and no treatment.

In parts (a)-(b) of the figure, we see that when no drug is administered, a clonally diverse tumor population survives the treatment protocol. The drug resistant clones (which are illustrated through red circles and red x's) are not selected for since they have no survival advantage in the absence of drug.  Therefore, the average death threshold of the tumor without treatment is very low (very close to the death threshold of the sensitive cell population with a very small standard deviation). The implications of this are quite interesting: it says that if drug resistant cells have no other fitness advantage, there is a potential for sensitive cells to outcompete the drug resistant cells before treatment begins. In this case, delaying treatment would actually give a much greater chance of treatment success than starting treatment earlier, when drug resistant cells compose a larger percent of the tumor. In Figure \\ref{figure:pre_drug_resist3}(c)-(d), we see how the MTD treatment [0000001] also preserves clonal diversity within the tumor at the end of the treatment window. While not as diverse as in the case with no treatment, delaying the onset of treatment until the last day of the week, coupled with giving a very high dose at the end of that week, appears to be one of the best ways to limit the emergence of the resistant cell population while still administering drug. In the particular case illustrated here, the resistant clones are still being selected for, but they have not come to dominate tissue space at the end of the treatment window. Comparing this to MC (Figure \\ref{figure:pre_drug_resist3}(e)-(f)), we see [0000001] gives a short time to ``point of no return\", while also selecting for the drug resistant clones (Fig. \\ref{figure:pre_drug_resist3}(f)). \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.92\\textwidth]{plots_preex_drug_resistant_param_regime_timeDays_labeled.png}\\\\\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize{Efficacy of various treatment protocols in the case of strong pre-existing resistance.

There was only one protocol ([1111000]) that led to 100\\% eradication of tumors derived from three of the cell lines; this protocol only failed on the cell line with the pre-existing strong resistance. This FD protocol represents a potentially powerful dosing schedule for targeting micrometastases from cells with differing resistance types and capacities.\n\nWhile at first pass this appears to be the only protocol capable of successful eradication for tumors derived from three different cell lines, the story is more nuanced than this. Since irregular vasculature results in the existence of tissue hypoxic niches in which tumor cells became quiescent and non-proliferative, in some protocols several hypoxic quiescent cells can remain. These protocols are not ranked as capable of tumor eradication, but do not result in a resistant tumor that can repopulate the whole tissue. This raises the question of how we should define an effective treatment protocol. To address this, the following three measurements were calculated to quantitatively compare different protocols: (i) the average (over ten treatment repeats) number of cells that have not been eradicated by the three-week protocol, (ii) the standard deviation in the remaining cell number, and (iii) the percentage of treatments that led to tumor eradication.\n\nUsing these metrics, we performed a k-means clustering to partition all data into clusters grouped around the nearest mean (a cluster center) that serves as a prototype of the cluster. The algorithm generated ten clusters that are color-coded and shown in the left panel of  Fig. \\ref{figure:VennDiagram}. These clusters have been classified as effective or ineffective treatment protocols based on the following logic. If the percentage of eradicated tumors is large, and remaining tumors are small (on average) with small to moderate standard deviation in tumor sizes, they are clearly effective, since the remaining cells are most likely located in the hypoxic niches (green and red clusters in Fig. \\ref{figure:VennDiagram}). If the remaining tumors are of moderate sizes (much smaller than the mean size value calculated from original data), and the standard deviation in tumor size is relatively big--this means that there is significant variability in the remaining tumor sizes, majority of which are not large. Thus, we consider these protocols to be successful (a blue cluster in Fig. \\ref{figure:VennDiagram}) independent of whether the percentage of eradicated tumors is small, moderate or large. Again, the remaining tumors are composed of a small number of cells that are non-proliferative and hypoxic (more details can be found in our previous work \\cite{Gevertz15}). The remaining seven clusters are defined as ineffective protocols, since in all of them either the remaining tumors are large or the percent of tumors eradicated is very low. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{ClustersFinal.png}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.475\\textwidth]{VennDiagramFinal.png}\\\\\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize{\n({\\bf left}) Partition of all simulated protocols for all four cell lines (A-D) into clusters based on three metrics: the average number of remaining tumor cells, their standard deviations and the percentage of eradicated tumors. Three treatments clusters (circled) have been classified as effective, and the remaining seven clusters as ineffective. The effective green cluster containing 137 elements has an average tumor size of 2.33 cells, a standard deviation of 5.97 and 91.02\\% eradication. The effective red cluster containing 68 elements has an average tumor size of 81.04  cells, a standard deviation of 92.7 and 35\\% eradication.

The four tumor cell lines considered are: A--weak acquired resistance; B--strong acquired resistance; C--weak pre-existing resistance; D--strong pre-existing resistance.}}\n  \\label{figure:VennDiagram}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nAll effective and ineffective protocols for each of the four cell lines were grouped into a four-set Venn diagram shown in the right panel of Fig. \\ref{figure:VennDiagram}, where the non-zero counts of effective [E:] or ineffective [I:] protocols are shown for each of the possible cell line combinations. As expected, for the weakly resistant cells, that is for cells that have a potential but do not generally develop resistance (cases A \\& C in Fig. \\ref{figure:VennDiagram}), several treatment protocols led to tumor eradication. In fact, 93 out of 127 treatment schedules were effective for both A and C, and an additional 8 protocols were effective for cell line C but not A. Interestingly, all protocols in which drug is applied three to seven times a week led to tumor annihilation. In the ineffective schedules, the drug is administered only once a week, or twice a week, but either with an initial delay of treatment or with at least three days of break between the treatments. In the schedules with a smaller number of drug administration days, the amount of drug introduced to the system in each injection is larger. Therefore, our results show that in the case of weak resistance (whether resistance is pre-existing or acquired), fractionated treatment can be successful as long as there are no long breaks between the treatments. In the case of acquired resistance, the breaks between treatments allow the cells in the microenvironmental niches to repair their DNA damage while also acquiring additional resistance. In the case of pre-existing resistance, these breaks permit the intrinsically resistant cells to repair damage while not accumulating significant additional damage. In either case, the result is a delay in cell death, or escape of the cell population from drug control.\n\n\nWhile the metronomic schedule was not successful in the case of strong acquired drug resistance, 22 other schedules (all shared with the weak acquired resistance) were effective. The majority of these protocols start on the first day, and include drug administration on two-three consecutive days. The only two effective 6-day schedules have a break day at the end of a week. Similarly, the only effective 2-day schedule have drug administered in two first days, but in this case the concentration of the drug is quite high. Therefore, in the case of strong acquired resistance, the upfront drug loading, as given by the FD treatments, is required to eradicate the tumor. As already noted in Table \\ref{table:acquired_ranking}, these FD schedules are also more effective than MC for weakly resistant acquired micrometastases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The Role of Tumor Microenvironment}\nThe importance of heterogeneities in the tumor microenvironment, such as an irregular tumor vasculature which results in the formation of drug and metabolite gradients, can be illustrated by comparing how the four tumor cell lines respond to homogeneous vs. heterogeneous drug concentrations. Typically, the drug response curves ($IC_{50}/EC_{50}$) are generated by growing the tumor cells in monolayers (in Petri dishes) for 72 hours. While the drug concentration is constant (homogeneous) in each dish, it progressively increases between the dishes \\cite{TurnerCharlton:2005}. The $EC_{50}$ value is defined as a drug concentration that gives half-maximal response (growth inhibition for the $IC_{50}$) after a specified exposure duration. In our simulations we record the number of cells that have survived a given homogeneous concentration of a drug supplied continuously to the 2D cell culture. The $EC_{50}$ curves for all four cell lines considered in our simulations are presented in Fig. \\ref{figure:EC50}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{IC50_72hrs.png}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize{$EC_{50}$ curves of cancer cell response to a drug. Cell lines shown are: a non-resistant (black), acquired weak resistant (blue), acquired strong resistant (red), pre-existing weak resistant (cyan), and pre-existing strong resistant (magenta). The $EC_{50}$ curves were generated using the 2D cell colony simulations in which cancer cells were exposed to homogeneous drug concentrations for 72 hours. The fitting curves satisfy equation: $y(x)=min + (max - min)/(1+ (\\frac{x}{EC_{50}})^{-\\beta})$, where $min$ and $max$ are the lowest and the highest observed value, and $\\beta$ is the slope of the curve.}}\n\\label{figure:EC50}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nInterestingly, the $EC_{50}$ values do not allow one to identify which population can be eradicated by metronomic therapy in the tissue-based simulations, and which cannot. To elaborate, in the case of acquired resistance, the cell line classified by successful eradication under metronomic therapy (weak resistance) has an $EC_{50}$ value of $0.6$, while the cell line which cannot be eradicated by metronomic therapy (strong resistance) has a comparably small (though slightly larger) $EC_{50}$ value of $0.95$. This is because in the $EC_{50}$ simulations in which all cells were exposed to a constant, time-invariant drug concentration independent of their position in space, the drug-induced DNA damage was evolving faster that its resistance. This is in contrast to  tissue experiments, where the cells were exposed to a variable drug gradient generated by irregularly spaced vessels. As we showed in \\cite{Gevertz15}, the vascular architecture considered in both studies had produced microenvironmental niches that play a crucial role in the development of acquired drug resistance. In fact, when the cells move to the niche of low drug but sufficient oxygen concentrations, the cells are able to increase their DNA damage tolerance level. Since this cellular feature is passed to the daughter cells, the produced subclone can withstand higher levels of drug-induced damage resulting in the development of acquired resistance. \n\n\nIn the case of pre-existing resistance, both the weak and strong resistance cell lines have no defined $EC_{50}$ value, since there is no decrease in their population cell counts, even for extremly high drug concentrations. Yet, MC was able to eradicate a micrometastasis containing approximately 3\\% of the weak pre-existing resistant cells, contrary to what was shown in the $IC_{50}$ experiments. This may be attributed to the short time of the Petri dish experiments compared to the much longer time used in the tissue-based simulation. Alternatively, it could be attributed to the fact that in the tissue model, we initially defined approximately 3\\% of the initial micrometastatic population to have the pre-existing resistant phenotype. Adequate exposure to the drug, along with competition with the sensitive cells that compose the majority of the tumor, may make it harder for the resistant cells to thrive in tissue space than in a Petri dish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}\n\nIn this paper we examined the impact that the dosing protocol for systemic chemotherapy has on the development of drug resistance at metastatic sites. This study utilized a spatial, agent-based model of micrometastasic growth in heterogeneous microenvironments. We showed previously that two specific microenvironmental niches -- the niche with low oxygen content, and the niche with low drug levels but sufficient oxygen concentration -- form sanctuaries in which tumor cells having a chemoresistant potential can give rise to a resistant tumor \\cite{Gevertz15}. Here, four distinct cell populations, each categorized by their response to a DNA-damaging drug, were considered: 1) a population that can weakly acquire resistance; 2) a population that can strongly acquire resistance; 3) a population that is inherently weakly resistant (pre-existing resistance); 4) a population that is inherently strongly resistant. The weakly resistant cell lines were defined by those that could be eradicated by a metronomic (daily, low-dose) treatment schedule. We showed that these weakly resistant cells can be eradicated by a large number of dosing protocols, and further identified three fractionated protocols ([1111000], [1111100], [1101000]) that eradicate tumors faster, on average, than MC for both pre-existing and acquired resistant cell lines (Tables \\ref{table:acquired_ranking}, \\ref{table:pre_eradication_ranking}). This result was quite surprising, as in previous work we showed that the dynamics of pre-existing and acquired resistant cell lines vary in significant ways, with acquired resistance dynamics being highly dependent on the heterogeneous microenvironment, and pre-existing resistance dynamics being mainly driven by the inherent genetic/epigenetic advantage of the resistant cells \\cite{Gevertz15}.  \n\n\nFocusing only on the acquired resistant cell lines, we found that protocols that are the most successful for weakly resistant cells can also eradicate strongly resistant cells that do not respond to metronomic therapy. In particular, if one looks at the list of the fifteen protocols that eradicate weakly acquired micrometastases the fastest, the top eleven protocols for eradicating strongly acquired micrometastases is found within this list (Table \\ref{table:acquired_ranking}). This suggests that the optimal protocol for targeting micrometastases that can acquire resistance to a DNA-damaging drug is not strongly dependent on the rate at which these cells acquire resistance. \n\nIt is desirable to identify a set of effective treatment protocols for all four cell lines. Unfortunately, we found this not to be possible, as no protocol was able to eradicate the strongly pre-existing resistant cells. However, we did discover that one treatment approach would fail independent of the cell line used - the MTD approach where drug is given one day a week at the maximum tolerated dose, with the remaining days of the week being a drug holiday. Independent of which day of the week the one dose was given, in no case did this treatment strategy result in micrometastatic eradication. On the other hand, we did find that the three treatment protocols that were effective in the weakly resistant cell lines (both acquired and pre-existing) were also effective strategies for eradicating strongly acquired resistant cells. This lends further support to the effectiveness of using fractionated protocols with appropriately timed drug holidays in order to target micrometastases which can harbor pre-existing resistance to, or can acquire resistance to, a DNA-damaging drug.\n\n\nIn the future, we plan to extend our analyses to consider micrometastases that can harbor pre-existing resistance to a DNA-damaging drug while simultaneously being able to acquire resistance in response to the drug. This will require developing a thorough understanding of tumor behavior in this two-dimensional parameter space (extent of pre-existing resistance versus acquired resistance), and searching for optimal protocols over different regions of this parameter space. We anticipate a more restricted set of treatments can lead to tumor eradication in this combined resitance case, and therefore we will likely have to extend the set of treatments tested to include protocols where drug dose is not equally distributed over the number of drug-administration days per week. While this would require us to move away from performing an exhaustive search of treatment space, it also expands the class of treatments we can consider to include chemo-switch protocols in which periods of high drug doses are followed by periods of low doses \\cite{Pietras05}, or adaptive therapies in which the specific treatment timing and dosage are determined by tumor response to the previous drug dose \\cite{Gatenby09}. The intention of the current work, coupled with the proposed extension, is to better understand treatment response of micrometastases growing in heterogeneous environments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plain}\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\n\n\n\\medskip\n\nReceived xxxx 20xx; revised xxxx 20xx.\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 25226, "prevtext": "\n\n\\noindent In order to ensure consistency with the predictions made at low drug levels (as analyzed in \\cite{Gevertz15}), we calibrated model parameters and found that the best fit was achieved for $K_{max} = 0.0004$ and $k_n \\approx 2.195\\times 10^{-4}$. Just as in \\cite{Gevertz15}, when the intracellular damage level $C_k^{dam}$ exceeds the death threshold $C_k^{death}$, the cell will die.\n\nIn the case of pre-existing drug resistance, a fixed number of cells will be less sensitive to the DNA damaging drug, meaning they can tolerate more damage than the baseline case. These resistant cells have a death threshold of $C_k^{death} = Thr_{multi}\\times Thr_{death}$, where $Thr_{multi}$ is the pre-existing resistance parameter in the model. The larger $Thr_{multi}$ is, the more resistant this subpopulation of cells is compared to the chemosensitive subpopulation.\n\nIn the case of acquired resistance, the death threshold of each cell $C_k^{death}$ increases independently at the rate $\\Delta_{death}$ if the prolonged drug exposure criterion is met:\n\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nC_k^{death}(t+\\Delta t) = \n\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \nC_k^{death}(t) + \\Delta_{death} & \\mbox{ if } C_k^{exp}(t) > t_{exp} \\\\\nC_k^{death}(t) & \\mbox{ otherwise.}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"C_{k}^{death}(t+\\Delta t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{ll}C_{k}^{death}(t)+\\Delta_{%&#10;death}&amp;\\mbox{ if }C_{k}^{exp}(t)&gt;t_{exp}\\\\&#10;C_{k}^{death}(t)&amp;\\mbox{ otherwise.}\\\\&#10;\\end{array}\\right.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>C</mi><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>C</mi><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mtext>\u00a0if\u00a0</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>C</mi><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>C</mi><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mtext>\u00a0otherwise.</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable><mi/></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
