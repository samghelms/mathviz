The ground state ($k_{||}=0)$ of the lower polariton shifts to higher energy as the density increases, due to the repulsive interpolariton interactions. We defined the ground state energy in each case as $E=0$ so that $\\mu= 0$ corresponds to the condition for Bose-Einstein condensation. The best fits of the data to $N_{BE}(E)$ were determined using $T$ and $\\mu$ as free parameters in nonlinear least-squares regressions, and are shown as solid curves in Fig.~2. \n\nWhen the polariton states are strongly negatively detuned and have very weak interactions, the fits to the Bose-Einstein distribution are poor. As seen in Fig.~2(a), for the case of $\\delta=-5$ meV, at low density the distribution has a reasonable fit to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (which corresponds to a single exponential, i.e., a straight line on a semi-log plot), but as the polariton density is increased, the distribution is no longer fully thermal. The hump at $E = 0.5$ meV is a manifestation of the bottleneck effect, as was also observed in Ref.~\\cite{Kasprzak2008}.  As the density is increased further, a peak occurs which is condensate-like, but the rest of the distribution does not fit the Bose-Einstein functional form in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:BEdistrib}), indicating that the polaritons are not in thermal equilibrium.  This behavior is similar to that seen in many other experiments with short-lifetime polaritons, e.g.~Ref \\cite{Kasprzak2006, Kasprzak2008}, and is consistent with a nonequilibrium polariton condensate. The nonequilibrium distribution has been reproduced by numerical solution to the quantum Boltzmann equation \\cite{Hartwell2010}. Despite the long cavity lifetime, the photon-like polaritons with weak interactions do not reach thermal equilibrium.\n\nIn contrast, $N(E)$ at $\\delta=0$ is well described by $N_{BE}(E)$ for all pump powers up to $P=1.1P_{BE}$. At pump powers well below $P_{BE}$, $N(E)$ is well described by a single exponential function, i.e., a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  Between $P=0.9P_{BE}$ and $P=1.1P_{BE}$, an upturn in the distribution at $E=0$ meV is observed, indicating that $N(E)$ deviates from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and must be described by a Bose-Einstein distribution with the reduced chemical potential $|\\mu/k_BT| < 1$. The fit values of $T$ and $\\mu$ used in Fig.~2b are shown in Fig.~3 as the blue symbols. As seen in this figure, when the density is increased, $T$ decreases from around 20 K to a lowest value of $13.9 \\pm 0.2$ K and $\\mu/k_BT$ smoothly goes from $-2.93 \\pm 0.16$ to $-0.28 \\pm 0.01$. For pump powers greater than $1.1P_{BE}$, a condensate in the ground state appears. This peak cannot be fit to an ideal Bose-Einstein distribution, and we believe that the reason is the appearance of many-body effects such as the Bogoliubov linear spectrum and depletion of the condensate due to interactions. The high-energy tail of the top two curves has the same absolute value, indicating that the population in the excited states saturates when there is a condensate, consistent with a Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition for bosons in thermal equilibrium. \n\n \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{Fig3}\n    \\caption{ (color online).

Previous reports using short-lifetime samples \\cite{Deng2006,Kasprzak2008} showed fits of $N(E)$ without the clear upturn near $E=0$ at excitonic detunings; although a condensate peak appeared in some cases, there was not a clear density-dependent evolution from a thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to a degenerate Bose-Einstein, non-condensed distribution. Furthermore, short-lifetime samples thermalized only when the microcavity was positively detuned \\cite{Deng2006} and the polariton characteristics were mostly exciton-like so that the motion of the polaritons was severely restricted (see Supplementary Materials for a detailed discussion). In contrast, the long lifetime polaritons seen here at zero detuning follow Bose-Einstein statistics throughout the phase transition and propagate to fill the trap in spatial equilibrium. \n\nWe emphasize that not only the curvature of the fits in Fig.~2 but also the absolute vertical scale of the fits is constrained by the value of $\\mu$. We do not have a free parameter to change the overall intensity scaling factor for each curve. The data points give the absolute occupation numbers as indicated by the vertical scale in addition to the relative occupation numbers at different pump powers. When the value of $\\mu$ in the Bose-Einstein distribution is increased toward zero, this increases the absolute value of $N_{BE}(E)$. Thus, the fits are tightly constrained by the requirement that we fit not only the shape of the distribution but also the relative heights of all the curves with only two parameters, $T$ and $\\mu$. This constraint is reflected in the very small relative uncertainties in the fit values of $\\mu$ shown in Fig.~3b. \n\n\\vspace*{0.35cm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Characteristics of equilibrium polariton condensates at different bath temperatures}\n\n\\noindent The bath temperature was also varied in the range of 10.0--25.0 K. Good thermalization has been achieved across this range (see Supplementary Materials for plots of distributions at different bath temperatures). In Fig. 3, we plot the fitted values of $T$ and $\\mu/k_BT$ for different pump powers. As can be seen, when the bath temperature is low, the fit values of $T$ at low densities are much higher than $T_{bath}$ and at higher densities they settle to temperatures slightly above $T_{bath}$, while for a bath temperature of $T = 22.5$ K, the fitted temperatures stay pinned to the bath temperature, within the uncertainty. The chemical potential increases smoothly toward zero in each case as the density is increased.\n\nSince the polaritons are well characterized by the fits to Bose-Einstein distributions, we obtain the total number of polaritons by extrapolating the fitted distributions $N(E)$ of polaritons as shown in Fig.~2 to high energies, and then integrating over the energy, and multiplying by the density of states, using the standard formula\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15908, "prevtext": "\n\\title{Bose-Einstein Condensation of Long-Lifetime Polaritons in Thermal Equilibrium}\n\\author{Yongbao Sun,$^{1}{}^\\ast$  Patrick Wen,$^{1}$ Yoseob Yoon,$^{1}$ Gangqiang Liu,$^{2}$ Mark Steger,$^{2}$\\\\ Loren N.

However, in these experiments, the polaritons have not reached thermal equilibrium when they undergo the transition to a coherent state. This has prevented the verification of one of the canonical predictions for condensation, namely the phase diagram. In this work, we have created a polariton gas in a semiconductor microcavity in which the quasiparticles have a lifetime much longer than their thermalization time. This allows them to reach thermal equilibrium in a laser-generated confining trap. Their energy distributions are well fit by equilibrium Bose-Einstein distributions over a broad range of densities and temperatures from very low densities all the way up to the threshold for Bose-Einstein condensation. The good fits of the Bose-Einstein distribution  over a broad range of density and temperature imply that the particles obey the predicted power law for the phase boundary of Bose-Einstein condensation. \n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle \n\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Introduction}\n\n\\noindent The realization of polariton condensation in semiconductor microcavities from liquid helium temperature \\cite{Kasprzak2006, Balili2007} all the way up to room temperature \\cite{Christopoulos2007, Kena-Cohen2010, Plumhof2014}  presents great opportunities both for fundamental studies of many-body physics and for all-optical devices on the technology side. Exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity are admixtures of the confined light modes of the cavity and excitonic transitions, typically those of excitons in semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) placed at the antinodes of the cavity. Despite the similarities between polaritons and cold atoms, as demonstrated by the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) \\cite{Kasprzak2006, Balili2007, Christopoulos2007, Kena-Cohen2010, Plumhof2014}, superfluidity \\cite{Amo2009}, and quantized vortices \\cite{Lagoudakis2008, Lagoudakis2009, Sanvitto2010, Nardin2011, Tosi2012}, polaritons possess many unique features, among which is finite intrinsic lifetime. In most previous experiments, the lifetime of the polaritons in microcavities has been 30 ps or less \\cite{Wertz2010}. This is enough time for particles to thermalize partially but not fully \\cite{Deng2006, Kasprzak2008}, which has led to the common description of polariton condensates as ``nonequilibrium condensates'' \\cite{Szymanska2006}.  In typical experiments, the polariton gas is far from equilibrium at low density and reaches a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at moderate densities, but then as density increases toward the BEC threshold, the particle distribution cannot be fit by an equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution with a meaningful chemical potential (See the Supplementary Materials for a review of earlier data). \n\nThe theory of nonequilibrium condensation is an active field \\cite{Szymanska2006,Wouters2010,Hartwell2010, Keeling2011,Smith2012}, and polariton experiments and theory have shown that a great number of canonical features of condensation persist in nonequilibrium. Debates persist over whether polariton condensates can be called true Bose-Einstein condensates \\cite{Butov2007, Butov2012, Deveaud-Pledran2012}, in part related to the question of whether polariton condensation is intrinsically a nonequilibrium effect. Although many effects in polariton experiments do not depend on whether the polaritons reach thermal equilibrium or not, it is of fundamental importance to investigate that whether polariton condensates can reach thermal equilibrium. Strictly speaking, BEC cannot occur in an ideal infinite 2D system, but it has been shown \\cite{Holzmann2007, Berman2008} that a 2D Bose gas in a large but finite trap has the same threshold behavior as a 3D Bose gas in a finite trap of the same type. It is therefore appropriate to talk of BEC in 2D and 3D finite trapped systems using the same language. \n\nIn this paper, we report the observation of fully thermalized polaritons all the way up to the Bose condensation threshold, in an exceptionally high-$Q$ microcavity structure in a laser-generated annular trap under non-resonant excitation. The high $Q$ corresponds to a long polariton lifetime, allowing polaritons to propagate to the center of the trap \\cite{interactions} and establish both spatial and thermal equilibrium. The measured distributions can be fit well by the equilibrium Bose-Einstein model over a broad range of densities and bath temperatures. The temperature values extracted from the fits follow the measured bath temperatures closely. The chemical potentials determined from the fits give predictions for the polariton densities that agree well with independent measurements of the densities. \n\n\\vspace*{0.35cm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Trapping polaritons in a high-$Q$ microcavity} \n\n\\noindent The main challenge in reaching full thermalization in polariton systems is to achieve a very long polariton lifetime, longer than their thermalization time. The thermalization time for the polariton gas was estimated to be at least 40 ps for polaritons that are mostly exciton-like \\cite{Deng2006}, and can be even longer for more photon-like polaritons (see Supplementary Materials for a discussion of how to vary the exciton/photon component through use of a wedged microcavity whose variable widths yield cavity resonance frequencies that are positively or negatively detuned from the exciton resonance frequency). However, most samples used in previous experiments have polariton lifetimes on the order of a few picoseconds due to leakage of light out of the cavities. This suggests that an improvement of the cavity $Q$ by at least an order of magnitude is needed, which is not trivial for GaAs fabrication technology. A GaAs-based high-$Q$ microcavity structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) was used in the measurements. The main change from samples used in previous experiments \\cite{Balili2007} was to double the number of the quarter-wavelength layers in the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) that make up the mirrors of the cavity; detailed recipe and the difficulties involved in fabricating a long lifetime sample are described in the Supplementary Materials. The new microcavity structure has a $Q$ of $\\sim$320,000 and a cavity photon lifetime of $\\sim$135 ps. This corresponds to a polariton lifetime of 270 ps at resonance, which has been confirmed by the long-range (millimeter scale) propagation of polaritons created through either resonant \\cite{Steger2015} or non-resonant \\cite{Steger2013} optical excitation. \n\nDue to the light effective mass and inefficient scattering with phonons, polaritons can propagate over long distances, up to millimeters when they are mostly photonic \\cite{Steger2013,Steger2015}. In order to guide them toward equilibrium with a specified location and geometry, we made a spatial trap.  We made use of the fact that excitons in the same structure have much larger effective mass than that of the polaritons; the typical polariton mass is less than $10^{-4}$ times the electron mass, while the free exciton mass is on the order of a tenth of an electron mass. Therefore, the excitons created by non-resonant optical excitation are essentially static as seen by polaritons, and the repulsion of the polaritons by the excitons acts as a static potential energy barrier. This method has been used previously in several experiments to confine polaritons \\cite{Tosi2012_2,Cristofolini2013, interactions, Askitopoulos2013, Askitopoulos2015}.\n\nThe 2D annular trap in this work was formed by irradiating a high-resolution spatial light modulator (SLM) with a pixel density of $1920\\times1080$ by a commercial continuous wave (c.w.) laser. The SLM was used for shaping the incident Gaussian beam into a specified intensity pattern. We imposed a conical prism phase map onto the SLM which was placed at the Fourier plane of an imaging lens. At the conjugate plane of this lens, the beam was transformed into a ring-shaped pattern with a diameter of $\\sim$2 mm. With another two pairs of telescopes, a ring-shaped beam with a diameter of 38 $\\mu$m was formed at the microcavity, as shown in Fig 1a. The wavelength of the c.w. laser was tuned to 720 nm, about 125 meV above the lower polariton resonance, to match the second reflection minimum above the stop band of the cavity at resonance (see Supplementary Materials for details). This generates a high density of free carriers along the ring. Non-resonant excitation of this type guarantees that the phase coherence of the pump laser is lost in the many-phonon scattering events through which the hot carriers relax into cold polaritons, and any coherence in the system arises spontaneously at sufficiently high density due to the nature of Bose-Einstein condensation. In order to avoid unwanted sample heating, the c.w. laser light was gated by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) at 1 kHz repetition rate with a duty cycle of 0.5\\%. In Fig.~1b, we show the normalized light intensity plot for the $x=0$ slice of the ring pattern in Fig.~1a. The light intensity in the center is nearly negligible; as discussed above, it gives rise to a nearly flat potential for the polaritons in the center of the ring, in which the variation in energy is much less than $k_BT$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Fig1}\n    \\caption{ (color online). (a) Reflection of the excitation beam from the sample surface. The white circle indicates the region of the sample that is observed in photoluminescence (PL) imaging measurements after spatial filtering.

The PL within the solid white lines is collected and imaged onto the spectrometer CCD in the far-field geometry for the polariton distribution measurements. The dashed white line indicates the photon energy gradient deduced from the low-density spectrum.}\n \\end{figure}\n\nThe formation of a 2D polariton trap was verified by measuring the energy of the lower polariton state as a function of sample position. A near-field image of the sample surface was imaged onto the entrance slit of an imaging spectrometer. The spectrometer slit selected the $x=0$ slice of the near-field image and was then spectrally dispersed on the spectrometer CCD. The resulting image, plotted in Fig.~1c for the case of moderate pump power below the condensation threshold, shows the intensity of the photoluminescence (PL) emitted by lower polaritons as a function of both the PL energy and the sample position. The white dashed line indicates the emission energies at very low pump powers; the slope of this line arises from the wedge of the cavity thickness, which causes a gradient in the cavity photon energy. At the pump region, there is a blue shift of the polariton energy due to their interactions with each other as well as from repulsive interactions between polaritons and excitons and free carriers. As seen in Fig.~1c, the barrier is not constant around the ring, varying by about 1 meV from one side to the other due to inhomogeneity in the pump intensity. The barrier is slightly wider than the laser profile, because excitons propagate up to 10 $\\mu$m. The potential landscape is nearly flat in the region from -11 $\\mu$m to 11 $\\mu$m indicated by the white circle in Fig.~1a and the horizontal lines in Fig.~1b and 1c.  PL was collected from only this region for determinations of the polariton energy distribution as discussed below. The nearly flat potential profile corresponds to a constant density of states in 2D. Additionally, a nearly homogeneous distribution was established in the field of view, as evidenced by little change in the energy-resolved emission intensities in Fig.~1c (see Fig. S6 in Ref.~\\cite{interactions} for a direct measurement of spatial profiles under similar conditions). \n\nPolaritons are generated in the pump region and stream away in all directions.  However, only polaritons that propagate into the center of the trap can meet and interact,  leading to the accumulation of the densities high enough for condensation. A near-field image of the sample was projected onto a spatial filter at a reconstructed real-space plane of the sample surface to select only the PL from inside the trap (within the white circle in Fig.~1a), and a far-field image of the PL that passed through the spatial filter was projected onto an imaging spectrometer, giving the intensity of the PL, $I$, as function of both the in-plane wavevector component, $k_{||}$, and the corresponding energy, $E(k_{||})$. The dispersion $E(k_{||})$ is illustrated in Fig.~S3. Finally, $I[E(k_{||})]$ was converted into the number of polaritons, $N[E(k_{||})]$ (hereafter simply $N(E)$),  by the use of one single efficiency factor throughout the experiments. Detailed information about how to determine the efficiency factor can be found in Ref.~\\cite{interactions}. Crucially, the same efficiency factor was used for all the distributions so that the absolute occupation numbers of different distributions could be compared.\n\n\\vspace*{0.35cm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Varying the polariton gas from nonequilibrium to equilibrium} \n\n\\noindent To see the effect of interactions on thermalization, $N(E)$ was measured at two different cavity detunings, $\\delta=-5$ meV and $\\delta=0$ meV, for a series of pump powers. The detuning $\\delta$ is the energy difference between the cavity resonance and exciton energy at $k_{||}=0$.  Changing the detuning changes the underlying excitonic fraction of the polaritons, which governs their interactions. Positive values of detunings indicates polaritons are more exciton-like, while negative values of detunings give polaritons which are mostly photon-like.  Here $\\delta = 0$ meV and $\\delta = -5$ meV correspond to excitonic fractions of 50\\% and 30\\%, respectively.  This indicates that the polaritons with $\\delta=-5$ meV have interactions which are weaker by a factor of 3 than those at $\\delta = 0$ meV, and less well thermalization is expected. \n\n \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{Fig2}\n    \\caption{ (color online).

We can define the threshold for crossover from classical to Bose-Einstein statistics as the case when $N(0) \\sim 1$, or we can define the threshold for condensation, or quasi-condensation, when $N(0) \\gg 1$, e.g., $N(0) \\sim 10$. Whichever threshold for $N(0)$ we pick, Eq.~(\\ref{NE}) implies the same scaling law, namely that the total number $N_{tot}$ at the critical threshold will be proportional to the temperature $T$. This is equivalent to a dimensional analysis of the onset of quantum effects when the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda_{T}$ is comparable to the average interparticle distance $r_s$, which for a  two-dimensional system gives\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr_s \\sim n^{-1/2} \\sim \\lambda_{T} \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{mk_BT}}.\n\\label{eq:rs}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand therefore $n\\propto T$.\n\nThe fit values of $T$ at the critical threshold are plotted in Fig.~5a, showing the general trend of $T_{BE}$ slightly higher than $T_{bath}$, as discussed earlier. The relative deviation is highest at low bath temperature, when the heat capacity of the sample is lowest, allowing the local sample temperature to rise more due to the laser heating. \n\n \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\textwidth]{Fig5}\n    \\caption{ (color online).

The solid black line shows the best fit of a linear relation $N_{BE} \\propto  T_{BE}$.}\n \\end{figure}\nFig.~5b shows the phase diagram implied by the good fits to our thermalized data. We defined the threshold of quantum degeneracy as $N(0)=1$, which corresponds to a Bose-Einstein distribution with $\\mu/k_BT=-\\ln2$, shown by the black dashed line in Fig.~4. For each bath temperature, \nthe threshold pump power $P_{BE}$ was chosen which gave a fit value of $\\mu/k_BT$ closest to $-\\ln2$. The fit value of $T$ at this threshold and the total occupation number from Eq.~(2) then give us the phase boundary, plotted as the blue symbols in Fig.~5b. The solid black lines are the best linear fit. Above the line, the polariton gas is quantum-degenerate, and below it, the gas is classical. \n\nIt has been a longstanding assumption that the Bose condensation effects seen in polariton systems are a direct result of the quantum nature of the system when $r_s \\sim \\lambda_{T}$, but up to now it has not been possible to directly test this.  By using high-quality microcavities with lifetimes over an order of magnitude longer than those of previous samples, polaritons within a two-dimensional flat optical trap are seen to unambiguously show thermal Bose-Einstein statistics. This clearly distinguishes polariton condensation from the conventional lasing effect in semiconductor materials. \n\nNow that we have samples in which true equilibrium can be established, new experiments are possible to test theoretical predictions of interacting Bose gas theory which have been elusive in cold atom experiments. For example, studies can be conducted of the excitation spectrum of the interacting Bose gas, and of the crossover from 2D to 1D equilibrium which can be controlled by spatial shaping of the excitation light to make tailored potential energy landscapes. Characteristics of the nonequilibrium state can also be studied systematically by varying the cavity detuning to control the polariton interaction strength. Dynamical relaxation into the equilibrium state can also be studied by using pulsed rather than c.w. excitation followed by time-resolved measurements, as well as the coherence properties as the system passes through the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. \n\n\\bibliographystyle{sciencemag}\n\\bibliography{thermalization}\n\n\\vspace*{.5cm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS} \\\\\nY.S., P.W., Y.Y. and K.A.N were supported as part of the Center for Excitonics, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001088.

For the case of a single microcavity mode and a single exciton transition, two polariton modes, the upper and lower polaritons, are formed with energies $E_{LP}(k_{||})$ and $E_{UP}(k_{||})$ given by:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 22923, "prevtext": "\nwhere $T$ and $\\mu$ are the temperature and chemical potential of the polaritons, respectively, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The ground state ($k_{||}=0)$ of the lower polariton shifts to higher energy as the density increases, due to the repulsive interpolariton interactions. We defined the ground state energy in each case as $E=0$ so that $\\mu= 0$ corresponds to the condition for Bose-Einstein condensation. The best fits of the data to $N_{BE}(E)$ were determined using $T$ and $\\mu$ as free parameters in nonlinear least-squares regressions, and are shown as solid curves in Fig.~2. \n\nWhen the polariton states are strongly negatively detuned and have very weak interactions, the fits to the Bose-Einstein distribution are poor. As seen in Fig.~2(a), for the case of $\\delta=-5$ meV, at low density the distribution has a reasonable fit to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (which corresponds to a single exponential, i.e., a straight line on a semi-log plot), but as the polariton density is increased, the distribution is no longer fully thermal. The hump at $E = 0.5$ meV is a manifestation of the bottleneck effect, as was also observed in Ref.~\\cite{Kasprzak2008}.  As the density is increased further, a peak occurs which is condensate-like, but the rest of the distribution does not fit the Bose-Einstein functional form in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:BEdistrib}), indicating that the polaritons are not in thermal equilibrium.  This behavior is similar to that seen in many other experiments with short-lifetime polaritons, e.g.~Ref \\cite{Kasprzak2006, Kasprzak2008}, and is consistent with a nonequilibrium polariton condensate. The nonequilibrium distribution has been reproduced by numerical solution to the quantum Boltzmann equation \\cite{Hartwell2010}. Despite the long cavity lifetime, the photon-like polaritons with weak interactions do not reach thermal equilibrium.\n\nIn contrast, $N(E)$ at $\\delta=0$ is well described by $N_{BE}(E)$ for all pump powers up to $P=1.1P_{BE}$. At pump powers well below $P_{BE}$, $N(E)$ is well described by a single exponential function, i.e., a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  Between $P=0.9P_{BE}$ and $P=1.1P_{BE}$, an upturn in the distribution at $E=0$ meV is observed, indicating that $N(E)$ deviates from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and must be described by a Bose-Einstein distribution with the reduced chemical potential $|\\mu/k_BT| < 1$. The fit values of $T$ and $\\mu$ used in Fig.~2b are shown in Fig.~3 as the blue symbols. As seen in this figure, when the density is increased, $T$ decreases from around 20 K to a lowest value of $13.9 \\pm 0.2$ K and $\\mu/k_BT$ smoothly goes from $-2.93 \\pm 0.16$ to $-0.28 \\pm 0.01$. For pump powers greater than $1.1P_{BE}$, a condensate in the ground state appears. This peak cannot be fit to an ideal Bose-Einstein distribution, and we believe that the reason is the appearance of many-body effects such as the Bogoliubov linear spectrum and depletion of the condensate due to interactions. The high-energy tail of the top two curves has the same absolute value, indicating that the population in the excited states saturates when there is a condensate, consistent with a Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition for bosons in thermal equilibrium. \n\n \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{Fig3}\n    \\caption{ (color online).

Previous reports using short-lifetime samples \\cite{Deng2006,Kasprzak2008} showed fits of $N(E)$ without the clear upturn near $E=0$ at excitonic detunings; although a condensate peak appeared in some cases, there was not a clear density-dependent evolution from a thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to a degenerate Bose-Einstein, non-condensed distribution. Furthermore, short-lifetime samples thermalized only when the microcavity was positively detuned \\cite{Deng2006} and the polariton characteristics were mostly exciton-like so that the motion of the polaritons was severely restricted (see Supplementary Materials for a detailed discussion). In contrast, the long lifetime polaritons seen here at zero detuning follow Bose-Einstein statistics throughout the phase transition and propagate to fill the trap in spatial equilibrium. \n\nWe emphasize that not only the curvature of the fits in Fig.~2 but also the absolute vertical scale of the fits is constrained by the value of $\\mu$. We do not have a free parameter to change the overall intensity scaling factor for each curve. The data points give the absolute occupation numbers as indicated by the vertical scale in addition to the relative occupation numbers at different pump powers. When the value of $\\mu$ in the Bose-Einstein distribution is increased toward zero, this increases the absolute value of $N_{BE}(E)$. Thus, the fits are tightly constrained by the requirement that we fit not only the shape of the distribution but also the relative heights of all the curves with only two parameters, $T$ and $\\mu$. This constraint is reflected in the very small relative uncertainties in the fit values of $\\mu$ shown in Fig.~3b. \n\n\\vspace*{0.35cm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Characteristics of equilibrium polariton condensates at different bath temperatures}\n\n\\noindent The bath temperature was also varied in the range of 10.0--25.0 K. Good thermalization has been achieved across this range (see Supplementary Materials for plots of distributions at different bath temperatures). In Fig. 3, we plot the fitted values of $T$ and $\\mu/k_BT$ for different pump powers. As can be seen, when the bath temperature is low, the fit values of $T$ at low densities are much higher than $T_{bath}$ and at higher densities they settle to temperatures slightly above $T_{bath}$, while for a bath temperature of $T = 22.5$ K, the fitted temperatures stay pinned to the bath temperature, within the uncertainty. The chemical potential increases smoothly toward zero in each case as the density is increased.\n\nSince the polaritons are well characterized by the fits to Bose-Einstein distributions, we obtain the total number of polaritons by extrapolating the fitted distributions $N(E)$ of polaritons as shown in Fig.~2 to high energies, and then integrating over the energy, and multiplying by the density of states, using the standard formula\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nN_{\\textrm{tot}}= \\frac{gAm_{LP}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\int_0^\\infty N(E)dE\n\\label{NE}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N_{\\textrm{tot}}=\\frac{gAm_{LP}}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}N(E)dE\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mtext>tot</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u210f</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></msubsup><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02581.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $k_{||}$ is the wave vector in the plane perpendicular to the microcavity confinement direction, $E_X(k_{||})$ is the energy of the exciton transition, $E_C(k_{||})$ is the energy of the cavity mode, $\\delta(k_{||})$ is the detuning energy defined as $\\delta(k_{||})=E_C(k_{||})-E_X(k_{||})$, and $\\Omega$ is the strength of radiative coupling between the exciton and cavity field, also known as full Rabi splitting energy.

We can define the threshold for crossover from classical to Bose-Einstein statistics as the case when $N(0) \\sim 1$, or we can define the threshold for condensation, or quasi-condensation, when $N(0) \\gg 1$, e.g., $N(0) \\sim 10$. Whichever threshold for $N(0)$ we pick, Eq.~(\\ref{NE}) implies the same scaling law, namely that the total number $N_{tot}$ at the critical threshold will be proportional to the temperature $T$. This is equivalent to a dimensional analysis of the onset of quantum effects when the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda_{T}$ is comparable to the average interparticle distance $r_s$, which for a  two-dimensional system gives\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr_s \\sim n^{-1/2} \\sim \\lambda_{T} \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{mk_BT}}.\n\\label{eq:rs}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand therefore $n\\propto T$.\n\nThe fit values of $T$ at the critical threshold are plotted in Fig.~5a, showing the general trend of $T_{BE}$ slightly higher than $T_{bath}$, as discussed earlier. The relative deviation is highest at low bath temperature, when the heat capacity of the sample is lowest, allowing the local sample temperature to rise more due to the laser heating. \n\n \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\textwidth]{Fig5}\n    \\caption{ (color online).

The solid black line shows the best fit of a linear relation $N_{BE} \\propto  T_{BE}$.}\n \\end{figure}\nFig.~5b shows the phase diagram implied by the good fits to our thermalized data. We defined the threshold of quantum degeneracy as $N(0)=1$, which corresponds to a Bose-Einstein distribution with $\\mu/k_BT=-\\ln2$, shown by the black dashed line in Fig.~4. For each bath temperature, \nthe threshold pump power $P_{BE}$ was chosen which gave a fit value of $\\mu/k_BT$ closest to $-\\ln2$. The fit value of $T$ at this threshold and the total occupation number from Eq.~(2) then give us the phase boundary, plotted as the blue symbols in Fig.~5b. The solid black lines are the best linear fit. Above the line, the polariton gas is quantum-degenerate, and below it, the gas is classical. \n\nIt has been a longstanding assumption that the Bose condensation effects seen in polariton systems are a direct result of the quantum nature of the system when $r_s \\sim \\lambda_{T}$, but up to now it has not been possible to directly test this.  By using high-quality microcavities with lifetimes over an order of magnitude longer than those of previous samples, polaritons within a two-dimensional flat optical trap are seen to unambiguously show thermal Bose-Einstein statistics. This clearly distinguishes polariton condensation from the conventional lasing effect in semiconductor materials. \n\nNow that we have samples in which true equilibrium can be established, new experiments are possible to test theoretical predictions of interacting Bose gas theory which have been elusive in cold atom experiments. For example, studies can be conducted of the excitation spectrum of the interacting Bose gas, and of the crossover from 2D to 1D equilibrium which can be controlled by spatial shaping of the excitation light to make tailored potential energy landscapes. Characteristics of the nonequilibrium state can also be studied systematically by varying the cavity detuning to control the polariton interaction strength. Dynamical relaxation into the equilibrium state can also be studied by using pulsed rather than c.w. excitation followed by time-resolved measurements, as well as the coherence properties as the system passes through the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. \n\n\\bibliographystyle{sciencemag}\n\\bibliography{thermalization}\n\n\\vspace*{.5cm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS} \\\\\nY.S., P.W., Y.Y. and K.A.N were supported as part of the Center for Excitonics, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001088.

In Ref.~\\cite{Kasprzak2008}, the polariton condensate in CdTe-based samples was studied over a wide range of lattice temperatures. In the reported data, the distributions $ N(E)$ were of two types. At high temperature at low density, the distributions fit a classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. At low temperature and high density, the distributions  had a peak at $E=0$,  but could not be fit by an equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution with a well-defined temperature and chemical potential. For example, in the curve for $T$ = 5.3 K in Fig.~1a of Ref.~\\cite{Kasprzak2008}, the best fit to an equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution missed the data by about a factor of 10 at low energy. There was no comparison of the data at different densities, so that the meaningfulness of the fit values of chemical potential (in particular, the prediction of the absolute number of particles from the chemical potential) could not be verified. The interaction strength of the polaritons was varied by changing the detuning, and it was shown that the distributions became much farther from equilibrium as the interaction strength decreased. \n\nIn Ref.~\\cite{Deng2006}, the interaction strength was also varied by changing the detuning, and it was shown that for weak interactions, the distribution $N(E)$ was far from equilibrium, while for strongly excitonic detuning (6 to 9 meV), the distribution became more thermalized. Reasonable fits to a Bose-Einstein equilibrium distribution were reported, but the system as a whole was still strongly in nonequilibrium. An intense pulsed laser was used, which gave a rapidly changing temperature and density of the polaritons on time scales of tens of picoseconds. It could be argued, however, that on short time scales of 1-2 picoseconds, the gas could be considered to be in quasi-equilibrium. More significantly, the strongly excitonic nature of the polaritons gave them a very short mean free path, which implies a very low diffusion constant. Since the polaritons were generated with a single laser spot, this led to an inhomogeneous spatial distribution. The momentum-space data were collected by integrating over the entire spatial profile. In this type of experiment with short-lifetime polaritons and a single Gaussian laser excitation spot, the potential-energy profile felt by the polaritons is strongly renormalized, leading to both self-trapping of the condensate in a small, quasi-harmonic potential inside the laser spot \\cite{Deng2003}, and free streaming away from the spot \\cite{Richard2005}. In general, it has been shown that integration of a spatially inhomogeneous distribution can lead to misleading fits to a Bose-Einstein distribution \\cite{OHara2000}, although reasonable assumptions for density and temperature variations can give fits with an average temperature and chemical potential \\cite{Snoke1990}. \n\nLater work by the same group \\cite{Roumpos2012} with the same short-lifetime structure used a large laser spot with a flat intensity profile and resonant detuning that gave longer mean free path to reduce the spatial inhomogeneity. In this configuration, the spatial coherence properties were measured. The power law for the spatial coherence was found to depend crucially on the nonequilibrium nature of the polariton gas \\cite{Roumpos2012, Dagvadorj2015}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\subfloat{\\includegraphics[width=0.32\\textwidth]{FigS4}} \n\\subfloat{\\includegraphics[width=0.32\\textwidth]{FigS9}} \n\\subfloat{\\includegraphics[width=0.32\\textwidth]{FigS5}} \n\\caption{Energy distributions of polaritons (dots) and the best fits to equilibrium Bose-Einstein model (solid lines)  at a bath temperature of $T=10.0$ K (a), $T=17.5$K (b) and $T=25.0$  K(c), with corresponding threshold pump powers $P_{BE}=435$ mW, $P_{BE} = 474$ mW, and $P_{BE} = 557$ mW, respectively. }\n\\label{Edistribution}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\vspace*{.3cm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{\\textrm{Energy distributions at different temperatures.}} In Fig.~\\ref{Edistribution}, we show the energy distributions at three representative  bath temperatures, i.e., $T_{bath}=10.0$ K, $T_{bath}=17.5$ K and $T_{bath} = 25.0$ K, in our measurements for a series of pump powers.
