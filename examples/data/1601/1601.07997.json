However molecules actually occur in a wide variety of\nenvironments many of them significantly hotter including planetary nebulae,\natmospheres of (exo-)planets, brown dwarfs and cool stars. This makes\nthe radiative and cooling properties of the molecules important for models\nof these species. Indeed, although interstellar molecular clouds are\nusually characterised as cold, they are not really fully thermalised.\nWhether a species, or state of that species, is thermalised depends\non the critical density which is given by the ratio of the radiative\nlifetime of the state to the rate for collisional excitation to the state.\nIn such regions radiative lifetimes are also important for models\nof the many species which are observed to mase.\nThe long lifetimes associated with certain excited states can lead\nto population trapping and non-thermal distributions. Such behaviour\nhas been observed for the H$_3^+$ molecule both\nin space \\cite{02GoMcGe.H3+,05OkGeGo.H3+} and the laboratory\n\\cite{jt306,jt340}, in both cases leading to state distributions\nwhich had not been anticipated.\n\nStates with short radiative lifetimes are important for direct laser cooling of polar\ndiatomic molecules, a topic which  has recently attracted significant interest \\cite{10ShBaDe.SrF}.\n\n\nCooling functions are important in a variety of environments. For\nexample cooling by H$_3^+$ is known to be important in the atmospheres\nof solar system gas giants \\cite{jt498} and, it has been suggested,\nvital to stability of so-called ``hot Jupiter'' exoplanets\n\\cite{kam07}.  Similarly, cooling functions are important in the\nprimordeal Universe for the formation of the first stars \\cite{abel}\nand galaxies \\cite{b20,bromm}. At temperatures below about 8000 K, this\ncooling is almost entirely provided by molecules \\cite{jt489}. Although\ncooling functions are available for some key diatomics \\cite{jt506} and\nthere have been several attempts to provide cooling functions\nfor H$_3^+$ \\cite{jt181,jt489,jt551}, there are no systematic\ncompilations of these. Indeed cooling functions for many key species,\nsuch as water, do not appear to be available.\n\n\nThe ExoMol project \\cite{jt528} has been undertaking the systematic\ncalculation of very extensive spectroscopic line lists for molecules\ndeemed to be important for the study of  exoplanet and other hot atmospheres.\nThese line lists provide comprehensive datasets of a molecule's\nradiative properties. Here we use these datasets to systematically\nstudy radiative lifetimes of comprehensive sets of states and to compute\ntemperature-dependent cooling functions for molecules considered as part of the\nExoMol project.\n\n\n\\section{Theory}\n\nThe results of ExoMol calculations have, up until now, been stored in\ntwo files \\cite{jt548}: a states file comprising one, numbered line\nper state which gives the energy level of the state plus associated\nquantum numbers, and a transitions file with gives a list of Einstein\nA coefficients, $A_{if}$, plus the numbers of the initial, $i$, and\nfinal, $f$, states which, in turn, refer back to the states file.\nThe lifetime of state $i$, $\\tau_i$, can be computed by summing\nover A coefficients:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\tau_i =  \\frac{1}{\\sum_f A_{if}}~.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\tau_{i}=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{f}A_{if}}~{}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>f</mi></msub><msub><mi>A</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mpadded></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07997.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\nu_{if}$ is the wavenumber of the transition $i \\to f$,\n\n$J_i$ is the rotational quantum number of the initial state and $g_i$ is its nuclear\nspin degeneracy factor.

Examples are analysed below with complete sets of data\nbeing placed on the ExoMol website (www.exomol.com). While the ExoMol\nline lists are very extensive, with a few exceptions\n\\cite{jt347,jtpoz}, they are not complete.  Instead the project aims\nto provide comprehensive line lists which are effectively complete for a given\nupper temperature and range of wavelengths. These choices vary with\nthe expected stability of a given species but typical objectives are the\nprovision of a\nline list which represents all absorbtion longwards of 1 $\\mu$m (at\nwavenumbers below 10~000 cm$^{-1}$) for temperatures up to 3000~K.\nIn general these parameter ranges are increased for diatomics species which may be\nstable in environments as hot as\nour Sun's photosphere (almost 6000 K) and for which absorptions at visible\nwavelengths are of importance. Conversely, for large molecules such\nas nitric acid (HNO$_3$) the range of temperatures considered\nis significantly reduced, to only 500 K in this case \\cite{jt614}. These\nchoices are partially influenced by practical considerations as calculations\non polyatomic systems become very  computationally expensive \\cite{jt564}.\nThese considerations influence the states for which lifetime data is\npresented below.\n\nBy definition the ground state of all systems considered has an infinite\nlifetime to radiative decay. Some excited states also do not have\nallowed radiative decay routes, for example where these are forbidden\nby nuclear spin considerations. In principle, radiative nuclear spin\ntransitions which interchange ortho and para nuclear spin isomers can\noccur but they are extremely weak \\cite{jt329} and such\ntransitions are not considered\nas part  of ExoMol. States whose lifetimes are computed to\nbe infinite are not considered below. In the following subsections\nwe present lifetime results for a series of molecules starting with\ndiatomics, ordered by the complexity of their electronic structure,\nand followed by the polyatomic molecules water and methane.\n\n\\subsection{SiO}\n\nThe ExoMol project has provided line lists for a number of closed\nshell diatomic species including NaCl and KCl \\cite{jt563}, PN \\cite{jt590},\nNaH \\cite{jt605}, CS \\cite{jt615} and CaO \\cite{jt618}. For NaH and\nCaO these studies also considered electronically excited state. Here\nwe consider SiO as an example. The silicon monoxide linelists of \\citeasnoun{jt563} are\nparticularly comprehensive, considering all vibrational  and rotational level up\nto the electronic ground state, corresponding to \n$v \\leq 98$ and $J \\leq 423$. They are  expected to be complete for\ntemperatures up to 9000 K and considered wavelenghts much shorter than\n1 $\\mu$m. We note that these very weak, short wavelength transitions\nare likely to be subject to numerical problems \\cite{15LiGoRo.CO,highv}\nwhich, however, are not expected to influence the results presented below.\nIn addition, SiO is a well-studied maser whose emissions have been\nobserved in a variety of sources and at several wavelengths\n\\cite{99Gray,04DeFuGl.SiO,08McHaxx.SiO,09CoChKi.SiO,10LiAnSh.SiO,10CoRaP3.SiO}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{SiO_energy_lifetime.eps}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of $^{28}$Si$^{16}$O.\nFrom the top\nthe curves are for vibrational state $v=0$, $v=1$ up to $v=27$. Curves\ncomprise states of increasing rotational quantum number, $J$, with energy.\nState with $J \\leq 61$ for $v=0$ are too long-lived to fit in the figure\nand are discussed in the text.}\n  \\label{f:SiO}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:SiO} gives lifetimes for vibration-rotation states of\n $^{28}$Si$^{16}$O. In general these lifetimes vary smoothly with vibrational\nstate, $v$, and rotational state, $J$, showing reduced lifetimes upon\nexcitation of either mode. States in the $v=0$ vibrational ground state\ncan only decay by a single, $\\Delta J =1$, transition. The rigid rotor\napproximation suggests that such decays should lead to lifetimes which\ndepend on $J^{-3}$\nand this behaviour is followed by our results. This means that the first\nexcited state with $J=1$ has a long lifetime, which we compute to be\n$3.32 \\times 10^5$ s.\n\nThe lifetimes of the vibrational-rotation states of other closed shell diatomic\nmolecules we studied behave in a similar fashion.\n\n\\subsection{CaH}\n\nExoMol has considered the vibration-rotation spectrum\nfor a number of molecules\nwhose electronic state also contains angular momentum \\cite{jt529}.\nIn this case it\nis necessary to consider a variety of couplings which are not present\nin a non-relativistic, Born-Oppenheimer treatment of the problem such\nas spin-orbit, spin-spin and spin-rotation coupling. Here we consider\ncalcium mononhydride, CaH, as an example.\n\nThe electronic ground state of calcuim monohydride has $^2\\Sigma^+$ symmetry. A line list\nfor it was computed by \\citeasnoun{jt529} with $v \\leq 19$ and $J \\leq 74$. \nWe note that an alternative\nline list, which also considered transitions to the first 5 electronic\nstates, has been provided by \\cite{03WeStKi.CaH}; this line list,\nwhich is purely {\\it ab initio}, did not consider fine structure and\nother coupling effects.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{CaH.eps}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of $^{40}$CaH.\nFrom the top\nthe ``curves'' are for vibrational state $v=0$, $v=1$ up to $v=5$.\nEach vibrational curves is actually a doublet with the generally\nlonger-lived component representing the $f$-states in red and\nthe shorter-lived $e$-states being given in black.}\n  \\label{f:CaH}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:CaH} summarises our results. The figure shows a number\nof features broadly in line with those seen for SiO above: for example\nlifetimes for the $v=0$ levels again showing a $J^{-3}$ behaviour. For\nhigher $J$ values there appears to be little dependence on spin component.\nHowever this is not true at low $J$ where it is found that the lifetimes\nfor the higher, $f$, component increase while those for the lower $e$ component\ndecrease significantly.\n\n\\subsection{AlO}\n\nAluminium monoxide is chosen not only because it is an important\nastronomical species having been observed in sunspots\n\\cite{13SrViSh.AlO} and a variety of other stars\n\\cite{13KaScMe.AlO,04BaAsLa.AlO,12BaVaMa.AlO} but also for terrestrial\napplications were emissions arise from rocket exhausts\n\\cite{96KnPiMu.AlO} and plasmas \\cite{14SuPa.AlO}. Furthermore there\nare direct experimental measurements of radiative lifetimes for\nvibrational levels in the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state\n\\cite{72JoCaBr.AlO,75DaCrZa.AlO}.\n\nThe ExoMol model for AlO considered the three lowest electronic states, all\nof which are spin doublets: X~$^2\\Sigma^+$, A~$^2\\Pi$ and  B~$^2\\Sigma^+$.\nIn practice the X and A states are close together and cross\nat energies under consideration leading to significant interaction between\nthe states which is explicitly allowed for in the model used \\cite{jt589}.\nLifetimes for AlO were computed using the linelist of \\citeasnoun{jt598}\nwhich considered $(v\\leq 66,J\\leq 300.5)$, $(v\\leq 63,J\\leq 300.5)$\nand $(v\\leq 40,J\\leq 232.5)$ for the X, A and B states respectively.\nThis linelist is designed to be valid for temperatures up to 8000 K and considered\nstates as high as 40~000 cm$^{-1}$. However above 30~000 cm$^{-1}$ the line list\ndoes not include all transitions meaning that for states in this region\nthe computed some lifetimes are artificially long; thus only states below 30~000 cm$^{-1}$ are considered.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{AlO_overview.eps}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n \\caption{Overview of lifetimes for states of\n $^{27}$Al$^{16}$O.}\n  \\label{f:AlO}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:AlO} gives an overview of lifetimes of levels\nbelonging to the lowest three electronic states of $^{27}$Al$^{16}$O.\nBroadly, the curves in the top left are associated with levels\nbelonging to the  X~$^2\\Sigma^+$ ground state, the large clump\nin the middle belong to the low-lying A~$^2\\Pi$ state and the\nshort lived levels at higher energy belong to the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state.\n\nSuperficially the structure of the  X~$^2\\Sigma^+$  state lifetimes\nare similar to those discussed above for SiO. However they differ in two\nkey aspects, firstly the states are much longer lived and secondly the shortest\nlived curve is for levels with $v=0$ and lifetimes actually increase with\nvibrational excitation. These features are due to the very flat dipole\nmoment curve of AlO which leads to unusually weak vibrational transitions\n\\cite{82LeLixx.AlO,jt598}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{AlO_A2PI_omega_comparison.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of\n  A~$^2\\Pi$ of AlO. }\n  \\label{f:AlOA}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe lifetimes of levels associated with the A~$^2\\Pi$ state vary by\nmany orders of magnitude. This is partly due to interaction with much\nlonger-lived levels from the X~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state via spin-orbit\ncoupling; the mixing of the wavefunctions between the two states leads\nto many structures in the lifetimes plot.  Furthermore the A~$^2\\Pi$\nstate itself is split into $\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\Omega =\n\\frac{3}{2}$ states by spin-orbit coupling. As shown in\nFig.~\\ref{f:AlOA}, the lifetimes of levels associated with these\ncurves are rather similar except when the levels interact with levels\nassociated with the X~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state.\n\n There available measurements of lifetimes for the $v=0$, 1 and 2\n levels of the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state: \\citeasnoun{72JoCaBr.AlO} obtained\n $128\\pm6$, $125\\pm5$ and $130\\pm7$ ns respectively for these levels\n while \\citeasnoun{75DaCrZa.AlO} obtained $100\\pm7$, $102\\pm7$ and\n $102\\pm4$ ns respectively. These measurements were both rotationally\n unresolved for unspecified rotational distributions.\n Figure~\\ref{f:AlOB} shows our rotationally resolved results for the\n lowest 10 vibrational states of the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state. It is clear\n that our calculations reproduce the trend of slowly increasing lifetime\n with vibrational state. The calculations also suggest that the\n lifetimes increase with rotational excitation making our results\n agree with those of \\citeasnoun{75DaCrZa.AlO} for $J$ in the region\n of 85 and those of \\citeasnoun{72JoCaBr.AlO} for somewhat higher\n values of $J$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{AlOBvJ.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of\n  B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ of AlO. From bottom to top\nthe curves are for vibrational state $v=0$, $v=1$ up to $v=9$. The small\nsplittings visible at higher $J$s is due to spin-rotation effects.}\n  \\label{f:AlOB}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{ScH}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:ScH} shows scandium monohydride lifetimes calculated\nusing the linelist of \\citeasnoun{jt599} which considered\nthe lowest six levels of ScH and $J\\leq 59$. In energy order these states are the\n X~$^1\\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state, a~$^3\\Delta$, b~$^3\\Pi$,\nA~$^1\\Delta$,  B~$^1\\Pi$,\nand  c~$^3\\Sigma^+$. The minima of these states span a range of\nlittle more than 6000 cm$^{-1}$. The many overlaps and couplings\nbetween these states causes a complicated set of patterns in the lifetime\nplot.\n\nIn contrast to the systems considered above, the model for ScH contains\nelectronic states with different spin symmetries. In particular, while\nthe ground state is a singlet, the first excited state is a triplet meaning\nthat there is no dipole connecting the two states. The a~$^3\\Delta$\nstate is therefore metastable and its levels have long lifetimes.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{ScH_State_comp_energy_lifetime.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes for states of\n $^{45}$ScH.}\n  \\label{f:ScH}\n\\end{figure}\n\nUnlike the other systems considered here, the line list computed\nby \\citeasnoun{jt599} for ScH is completely {\\it ab initio} since\nthere was insufficient available spectroscopic data to refine the\n{\\it ab initio} model. In addition, experience has shown that\npresent state-of-the-art\n{\\it ab initio} calculations give a much poorer starting point in\ntransition metal containing molecules. This means that our results\nfor ScH must be regarded as highly uncertain. Some experimentally\nmeasured lifetimes for this system would be very helpful as input to\nan improved model.\n\n\\subsection{Water}\n\nIn contrast to molecules like ScH and AlO, the intensity of key\nastrophysical transitions for a molecule like water are both well\nstudied and well-known \\cite{jt378,jt557}. However, as we show below,\nthe lifetimes of the various levels of water do not follow the simple\npatterns of, say, SiO discussed above. The lifetimes are important for\nmodels of the many water masers lines found both in ground\n\\cite{91NeMexx.maser} and excited \\cite{12HiKiHo.maser} vibrational\nstates as they can affect the pumping routes and level populations\nthat lead to inversions. Indeed the water maser is a textbook example\n\\cite{12Gray.maser}. Similar considerations apply to fluorescence from\ncomets \\cite{jt330,jt349}.\n\nHere we use the BT2 line list of \\citeasnoun{jt378} whose construction actually pre-dated\nthe ExoMol project. BT2 considered all states of water up to 30~000 cm$^{-1}$ with $J \\leq 50$\nand contains over 500 million transitions.\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:water} plots the lifetimes for levels lying below 5000\ncm$^{-1}$; ortho and para levels are denoted separately since these\nspecies effectively behave as separate molecules. While the general\nstructure of lifetimes is similar to that discussed for SiO, it is\nclear that the rotational substructure introduces additional\ncomplications. Indeed lifetimes for levels with the same total\nrotational quantum, $J$, within the vibrational ground state can\ndiffer by up to an order of magnitude.  While the shorter-lived\nlevels, which include the so-called water backbone \\cite{12Gray.maser}\nimportant for maser models, show some systematic structure in their\nlifetimes and similar values for ortho and para species, the variation\nbetween the lifetimes of the longer-lived levels is significant.  It\nis the details of this structure which allow masing to occur: for\nexample when the lifetime of the higher level is significantly longer\nrelative to the lower, the upper level can overpopulate relative to\nthe lower, critical for masing to occur.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{waterall.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of H$_2$$^{16}$O.}\n  \\label{f:water}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Methane}\n\nMethane is an important astronomical molecule and easily detected in\nhot environments \\cite{jt572}, but it does not possess a permanent dipole\nmoment hindering its detection in interstellar environments\n\\cite{91LaCaEv.CH4}. However, methane does possess a weak rotational\nspectrum \\cite{75CoHoxx.CH4,85OlAnBa.CH4,87HiLoCh.CH4,10BoPiRo.CH4} which is\nimportant for studies of methane in giant planets and Titan\n\\cite{07WiOrOz.CH4}.  Lifetimes were computed using the 10to10 line\nlist of \\citeasnoun{jt564} which contains almost 10 billion\nvibration-rotation transitions with $J \\leq 39$.\n\n\nThe high symmetry of CH$_4$ brings some unusual features to its\nspectroscopic behaviour.  Nuclear spin statistics divides the levels\ninto three distinct groups conventionally known as ortho, meta and\npara. One might expect that there would thus be 3 levels which do not\nundergo dipole-allowed radiative decay corresponding to the lowest\nlevel of each group. In fact, there are seven such levels. Labelling\nthem as $(J,n,$symmetry), where $n$ is simply a counting number,\nthey are the lowest ortho state (0,1,A$_1$)\nat 0 cm$^{-1}$, the lowest meta level (1,1,F$_1$) at 10.48 cm$^{-1}$,\nand the lowest para level (2,1,E) at 31.44 cm$^{-1}$, which are the\nlowest three levels in the molecule. In addition the three ortho\nstates (3,1,A$_2$) at 62.88 cm$^{-1}$, (6,1,A$_2$) at 219.92 cm$^{-1}$\nand (9,1,A$_1$) at 470.84 cm$^{-1}$ and the para state (4,1,E) at\n104.78 cm$^{-1}$ do not have any dipole allowed transitions linking\nthem to lower levels. These states will probably decay slowly by other\nmeans, such as via electric quadrupole transitions.\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:methane} gives lifetimes of vibration-rotation states of\nmethane lying below 4000 cm$^{-1}$. The very weak nature of methane's\nrotational spectrum means that states with no vibrational excitation\nlive for a long time and the figure actually spans 14 orders of\nmagnitude. In fact there are three very long-lived states which are\nomitted from the figure. These are (3,1,F$_2$) at 62.88 cm$^{-1}$,\n(6,1,A$_1$) at 219.95 cm$^{-1}$ and (12,1,A$_2$) at 817.10 cm$^{-1}$.\nNone of these states can undergo a dipole-allowed P ($\\Delta J =-1$)\ntransition and instead each decay via a single, very long-wavelength Q\n($\\Delta J =0$) transition. Our calculated lifetimes are $1 \\times\n10^{23}$, $4 \\times 10^{17}$, and $6 \\times 10^{13}$ s, respectively.\nThese are huge: in particular the lifetime of the (3,1,F$_2$) is\npredicted to be a thousand times the age of the Universe! Our precise\nnumbers are rather uncertain because the lifetime depends on the cube\nof the wavelength which, for close-by energy levels, is calculated\nwith a significant uncertainty. Furthermore, given the long lifetimes,\nit is likely that other non-dipole or two photon decays may become\ndominant. However, the prediction that these three states are very\nlong-lived in collision-free environments is likely to be correct.\nThe very faint, pure rotational spectrum of methane \nhas been studied by \\citeasnoun{10BoPiRo.CH4}, who were able to determine\nvalues for the very small dipoles linking the rotational states. It\nis the small values of these transition dipoles combined with the small gap between\nthe states involved that leads to the exceptionally long radiative lifetimes for\ncertain states.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{methaneomp.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of $^{12}$CH$_4$.}\n  \\label{f:methane}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Cooling functions}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{cooling.eps}\n \\caption{Temperature-dependent cooling functions for $^{40}$CaH, $^{28}$Si$^{16}$O, \n$^{27}$Al$^{16}$O and $^{45}$ScH.}\n  \\label{f:cool}\n\\end{figure}\n\nCooling functions were computed for the molecules discussed above\nusing the same line lists.  Results are given here graphically, see\nFig.~\\ref{f:cool} and \\ref{f:cool2}, and are given numerically in 1 K\nintervals on the ExoMol website. The cooling functions of AlO and ScH\nshow structure at lower temperatures due to the presence of\ntransitions from exited electronic states. The strong electronic\ntransitions also lead to the cooling functions for these two molecules \nbeing significantly stronger, especially of AlO at $\u00d0\u00a2>2000$~\u00d0\u009a.  The\ncooling function for water was computed up to $T$=3000~K, which is the\ntemperature limit of the BT2 linelist used \\cite{jt378} and that for\nmethane up to $T$=1500~K, the limit for the 10to10 list. Methane is\nactually a rather inefficient cooler below about 500~K which can be\nunderstood in terms of the long lifetimes of the rotationally excited\nstates discussed above.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{cooling_CH4_H2O.eps}\n \\caption{Temperature-dependent cooling functions for methane and water.}\n  \\label{f:cool2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIt should be noted that the cooling function of CaH is expected to underestimate at  $T>2000$~K) \ndue to the absence of the  excited electronic state in the ExoMol line list \\cite{jt529}.\n In general at high temperatures the cooling functions will be too low, due to the incompleteness \nof the underlying line lists. \nHowever it is possible to give an improved estimate, $W_{\\rm corr}(T)$,\nusing the partition function, if available:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 5489, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\nu_{if}$ is the wavenumber of the transition $i \\to f$,\n\n$J_i$ is the rotational quantum number of the initial state and $g_i$ is its nuclear\nspin degeneracy factor.

The ExoMol format has\nrecently been extended \\cite{jtexo} so that the states file can be \nused to capture information about each state in the molecule; this \nincludes its computed lifetime. Lifetime data for the molecules\nconsidered here can be found on the ExoMol website (www.exomol.com)\nand lifetime data for other molecules will be placed there as it\nbecomes available. In particular, the importance of lifetime cooling\neffects for H$_3^+$ were discussed in the introduction.  However,\ndespite there being an extensive H$_3^+$ linelist being available\n\\cite{jt181}, we have chosen not to present data for this system. For\ntechnical reasons the available linelist, despite its proven accuracy\n\\cite{jt512}, does not include the weak, ``forbidden'', far infrared\npure rotational transitions which govern both lifetime effects for\nstates in the vibrational ground state and the cooling function at low\ntemperatures. A new, more complete linelist for H$_3^+$ is currently\nbeing computed as part of the ExoMol project \\cite{jtH3+}. This new\nlinelist will be used to both calculate state-dependent \nlifetimes and a new cooling curve.\n\nLifetimes also provide an important link with laboratory experiments.\nMany astronomically important species and/or transitions can only be\nreproduced in the laboratory in non-equilibrium conditions.  This\nmakes it very difficult to measure transition intensities. The\nalternative approach of measuring lifetimes has the advantage that it\ndoes not depend on the level populations or thermaisation of the\nsample being studied. More of such measurements would be very helpful\nfor comparison and validation of our calculations.\n\n\n\nWe have shown that the presence of complex electronic spectra is\nresponsible for a non-monotonic behaviour of $W(T)$ at low\ntemperatures and strong cooling at high temperatures.  We will\ngenerate cooling functions routinely on the grid of 1~K and provide\nthem together with the partition functions as part of the ExoMol\ndatabase.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nThis work was supported by the ERC under the Advanced Investigator Project\n267219.\n\n\\section*{References}\n \\bibliographystyle{jphysicsB}\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{xx}\n\n\\harvarditem{Abel et~al.}{{2002}}{abel}\nAbel T, Bryan G~L \\harvardand\\ Norman M~L  {2002} {\\em Science} {\\bf\n  295},~93--98.\n\n\\harvarditem{Banerjee et~al.}{{2004}}{04BaAsLa.AlO}\nBanerjee D~P~K, Ashok N~M, Launila O, Davis C~J \\harvardand\\ Varricatt W~P\n  {2004} {\\em Astrophys.

Wavefunctions\nare obtained using variational nuclear motion codes \\cite{jt338,lr07,07YuThJe.method,jt588,jt609}.\nConversely dipole moment curves and surfaces are obtained  {\\it ab initio}:\nexperience has shown that, at least for molecules containing light\natoms, these are capable of giving results as accurate as the best\nmeasurements \\cite{jt509,jt613}.\n\n\\section{Results: lifetimes}\n\nLifetimes were obtained for molecules treated by the ExoMol project\n\\cite{jt578}. Examples are analysed below with complete sets of data\nbeing placed on the ExoMol website (www.exomol.com). While the ExoMol\nline lists are very extensive, with a few exceptions\n\\cite{jt347,jtpoz}, they are not complete.  Instead the project aims\nto provide comprehensive line lists which are effectively complete for a given\nupper temperature and range of wavelengths. These choices vary with\nthe expected stability of a given species but typical objectives are the\nprovision of a\nline list which represents all absorbtion longwards of 1 $\\mu$m (at\nwavenumbers below 10~000 cm$^{-1}$) for temperatures up to 3000~K.\nIn general these parameter ranges are increased for diatomics species which may be\nstable in environments as hot as\nour Sun's photosphere (almost 6000 K) and for which absorptions at visible\nwavelengths are of importance. Conversely, for large molecules such\nas nitric acid (HNO$_3$) the range of temperatures considered\nis significantly reduced, to only 500 K in this case \\cite{jt614}. These\nchoices are partially influenced by practical considerations as calculations\non polyatomic systems become very  computationally expensive \\cite{jt564}.\nThese considerations influence the states for which lifetime data is\npresented below.\n\nBy definition the ground state of all systems considered has an infinite\nlifetime to radiative decay. Some excited states also do not have\nallowed radiative decay routes, for example where these are forbidden\nby nuclear spin considerations. In principle, radiative nuclear spin\ntransitions which interchange ortho and para nuclear spin isomers can\noccur but they are extremely weak \\cite{jt329} and such\ntransitions are not considered\nas part  of ExoMol. States whose lifetimes are computed to\nbe infinite are not considered below. In the following subsections\nwe present lifetime results for a series of molecules starting with\ndiatomics, ordered by the complexity of their electronic structure,\nand followed by the polyatomic molecules water and methane.\n\n\\subsection{SiO}\n\nThe ExoMol project has provided line lists for a number of closed\nshell diatomic species including NaCl and KCl \\cite{jt563}, PN \\cite{jt590},\nNaH \\cite{jt605}, CS \\cite{jt615} and CaO \\cite{jt618}. For NaH and\nCaO these studies also considered electronically excited state. Here\nwe consider SiO as an example. The silicon monoxide linelists of \\citeasnoun{jt563} are\nparticularly comprehensive, considering all vibrational  and rotational level up\nto the electronic ground state, corresponding to \n$v \\leq 98$ and $J \\leq 423$. They are  expected to be complete for\ntemperatures up to 9000 K and considered wavelenghts much shorter than\n1 $\\mu$m. We note that these very weak, short wavelength transitions\nare likely to be subject to numerical problems \\cite{15LiGoRo.CO,highv}\nwhich, however, are not expected to influence the results presented below.\nIn addition, SiO is a well-studied maser whose emissions have been\nobserved in a variety of sources and at several wavelengths\n\\cite{99Gray,04DeFuGl.SiO,08McHaxx.SiO,09CoChKi.SiO,10LiAnSh.SiO,10CoRaP3.SiO}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{SiO_energy_lifetime.eps}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of $^{28}$Si$^{16}$O.\nFrom the top\nthe curves are for vibrational state $v=0$, $v=1$ up to $v=27$. Curves\ncomprise states of increasing rotational quantum number, $J$, with energy.\nState with $J \\leq 61$ for $v=0$ are too long-lived to fit in the figure\nand are discussed in the text.}\n  \\label{f:SiO}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:SiO} gives lifetimes for vibration-rotation states of\n $^{28}$Si$^{16}$O. In general these lifetimes vary smoothly with vibrational\nstate, $v$, and rotational state, $J$, showing reduced lifetimes upon\nexcitation of either mode. States in the $v=0$ vibrational ground state\ncan only decay by a single, $\\Delta J =1$, transition. The rigid rotor\napproximation suggests that such decays should lead to lifetimes which\ndepend on $J^{-3}$\nand this behaviour is followed by our results. This means that the first\nexcited state with $J=1$ has a long lifetime, which we compute to be\n$3.32 \\times 10^5$ s.\n\nThe lifetimes of the vibrational-rotation states of other closed shell diatomic\nmolecules we studied behave in a similar fashion.\n\n\\subsection{CaH}\n\nExoMol has considered the vibration-rotation spectrum\nfor a number of molecules\nwhose electronic state also contains angular momentum \\cite{jt529}.\nIn this case it\nis necessary to consider a variety of couplings which are not present\nin a non-relativistic, Born-Oppenheimer treatment of the problem such\nas spin-orbit, spin-spin and spin-rotation coupling. Here we consider\ncalcium mononhydride, CaH, as an example.\n\nThe electronic ground state of calcuim monohydride has $^2\\Sigma^+$ symmetry. A line list\nfor it was computed by \\citeasnoun{jt529} with $v \\leq 19$ and $J \\leq 74$. \nWe note that an alternative\nline list, which also considered transitions to the first 5 electronic\nstates, has been provided by \\cite{03WeStKi.CaH}; this line list,\nwhich is purely {\\it ab initio}, did not consider fine structure and\nother coupling effects.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{CaH.eps}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of $^{40}$CaH.\nFrom the top\nthe ``curves'' are for vibrational state $v=0$, $v=1$ up to $v=5$.\nEach vibrational curves is actually a doublet with the generally\nlonger-lived component representing the $f$-states in red and\nthe shorter-lived $e$-states being given in black.}\n  \\label{f:CaH}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:CaH} summarises our results. The figure shows a number\nof features broadly in line with those seen for SiO above: for example\nlifetimes for the $v=0$ levels again showing a $J^{-3}$ behaviour. For\nhigher $J$ values there appears to be little dependence on spin component.\nHowever this is not true at low $J$ where it is found that the lifetimes\nfor the higher, $f$, component increase while those for the lower $e$ component\ndecrease significantly.\n\n\\subsection{AlO}\n\nAluminium monoxide is chosen not only because it is an important\nastronomical species having been observed in sunspots\n\\cite{13SrViSh.AlO} and a variety of other stars\n\\cite{13KaScMe.AlO,04BaAsLa.AlO,12BaVaMa.AlO} but also for terrestrial\napplications were emissions arise from rocket exhausts\n\\cite{96KnPiMu.AlO} and plasmas \\cite{14SuPa.AlO}. Furthermore there\nare direct experimental measurements of radiative lifetimes for\nvibrational levels in the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state\n\\cite{72JoCaBr.AlO,75DaCrZa.AlO}.\n\nThe ExoMol model for AlO considered the three lowest electronic states, all\nof which are spin doublets: X~$^2\\Sigma^+$, A~$^2\\Pi$ and  B~$^2\\Sigma^+$.\nIn practice the X and A states are close together and cross\nat energies under consideration leading to significant interaction between\nthe states which is explicitly allowed for in the model used \\cite{jt589}.\nLifetimes for AlO were computed using the linelist of \\citeasnoun{jt598}\nwhich considered $(v\\leq 66,J\\leq 300.5)$, $(v\\leq 63,J\\leq 300.5)$\nand $(v\\leq 40,J\\leq 232.5)$ for the X, A and B states respectively.\nThis linelist is designed to be valid for temperatures up to 8000 K and considered\nstates as high as 40~000 cm$^{-1}$. However above 30~000 cm$^{-1}$ the line list\ndoes not include all transitions meaning that for states in this region\nthe computed some lifetimes are artificially long; thus only states below 30~000 cm$^{-1}$ are considered.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{AlO_overview.eps}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n \\caption{Overview of lifetimes for states of\n $^{27}$Al$^{16}$O.}\n  \\label{f:AlO}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:AlO} gives an overview of lifetimes of levels\nbelonging to the lowest three electronic states of $^{27}$Al$^{16}$O.\nBroadly, the curves in the top left are associated with levels\nbelonging to the  X~$^2\\Sigma^+$ ground state, the large clump\nin the middle belong to the low-lying A~$^2\\Pi$ state and the\nshort lived levels at higher energy belong to the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state.\n\nSuperficially the structure of the  X~$^2\\Sigma^+$  state lifetimes\nare similar to those discussed above for SiO. However they differ in two\nkey aspects, firstly the states are much longer lived and secondly the shortest\nlived curve is for levels with $v=0$ and lifetimes actually increase with\nvibrational excitation. These features are due to the very flat dipole\nmoment curve of AlO which leads to unusually weak vibrational transitions\n\\cite{82LeLixx.AlO,jt598}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{AlO_A2PI_omega_comparison.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of\n  A~$^2\\Pi$ of AlO. }\n  \\label{f:AlOA}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe lifetimes of levels associated with the A~$^2\\Pi$ state vary by\nmany orders of magnitude. This is partly due to interaction with much\nlonger-lived levels from the X~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state via spin-orbit\ncoupling; the mixing of the wavefunctions between the two states leads\nto many structures in the lifetimes plot.  Furthermore the A~$^2\\Pi$\nstate itself is split into $\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\Omega =\n\\frac{3}{2}$ states by spin-orbit coupling. As shown in\nFig.~\\ref{f:AlOA}, the lifetimes of levels associated with these\ncurves are rather similar except when the levels interact with levels\nassociated with the X~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state.\n\n There available measurements of lifetimes for the $v=0$, 1 and 2\n levels of the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state: \\citeasnoun{72JoCaBr.AlO} obtained\n $128\\pm6$, $125\\pm5$ and $130\\pm7$ ns respectively for these levels\n while \\citeasnoun{75DaCrZa.AlO} obtained $100\\pm7$, $102\\pm7$ and\n $102\\pm4$ ns respectively. These measurements were both rotationally\n unresolved for unspecified rotational distributions.\n Figure~\\ref{f:AlOB} shows our rotationally resolved results for the\n lowest 10 vibrational states of the B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ state. It is clear\n that our calculations reproduce the trend of slowly increasing lifetime\n with vibrational state. The calculations also suggest that the\n lifetimes increase with rotational excitation making our results\n agree with those of \\citeasnoun{75DaCrZa.AlO} for $J$ in the region\n of 85 and those of \\citeasnoun{72JoCaBr.AlO} for somewhat higher\n values of $J$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{AlOBvJ.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of\n  B~$^2\\Sigma^+$ of AlO. From bottom to top\nthe curves are for vibrational state $v=0$, $v=1$ up to $v=9$. The small\nsplittings visible at higher $J$s is due to spin-rotation effects.}\n  \\label{f:AlOB}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{ScH}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:ScH} shows scandium monohydride lifetimes calculated\nusing the linelist of \\citeasnoun{jt599} which considered\nthe lowest six levels of ScH and $J\\leq 59$. In energy order these states are the\n X~$^1\\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state, a~$^3\\Delta$, b~$^3\\Pi$,\nA~$^1\\Delta$,  B~$^1\\Pi$,\nand  c~$^3\\Sigma^+$. The minima of these states span a range of\nlittle more than 6000 cm$^{-1}$. The many overlaps and couplings\nbetween these states causes a complicated set of patterns in the lifetime\nplot.\n\nIn contrast to the systems considered above, the model for ScH contains\nelectronic states with different spin symmetries. In particular, while\nthe ground state is a singlet, the first excited state is a triplet meaning\nthat there is no dipole connecting the two states. The a~$^3\\Delta$\nstate is therefore metastable and its levels have long lifetimes.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{ScH_State_comp_energy_lifetime.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes for states of\n $^{45}$ScH.}\n  \\label{f:ScH}\n\\end{figure}\n\nUnlike the other systems considered here, the line list computed\nby \\citeasnoun{jt599} for ScH is completely {\\it ab initio} since\nthere was insufficient available spectroscopic data to refine the\n{\\it ab initio} model. In addition, experience has shown that\npresent state-of-the-art\n{\\it ab initio} calculations give a much poorer starting point in\ntransition metal containing molecules. This means that our results\nfor ScH must be regarded as highly uncertain. Some experimentally\nmeasured lifetimes for this system would be very helpful as input to\nan improved model.\n\n\\subsection{Water}\n\nIn contrast to molecules like ScH and AlO, the intensity of key\nastrophysical transitions for a molecule like water are both well\nstudied and well-known \\cite{jt378,jt557}. However, as we show below,\nthe lifetimes of the various levels of water do not follow the simple\npatterns of, say, SiO discussed above. The lifetimes are important for\nmodels of the many water masers lines found both in ground\n\\cite{91NeMexx.maser} and excited \\cite{12HiKiHo.maser} vibrational\nstates as they can affect the pumping routes and level populations\nthat lead to inversions. Indeed the water maser is a textbook example\n\\cite{12Gray.maser}. Similar considerations apply to fluorescence from\ncomets \\cite{jt330,jt349}.\n\nHere we use the BT2 line list of \\citeasnoun{jt378} whose construction actually pre-dated\nthe ExoMol project. BT2 considered all states of water up to 30~000 cm$^{-1}$ with $J \\leq 50$\nand contains over 500 million transitions.\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:water} plots the lifetimes for levels lying below 5000\ncm$^{-1}$; ortho and para levels are denoted separately since these\nspecies effectively behave as separate molecules. While the general\nstructure of lifetimes is similar to that discussed for SiO, it is\nclear that the rotational substructure introduces additional\ncomplications. Indeed lifetimes for levels with the same total\nrotational quantum, $J$, within the vibrational ground state can\ndiffer by up to an order of magnitude.  While the shorter-lived\nlevels, which include the so-called water backbone \\cite{12Gray.maser}\nimportant for maser models, show some systematic structure in their\nlifetimes and similar values for ortho and para species, the variation\nbetween the lifetimes of the longer-lived levels is significant.  It\nis the details of this structure which allow masing to occur: for\nexample when the lifetime of the higher level is significantly longer\nrelative to the lower, the upper level can overpopulate relative to\nthe lower, critical for masing to occur.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{waterall.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of H$_2$$^{16}$O.}\n  \\label{f:water}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Methane}\n\nMethane is an important astronomical molecule and easily detected in\nhot environments \\cite{jt572}, but it does not possess a permanent dipole\nmoment hindering its detection in interstellar environments\n\\cite{91LaCaEv.CH4}. However, methane does possess a weak rotational\nspectrum \\cite{75CoHoxx.CH4,85OlAnBa.CH4,87HiLoCh.CH4,10BoPiRo.CH4} which is\nimportant for studies of methane in giant planets and Titan\n\\cite{07WiOrOz.CH4}.  Lifetimes were computed using the 10to10 line\nlist of \\citeasnoun{jt564} which contains almost 10 billion\nvibration-rotation transitions with $J \\leq 39$.\n\n\nThe high symmetry of CH$_4$ brings some unusual features to its\nspectroscopic behaviour.  Nuclear spin statistics divides the levels\ninto three distinct groups conventionally known as ortho, meta and\npara. One might expect that there would thus be 3 levels which do not\nundergo dipole-allowed radiative decay corresponding to the lowest\nlevel of each group. In fact, there are seven such levels. Labelling\nthem as $(J,n,$symmetry), where $n$ is simply a counting number,\nthey are the lowest ortho state (0,1,A$_1$)\nat 0 cm$^{-1}$, the lowest meta level (1,1,F$_1$) at 10.48 cm$^{-1}$,\nand the lowest para level (2,1,E) at 31.44 cm$^{-1}$, which are the\nlowest three levels in the molecule. In addition the three ortho\nstates (3,1,A$_2$) at 62.88 cm$^{-1}$, (6,1,A$_2$) at 219.92 cm$^{-1}$\nand (9,1,A$_1$) at 470.84 cm$^{-1}$ and the para state (4,1,E) at\n104.78 cm$^{-1}$ do not have any dipole allowed transitions linking\nthem to lower levels. These states will probably decay slowly by other\nmeans, such as via electric quadrupole transitions.\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:methane} gives lifetimes of vibration-rotation states of\nmethane lying below 4000 cm$^{-1}$. The very weak nature of methane's\nrotational spectrum means that states with no vibrational excitation\nlive for a long time and the figure actually spans 14 orders of\nmagnitude. In fact there are three very long-lived states which are\nomitted from the figure. These are (3,1,F$_2$) at 62.88 cm$^{-1}$,\n(6,1,A$_1$) at 219.95 cm$^{-1}$ and (12,1,A$_2$) at 817.10 cm$^{-1}$.\nNone of these states can undergo a dipole-allowed P ($\\Delta J =-1$)\ntransition and instead each decay via a single, very long-wavelength Q\n($\\Delta J =0$) transition. Our calculated lifetimes are $1 \\times\n10^{23}$, $4 \\times 10^{17}$, and $6 \\times 10^{13}$ s, respectively.\nThese are huge: in particular the lifetime of the (3,1,F$_2$) is\npredicted to be a thousand times the age of the Universe! Our precise\nnumbers are rather uncertain because the lifetime depends on the cube\nof the wavelength which, for close-by energy levels, is calculated\nwith a significant uncertainty. Furthermore, given the long lifetimes,\nit is likely that other non-dipole or two photon decays may become\ndominant. However, the prediction that these three states are very\nlong-lived in collision-free environments is likely to be correct.\nThe very faint, pure rotational spectrum of methane \nhas been studied by \\citeasnoun{10BoPiRo.CH4}, who were able to determine\nvalues for the very small dipoles linking the rotational states. It\nis the small values of these transition dipoles combined with the small gap between\nthe states involved that leads to the exceptionally long radiative lifetimes for\ncertain states.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{methaneomp.eps}\n\\vspace{1cm}\n \\caption{Lifetimes of the vibration-rotation states of $^{12}$CH$_4$.}\n  \\label{f:methane}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Cooling functions}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{cooling.eps}\n \\caption{Temperature-dependent cooling functions for $^{40}$CaH, $^{28}$Si$^{16}$O, \n$^{27}$Al$^{16}$O and $^{45}$ScH.}\n  \\label{f:cool}\n\\end{figure}\n\nCooling functions were computed for the molecules discussed above\nusing the same line lists.  Results are given here graphically, see\nFig.~\\ref{f:cool} and \\ref{f:cool2}, and are given numerically in 1 K\nintervals on the ExoMol website. The cooling functions of AlO and ScH\nshow structure at lower temperatures due to the presence of\ntransitions from exited electronic states. The strong electronic\ntransitions also lead to the cooling functions for these two molecules \nbeing significantly stronger, especially of AlO at $\u00d0\u00a2>2000$~\u00d0\u009a.  The\ncooling function for water was computed up to $T$=3000~K, which is the\ntemperature limit of the BT2 linelist used \\cite{jt378} and that for\nmethane up to $T$=1500~K, the limit for the 10to10 list. Methane is\nactually a rather inefficient cooler below about 500~K which can be\nunderstood in terms of the long lifetimes of the rotationally excited\nstates discussed above.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{cooling_CH4_H2O.eps}\n \\caption{Temperature-dependent cooling functions for methane and water.}\n  \\label{f:cool2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIt should be noted that the cooling function of CaH is expected to underestimate at  $T>2000$~K) \ndue to the absence of the  excited electronic state in the ExoMol line list \\cite{jt529}.\n In general at high temperatures the cooling functions will be too low, due to the incompleteness \nof the underlying line lists. \nHowever it is possible to give an improved estimate, $W_{\\rm corr}(T)$,\nusing the partition function, if available:\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n W_{\\rm corr}(T) = W(T) \\frac{Q(T)}{Q_{\\rm LL}(T)}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"W_{\\rm corr}(T)=W(T)\\frac{Q(T)}{Q_{\\rm LL}(T)}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>corr</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>W</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>LL</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
