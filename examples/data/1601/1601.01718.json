Since, as will\nbe seen in Section \\ref{sec:Discussion}, the realization of superradiance\nsmall-sample is unlikely to take place in the CSEs of evolved stars\nfor the collisional time-scales previously calculated (see Paper I),\nwe focus our analysis on the case of a large-sample.\n\nTaking into account the dephasing/relaxation effects, the behavior\nof a superradiant system can be expressed by a set of so-called Maxwell-Bloch\nequations within the framework of the slowly varying envelope approximation\n(SVEA) \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}}{\\partial\\tau} & = & \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left(\\hat{P}_{0}^{+}\\hat{E}_{0}^{+}-\\hat{E}_{0}^{-}\\hat{P}_{0}^{-}\\right)-\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}}{T_{1}}\\label{eq:N-tau-dephase}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\hat{P}_{0}^{+}}{\\partial\\tau} & = & \\frac{2id^{2}}{\\hbar}\\hat{E}_{0}^{-}\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}-\\frac{\\hat{P}_{0}^{+}}{T_{2}}\\label{eq:P+-tau-dephase}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\hat{E}_{0}^{+}}{\\partial z} & = & \\frac{i\\omega}{2\\epsilon_{0}c}\\hat{P}_{0}^{-},\\label{eq:E-z-dephase}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $T_{1}$ is the (phenomenological) time-scale of non-coherent\npopulation relaxation (e.g., through inelastic collisions) and similarly\n$T_{2}$ for phase relaxation (e.g., through elastic collisions).\nThese equations were derived within the context of Heisenberg representation.\nThe quantities $\\hat{P}_{0}^{\\pm}$ and $\\hat{E}_{0}^{\\pm}$ are the\nenvelopes for the polarization $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}^{\\pm}$ and the electric\nfield $\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}^{\\pm}$ vectors, respectively, which are assumed\nto have the following form\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right) & = & \\hat{P}_{0}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right)e^{\\pm i\\omega\\tau}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\mathrm{m}}\\label{eq:P-wave}\\\\\n\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right) & = & \\hat{E}_{0}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right)e^{\\mp i\\omega\\tau}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\mathrm{m}},\\label{eq:E-wave}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ the unit vector indicating\nthe orientation of the molecular electric dipole moment. The population\ninversion density is given by (twice) $\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}$, while $d$\nand $\\omega$ are, respectively, the transition dipole matrix element\nand the radiation field's frequency at resonance with the molecular\ntransition. Equations (\\ref{eq:N-tau-dephase}) to (\\ref{eq:E-z-dephase})\nare derived using a two-level system model and describe the evolution\nof the matter-field system in the retarded-time frame $\\tau$ ($=t-z/c$\n, where $c$ is the speed of light). In the ISM, an OH sample interacting\nwith the radiation along the line-of-sight can be modeled by a cylindrical\nlarge-sample along the $z$-axis. Although a one-dimensional field\nequation discards the loss of radiation due to diffraction or transverse\neffects, it is an approximation that reduces the number of variables\nand allows us to move the analysis forward while retaining the essential\nphysics of the problem. Nonetheless, considerations of the sample's\ngeometry, described by the Fresnel number $F=A/\\left(\\lambda L\\right)$,\nwith $A$ and $L$ the cross-section and length of the sample, respectively,\nwill also enter our analysis.\n\nUnder the assumption that the different dephasing time-scales are\nsimilar (i.e., $T^{\\prime}\\equiv T_{1}=T_{2}$), the Maxwell-Bloch\nequations can be solved by effecting the following change of variables \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{\\mathbb{N}} & = & \\frac{N}{2V}\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)e^{-\\tau/T^{\\prime}}\\label{eq:N_dephase}\\\\\n\\hat{P}_{0}^{+} & = & \\frac{Nd}{2V}\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)e^{-\\tau/T^{\\prime}},\\label{eq:P_+_dephase}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\\noindent where $\\theta$ is the so-called Bloch angle and $N$ is\nthe number of inverted molecules at $\\tau=0$ in the sample volume\n$V$.

As the detection\nof 1612 MHz OH masers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars\nimplies the existence of a population inversion and a high level of\nvelocity coherence, and that these are two necessary requirements\nfor superradiance, we investigate whether superradiance can also happen\nin these regions. Superradiance is characterized by high intensity,\nspatially compact, burst-like features taking place over time-scales\non the order of seconds to years, depending on the size and physical\nconditions present in the regions harboring such sources of radiation.\nOur analysis suggests that superradiance provides a valid explanation\nfor previous observations of intensity flares detected in that spectral\nline for the U Orionis Mira star and the IRAS18276-1431 pre-planetary\nnebula. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{molecular processes -- ISM: molecules -- radiation mechanisms: general }\n\n\n\\section{Introduction\\label{sec:Introduction}}\n\nThe OH (hydroxyl) rotational transitions at nearly 18 cm were the\nfirst interstellar lines detected in the radio range \\citep{Weinreb1963}.\nThe ground level of that molecule is split into two sub-levels known\nas $\\Lambda$-doublets with $\\pm\\Lambda\\hbar$ energies. Each component\nof the $\\Lambda$-doublets is also split into two hyperfine levels\nlabelled $F=1$ and $F=2$, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:OH-level diagram}.\nThe transitions that connect sub-levels with the same $F$-values\nare called the\\textit{ main lines}, whereas the transitions between\nsub-levels of different $F$-value are called the \\emph{satellite\nlines} \\citep{Stahler2008}. The four transitions including the two\nmain lines at 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz and the two satellite lines at\n1612 MHz and 1720 MHz compose the group of 18 cm wavelength lines.\nIn optically thin regions under conditions of local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE), the expected intensity ratios are approximately\n1:5:9:1 for the 1612 MHz, 1665 MHz, 1667 MHz and 1720 MHz lines, respectively\n\\citep{Elitzur2012,Basu2003}. However, in several observations different\nline ratios were measured \\citep{McGee1965}, and in some cases the\nintensity of a given line significantly exceeded that predicted using\nLTE \\citep{Weaver1965}. The strong anomalous line intensities were\nexplained by postulating maser action for the corresponding transitions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\epsscale{0.7}\\plotone{f1.eps}\n\n\\caption{\\label{fig:OH-level diagram}The schematic diagram of the ground rotational\nstate of the OH molecule.

In the\npresence of a pumping mechanism that can maintain a higher population\nin the excited level, the corresponding transition can exhibit the\nexceptionally high intensity typical of maser sources \\citep{Elitzur2012}.\nThe aforementioned study of \\citet{Weaver1965} reported the first\ndetection of an OH maser, which was to be followed by several other\ndetections in different regions of the interstellar medium (ISM).\nA few years later \\citet{Turner1970} suggested to arrange OH maser\nsources into two classes: Type {\\footnotesize I} and Type {\\footnotesize II},\ndepending on their brightest detected line. In Type {\\footnotesize I},\nthe main-line transitions, especially the one at 1665 MHz, are dominant.\nThe sources in this class are usually detected in star-forming sites\nnearby H {\\footnotesize II} regions. Type {\\footnotesize II} sources\nare further divided into Type {\\footnotesize IIa} and Type {\\footnotesize IIb}\nin which the brightest line corresponds to one of the satellite lines.\nType {\\footnotesize IIa} OH maser sources, which are usually detected\nin supernova remnants, are brightest at 1720 MHz, while in Type {\\footnotesize IIb}\nthe 1612 MHz line is dominant. These sources are often spatially associated\nwith highly evolved stars undergoing rapid mass loss and enclosed\nin a circumstellar shell \\citep{Gray2012}. In addition, the first\nextragalactic OH maser was detected in 1982 by \\citet{Baan1982} in\nArp 220 (IC 4553) with a luminosity approximately $10^{8}$ times\ngreater than that of typical galactic OH masers. This led to the term\n``megamaser.'' Since then several OH megamasers, and even gigamasers,\nhave been detected \\citep{Darling2002}, usually in the nuclear region\nof luminous or ultra-luminous infrared galaxies \\citep{Lockett2008}.\n\nThe existence of 18-cm OH masers confirms the possibility of inverting\npopulations in the ground level $\\Lambda$-doublets of this molecule\nin the ISM. Different pumping mechanisms are suggested for different\ntypes of galactic and extragalactic masers. For instance, Type {\\footnotesize IIb}\nmaser sources nearby evolved stars are known to be pumped by the far-infrared\nradiation emitted from dust (\\citealt{Elitzur2012, He2005}; see Section\n\\ref{sec:Requirements-of-Superradiance} for more details), while\nit is suggested that the pumping of OH Type {\\footnotesize I} main-line\nmasers is controlled by collisions with $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules\nin star-forming regions\\textcolor{blue}{{} }\\citep{Kylafis1990}. Maser\naction also requires line-of-sight velocity coherence, which can lead\nto an abnormally narrow line-width through amplification along the\nradiation path. This also implies that, to a good approximation, the\nDoppler broadening effect can be neglected for molecules involved\nin the masing process.\n\nPopulation inversion and velocity coherence are also required for\nthe superradiance cooperative radiation process. In 1954, R. H. Dicke\npointed out that a sample consisting of $N$ excited atoms/molecules\ninteracting with a common radiation field cannot always be considered\nas a collection of independent radiators \\citep{Dicke1954}. He showed\nthat, under ideal conditions and after a time delay, the sample of\natoms/molecules can radiate its stored energy at an enhanced rate\n$N\\Gamma$; $N$ times faster than the spontaneous emission rate $\\Gamma$\nof a single atom/molecule. As a result, the intensity of the output\nradiation $I_{\\mathrm{SR}}$ scales as the square of the number of\ninverted atoms/molecules $N$, unlike the linear dependency of the\nradiation intensity from the corresponding non-coherent system $I_{\\mathrm{nc}}$\n(\\citealt{Rajabi2016}; hereafter Paper I).\n\nIn the ISM, it is usually assumed that atoms/molecules interact with\nthe radiation field independently and the intensity of the radiation\nbecomes a linear function of the atomic/molecular density (if the\nline is optically thin). But in the case of OH 18-cm line, for which\nthe detection of several maser sources verifies the possibility of\nachieving population inversion and velocity coherence in some regions,\nthis assumption may fail and it becomes important to examine the possibility\nof superradiance and coherent interactions. Accordingly, in this paper\nwe follow on the superradiance analysis performed in Paper I for the\nH{\\footnotesize I} 21 cm (magnetic dipole) transition with a similar\nstudy for the OH 18 cm (electric dipole) line. In order to do so,\nwe first discuss the necessary conditions for superradiance in Section\n\\ref{sec:Requirements-of-Superradiance}, and narrow down our focus\nto the 1612 MHz line interacting with OH molecules in the outer regions\nof the circumstellar envelope of highly evolved stars. In Section\n\\ref{sec:Theory}, we investigate the likelihood that these conditions\ncan be met in these regions using the Heisenberg approach, with a\nmethod of analysis that is an electric dipolar version of the magnetic\ndipole study found in Paper I and is similar to earlier analyses found\nin the physics literature \\citep{Gross1982, Benedict1996}. In Section\n\\ref{sec:Discussion} we discuss our numerical results on the characteristics\nof a potential OH 1612 MHz coherent system, with an application to\nprevious observations performed on the U Orionis Mira star \\citep{Jewell1981}\nand the IRAS18276-1431 pre-planetary nebula \\citep{Wolak2014}. We\nend with a short conclusion in Section \\ref{sec:Conclusion}.\n\n\n\\section{Requirements for Superradiance\\label{sec:Requirements-of-Superradiance}}\n\nIn this section we provide a brief summary of the requirements needed\nfor superradiance, but a more detailed discussion will be found in\nSection 2 of Paper I. Our discussion applies equally well to atoms\nor molecules, however, we will focus on molecular superradiance since\nOH is the subject of our analysis.\n\nWhen a group of $N$ excited molecules are placed within a volume\n$V$ much smaller than $\\lambda^{3}$, the cube of the wavelength\nof the radiation $\\lambda$ interacting with the molecules, the radiation\nby one molecule is seen to be in phase by the other molecules. As\na result, the radiation from the different molecules interfere constructively\nand a strong directional pulse emerges from the sample \\citep{Dicke1954}.\nThis process can also be described from the molecular point of view.\nIn a small-sample (i.e., defined for $V\\ll\\lambda^{3}$) the intermolecular\ndistance $r$ is much smaller than $\\lambda$ and, for such small\nintermolecular distances, the interaction between the molecular dipoles\nand the radiation field is symmetrical throughout the sample. As a\nresult, after a delay time $t_{\\mathrm{D}}$ the molecular dipoles\nlock to a common phase and act like a single macroscopic dipole radiating\na superradiant intensity $I_{\\mathrm{SR}}=NI_{\\mathrm{nc}}$ \\citep{Dicke1954, Gross1982, Benedict1996}. \n\nThe phenomenon can be extended to a large-sample, defined as $N$\nmolecules distributed over a volume $V\\gg\\lambda^{3}$, with inter-molecular\nspacings potentially larger than $\\lambda$. In a large-sample, the\nphase of the radiation varies from place to place as a result of propagation.\nThis will lead to a non-uniform spatial evolution of the molecules,\nand can result in a weaker coherent behavior as compared to that of\na small-sample. However, the higher number of molecules partaking\nin coherent interactions in a large-sample can make up for this, resulting\nin an intense output superradiant pulse with $I_{\\mathrm{SR}}=NfI_{\\mathrm{nc}}$,\nwhere the $Nf$ factor determines the enhancement of the radiation\nintensity in comparison to $I_{\\mathrm{nc}}$ and the efficiency of\nthe common phase-locking process is reflected in $f\\left(<1\\right)$\nalone. Unlike for a small-sample, the phase-matching condition in\na large-sample can only be met in some particular directions, and\nthe fact that the phase-locking factor $f$ is always smaller than\nunity implies a weakened superradiance. It is found that after a delay\ntime $\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$, a first burst of superradiance emerges\nthe sample followed by a number of weaker bursts, the so-called ringing\neffect (see Section \\ref{sec:Theory} below, and Sections 3 and 4\nin Paper I). The ringing effect is associated with the re-absorption\nand re-emission of radiation through the end-fire of a large-sample\ninteracting with the incoming radiation originating from other parts\nin the sample.\n\nAny mechanism that non-coherently reduces the excited level population\n(e.g., collisional relaxation) or disturbs the phase-locking process\ncan diminish and even terminate superradiance. It is therefore necessary\nthat the time-scale of dephasing/relaxation effects be longer than\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$ in a large-sample (or $t_{\\mathrm{D}}$ in a\nsmall-sample) to allow for the development of any coherent behavior.\nThis also explains why velocity coherence is an essential condition\nfor superradiance. In the absence of velocity coherence, random thermal\nmotions in a gas results in Doppler line broadening that corresponds\nto a very short dephasing time-scale (i.e., $T_{\\mathrm{therm}}\\ll\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$),\nand renders this phenomenon the most likely cause of dephasing in\na sample. For this reason, it is not expected that superradiance could\narise in a thermally relaxed gas. Our study of superradiance is better\nsuited to regions of the ISM where thermal equilibrium has not been\nreached (e.g., shocks; see Paper I).\n\nFor any region in the ISM, inelastic collisions with ions, electrons,\nhydrogen atoms and molecules, or dust grains can further change the\ninternal state of an OH molecule, and if the associated time-scale\nis smaller than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$, coherent behavior and superradiance\ncan be suppressed. Although they do not change the internal state\nof a molecule, elastic collisions can also interrupt the coherent\nphase-locking process and weaken superradiance. This is because during\nan elastic collision the spacings between energy levels for the colliding\ncounterparts change as a result of short-range interaction forces.\nAfter a number of such collisions each acting like a random perturbation,\nthe molecule can lose coherence with the interacting radiation field\n\\citep{Wittke1956}. Elastic collisions are normally more frequent\nthan inelastic collisions, and the mean time between elastic collisions\nusually sets the time-scale of collisional dephasing/relaxation $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$\nand the corresponding condition $\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}<T_{\\mathrm{c}}$\nis required to allow the build-up of coherent interactions.\n\nThe above discussion also implies that coherent interactions cannot\nbe developed in a collisionally pumped OH sample since that would\nrequire that the pumping time-scale $T_{\\mathrm{P}}=T_{\\mathrm{c}}<\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$,\nwhich contradicts the necessary condition $T_{\\mathrm{c}}>\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$\nfor superradiance (see Paper I). Thus, for our present study of superradiance\nwe will only focus on OH samples that are believed to be inverted\nthrough radiative processes. The studies of pumping mechanism of OH\nmasers show that the 1612 MHz masers associated with evolved stars\nare pumped by far-infrared photons at 35 and 53 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n\\citep{Litvak1969, Jewell1979, Gray2012, Elitzur2012}. These photons\nare emitted from dust shells formed by mass losses of the central\nstar. The radiative pumping model for 1612 MHz masers nearby evolved\nstars is corroborated by the observation of correlated variations\nin the intensities of the star and corresponding masers \\citep{Harvey1974, Jewell1979}.\nWhile recent studies by \\citet{He2005} and \\citet{Lockett2008} suggest\nthat OH megamasers, which emit primarily at 1667 MHz and 1665 MHz,\nare also pumped by far-infrared radiation (more precisely 53 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\nradiation from dust), the determination of the exact pumping mechanism\nof main-line masers still requires more studies and collisional processes\nare not generally ruled out from the pumping scenarios \\citep{Gray2012}.\nHence, in this paper we limit our investigation to the possibility\nof superradiance for the 1612 MHz line interacting with OH molecules\nin the circumstellar envelopes of late-type stars.\n\n\n\\subsection{OH Samples Nearby Evolved Stars\\label{sub:OH-Samples-Nearby}}\n\nOne of the final stages in the evolution of a low- to intermediate-mass\nstar (i.e., stars with masses of about $1$ M$_{\\odot}$ to $8$ M$_{\\odot}$)\nis the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. In that stage, the star,\nwhich is composed of an oxygen/carbon core enclosed within layers\nof hydrogen and helium, becomes variable and ejects some of its mass\ninto the interstellar medium through shock waves. As shock waves move\nfurther from the star, they become cooler and denser forming a shell\naround the star known as the circumstellar envelope (CSE). The CSE\nof an evolved star can harbor masers of different types depending\non its composition. OH masers are usually found in the CSE of oxygen-rich\n(or M-type) stars. Examples of such stars are Mira variables, long-period\nM-type stars with periods of 100-500 days \\citep{Karttunen2007},\nwhich are known source of 1612 MHz OH maser emission. OH-IR stars\nare another group of long-period variables that were originally detected\nthrough their 1612 MHz OH maser emission and the infrared radiation\nemanating from their CSE. Miras are variable at both visible and infrared\nwavelengths, whereas the CSE of OH-IR stars absorbs starlight at visible\nwavelengths and re-emits it in the infrared. OH-IR stars are thought\nto lose mass at a rate of $10^{-8}$ M$_{\\varodot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to\n$10^{-4}$ M$_{\\varodot}$ yr$^{-1}$ forming larger CSEs than Miras,\nwhich have a lower mass-loss rate. The CSEs of these evolved stars\nare theoretically divided into three zones \\citep{Gray1999}, of which\nthe inner and outer zones are relevant to our study. In the outermost\nzone, where the CSE is optically thin, UV light from the interstellar\nmedium dissociates $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ molecules into OH. In the inner\nzones, the radiation from the central star is absorbed by dust grains\nand is re-emitted in the infrared. It was initially suggested by \\citet{Elitzur1976}\nthat the 35- and 53-$\\mathrm{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$ infrared photons emitted\nfrom dust pump the 1612 MHz OH masers in the outer regions of the\nCSE of evolved stars. The pumping scheme proposed by \\citet{Elitzur1976}\nwas modified by \\citet{Gray2005}, and their detailed analysis of\ncollisional and radiative couplings of OH molecules in the expanding\nCSE of OH-IR stars indicated that the strongest pumping route uses\n53-$\\mathrm{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$ photons.\n\nThe CSE of evolved stars expands radially and reaches a constant terminal\nvelocity $v_{\\infty}\\sim10$ km $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $20$ km $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nin its outer regions \\citep{Gray2012}. At distances about $r\\gtrsim10^{16}$\ncm from the central star velocity coherence is achieved among OH molecules\nmoving with the well-defined terminal velocity in the radial or tangential\ndirections relative to the OH shell \\citep{Draine2011}. This allows\nthe definition of cylindrical OH samples in which Doppler broadening\neffects are negligible and the inversion is achieved by the infrared\npumping from warm dust. In such a sample coherent correlations may\ndevelop among OH molecules if the shortest non-coherent relaxation/dephasing\ntime-scale is larger than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$ for a large-sample\nor $t_{\\mathrm{D}}$ for a small-sample.\n\nAlthough our analysis is better adapted to regions where thermal equilibrium\nhas not been reached, we will approximate the time-scale of relaxation/dephasing\neffects in the usual manner applicable to a thermally relaxed gas.\nWe should, however, keep in mind that the time-scales calculated that\nway are likely to provide overestimates and should be considered as\nworst case scenarios, as far as superradiance is concerned. We will\ntherefore determine collision time-scales given a temperature $T$\nand number density $n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}$ of hydrogen molecules, which\nare expected to be the main collisional partners of OH in molecular\ngas shells \\citep{Gray2012}. These parameters depend on the mass-loss\nrate of the central star in a circumstellar envelope \\citep{Goldreich1976}.\\textcolor{green}{{}\n}For instance, at a mass-loss rate of $1\\times10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$\nthe abundance of OH molecules is estimated to be approximately $10$\ncm$^{-3}$, while $n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}\\sim10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $r\\approx10^{16}$\ncm based on the study of different physical and chemical processes\ntaking place in the CSEs of OH-IR stars \\citep{Gray2005}.

Although these figures\nshould be viewed as worst case scenarios (i.e., lower limits), they\nallow us to get a sense of the time-scales involved. As we will see\nlater, these time-scales imply intensity variations that could last\nas long as several years.\n\n\n\\section{Analytical Model \\label{sec:Theory}}\n\nIn this section we use the formalism developed in \\citet{Gross1982}\nto describe the behavior of a superradiant system. Since, as will\nbe seen in Section \\ref{sec:Discussion}, the realization of superradiance\nsmall-sample is unlikely to take place in the CSEs of evolved stars\nfor the collisional time-scales previously calculated (see Paper I),\nwe focus our analysis on the case of a large-sample.\n\nTaking into account the dephasing/relaxation effects, the behavior\nof a superradiant system can be expressed by a set of so-called Maxwell-Bloch\nequations within the framework of the slowly varying envelope approximation\n(SVEA) \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}}{\\partial\\tau} & = & \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left(\\hat{P}_{0}^{+}\\hat{E}_{0}^{+}-\\hat{E}_{0}^{-}\\hat{P}_{0}^{-}\\right)-\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}}{T_{1}}\\label{eq:N-tau-dephase}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\hat{P}_{0}^{+}}{\\partial\\tau} & = & \\frac{2id^{2}}{\\hbar}\\hat{E}_{0}^{-}\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}-\\frac{\\hat{P}_{0}^{+}}{T_{2}}\\label{eq:P+-tau-dephase}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\hat{E}_{0}^{+}}{\\partial z} & = & \\frac{i\\omega}{2\\epsilon_{0}c}\\hat{P}_{0}^{-},\\label{eq:E-z-dephase}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $T_{1}$ is the (phenomenological) time-scale of non-coherent\npopulation relaxation (e.g., through inelastic collisions) and similarly\n$T_{2}$ for phase relaxation (e.g., through elastic collisions).\nThese equations were derived within the context of Heisenberg representation.\nThe quantities $\\hat{P}_{0}^{\\pm}$ and $\\hat{E}_{0}^{\\pm}$ are the\nenvelopes for the polarization $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}^{\\pm}$ and the electric\nfield $\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}^{\\pm}$ vectors, respectively, which are assumed\nto have the following form\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right) & = & \\hat{P}_{0}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right)e^{\\pm i\\omega\\tau}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\mathrm{m}}\\label{eq:P-wave}\\\\\n\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right) & = & \\hat{E}_{0}^{\\pm}\\left(z,\\tau\\right)e^{\\mp i\\omega\\tau}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\mathrm{m}},\\label{eq:E-wave}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ the unit vector indicating\nthe orientation of the molecular electric dipole moment. The population\ninversion density is given by (twice) $\\hat{\\mathbb{N}}$, while $d$\nand $\\omega$ are, respectively, the transition dipole matrix element\nand the radiation field's frequency at resonance with the molecular\ntransition. Equations (\\ref{eq:N-tau-dephase}) to (\\ref{eq:E-z-dephase})\nare derived using a two-level system model and describe the evolution\nof the matter-field system in the retarded-time frame $\\tau$ ($=t-z/c$\n, where $c$ is the speed of light). In the ISM, an OH sample interacting\nwith the radiation along the line-of-sight can be modeled by a cylindrical\nlarge-sample along the $z$-axis. Although a one-dimensional field\nequation discards the loss of radiation due to diffraction or transverse\neffects, it is an approximation that reduces the number of variables\nand allows us to move the analysis forward while retaining the essential\nphysics of the problem. Nonetheless, considerations of the sample's\ngeometry, described by the Fresnel number $F=A/\\left(\\lambda L\\right)$,\nwith $A$ and $L$ the cross-section and length of the sample, respectively,\nwill also enter our analysis.\n\nUnder the assumption that the different dephasing time-scales are\nsimilar (i.e., $T^{\\prime}\\equiv T_{1}=T_{2}$), the Maxwell-Bloch\nequations can be solved by effecting the following change of variables \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{\\mathbb{N}} & = & \\frac{N}{2V}\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)e^{-\\tau/T^{\\prime}}\\label{eq:N_dephase}\\\\\n\\hat{P}_{0}^{+} & = & \\frac{Nd}{2V}\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)e^{-\\tau/T^{\\prime}},\\label{eq:P_+_dephase}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\\noindent where $\\theta$ is the so-called Bloch angle and $N$ is\nthe number of inverted molecules at $\\tau=0$ in the sample volume\n$V$.

Furthermore, during\nthat same period the blue-shifted part of the spectrum only displayed\na monotonic decay.\n\nWe show in Figure \\ref{fig:Wolak} the results of calculations using\nour superradiance model (broken curve) superposed to the data from\n\\citet{Wolak2014} (solid curve) for the aforementioned flaring episode\nof the OH 1612 MHz line. Although the duration of the data does not\nallow to determine if the burst of radiation taking place between\napproximately Day 2800 and Day 5000 is a single occurrence or part\nof a series of bursts, the longer duration of the flare ($\\sim2000$\ndays) in comparison to case of U Ori and the expected limitation on\nthe dephasing time $T^{\\prime}$ seem to imply a single flare. Accordingly,\nour superradiance model yields $T_{\\mathrm{R}}=42$ days, $T^{\\prime}=61\\,T_{\\mathrm{R}}$,\nand $\\theta_{0}=2/\\sqrt{N}=2.8\\times10^{-4}$ rad ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}\\simeq25\\,T_{\\mathrm{R}}$),\nand provides a rewardingly nice match to the data. \n\nAs for U Ori, we note that the superradiance cylinder length $L=5.2\\times10^{3}$\ncm is orders of magnitude shorter than those expected for masers,\nimplying that a large number of superradiant large-samples are behind\nthe measured intensity variation, while the required dephasing time\n$T^{\\prime}\\simeq7$ years ($\\sim10^{8}$ sec and $\\simeq2.4\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$)\nis markedly longer than the mean collision times previously calculated\nfor $10^{4}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\le n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}\\le10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$\nat $T=100$ K, as expected.\n\n\n\\subsection{Transition Between Maser and Superradiance Modes\\label{sub:Transition-Between-Maser}}\n\nThe data sets from \\citet{Jewell1981} and \\citet{Wolak2014} both\nindicate transitions between periods of (quasi) steady state maser\nradiation and flaring episodes. Here we propose a scenario where such\ntransitions could take place within the context of the superradiance\nmodel.\n\nWe know from our discussion in Section \\ref{sec:Requirements-of-Superradiance}\nthat superradiance requires a dephasing time such that $T^{\\prime}>\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$.\nWe therefore surmise, because of the relationship between $\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$\nand $T_{\\mathrm{R}}$ given in Equation (\\ref{eq:delay-time-large-sample}),\nthe existence of a critical value $T_{\\mathrm{R,crit}}$ for the characteristic\ntime-scale of superradiance, which cannot be exceeded for superradiance\nto take place. That is, superradiance requires $T_{\\mathrm{R}}\\lesssim T_{\\mathrm{R,crit}}$\nwith\n\n\n", "index": 19, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nT_{\\mathrm{R,crit}}=\\frac{4T^{\\prime}}{\\left|\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{0}}{2\\pi}\\right)\\right|^{2}},\\label{eq:TRcrit}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"T_{\\mathrm{R,crit}}=\\frac{4T^{\\prime}}{\\left|\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{0}}{2\\pi}%&#10;\\right)\\right|^{2}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">R</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>crit</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>T</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></mrow><msup><mrow><mo>|</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01718.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\nIn the AGB phase, the mass-loss rate can change significantly during\nthermal pulsation periods, when the evolved star blows away its mass\nin the form of super winds, or when the circumstellar envelope starts\ndetaching from the star. These variations happen over relatively short\ntime-scales (i.e., on the order of a few years) and can result in\ncorrespondingly important changes in $L$ and $n$ in an OH large-sample.\nHowever, variation in $nL$ do not necessarily require abrupt disruptions\nin the CSE and could happen more gradually over time or even because\nof local variations on smaller spatial scales. \n\nWhatever the case may be, we can therefore imagine a situation where\na region harboring an OH maser could experience a change in $nL$\nthat would push it above the critical value given in Equation (\\ref{eq:nLcrit}).\nAt that point, the region over which $nL>\\left(nL\\right)_{\\mathrm{crit}}$\nwould erupt into a superradiance mode that would overtake the maser\nprocess, since superradiance is a lot more efficient at radiating\nthe energy stored in the sample (i.e., the superradiance radiation\nintensity scales with $N^{2}$). The initial maser radiation field\nitself could serve as a trigger for the superradiant event. Interestingly,\nour superradiance models for U Ori and IRAS18276-1431 show that $nL$\n(or $T_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{D}}$) is only a factor of\na few (at most an order of magnitude for U Ori) higher than the critical\nvalue.\n\nThe time-scales of the flaring events for U Ori and IRAS18276-1431\nindicate, however, that the whole maser region cannot at once act\nas a single coherent radiating system. Presumably some other factor\ndoes not allow this to take place. For example, this could be because\nthe level of velocity coherence is not high enough over the whole\nmasing region to ensure that the corresponding dephasing time is sufficiently\nlow to allow the entire region to act as a single superradiance system.\nOn the other hand, velocity coherence is likely to be sufficient locally\n(i.e., on scales on the order of $10^{3}$ cm to $10^{4}$ cm for\nthe examples considered here) to allow for the masing region to break-up\ninto a large number of smaller superradiance large-samples. Our calculations\npresented in Figures \\ref{fig:Jewell} and \\ref{fig:Wolak}, and their\nlevel of agreement with the corresponding data, provide credible evidence\nfor such a scenario.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion\\label{sec:Conclusion}}\n\nWe have applied the concept of superradiance introduced by \\citet{Dicke1954}\nto the OH molecule 1612 MHz spectral line often used for the detection\nof masers in CSEs of evolved stars. As the detection of 1612 MHz OH\nmasers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars implies the\nexistence of a population inversion and a high level of velocity coherence,\nand that these are two necessary requirements for superradiance, we\ninvestigated whether superradiance can also take place in these regions.\nOur analysis suggests that superradiance provides a valid explanation\nfor previous observations of intensity flares detected in that spectral\nline for the U Orionis Mira star \\citep{Jewell1981} and the IRAS18276-1431\npre-planetary nebula \\citep{Wolak2014}. The confirmation of superradiance\nin these sources would not only reveal a new range of unexplored physical\nconditions in the ISM but, on a more fundamental, also reveal the\nexistence of coherent quantum mechanical systems and corresponding\nentangled states over length scales reaching a few times $10^{4}$\ncm.\n\n\n\\acknowledgements{We are grateful to P.
