Spacecraft color appears to be red, \nwith $(V-R_c) = 1.1_{\\pm0.2}$ and a bolometric correction to the $R_c$ band of \n$(Bol-R_c) = -1.1_{\\pm0.2}$. The apparent magnitude, $R_c = 20.8_{\\pm0.2}$, is much fainter \nthan originally expected. These features lead\nto suggest a lower limit for the Bond albedo $\\alpha = 0.11_{\\pm 0.05}$ and confirm that \nincident Sun light is strongly reddened by {\\sc Gaia} through its on-board MLI \nblankets covering the solar shield.\n\nRelying on the {\\sc Gaia} figures, we found that VLT-class telescopes could yet be able to probe \ndistant spacecraft heading Mars, up to 30 million km away, while a broader optical coverage of\nthe forthcoming missions to Venus and Mars could be envisaged, providing to deal with space \nvehicles of minimum effective area ${\\cal A} \\ge 10^6$~cm$^2$.\nIn addition to L2 surveys, 2m-class telescopes could also effectively flank standard \nradar-ranging techniques in deep-space probe tracking along Earth's gravity-assist maneuvers \nfor interplanetary missions.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keyword}\n\nSpace vehicles; Techniques: high angular resolution; Astrometry and \n   celestial mechanics; Techniques: photometric\n\n\n\\end{keyword}\n\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\n\\parindent=0.5 cm\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[th!]\n\\center\n\\includegraphics[width=0.58\\hsize]{fig01.ps}\n\\caption{The apparent bolometric magnitude for man-made spacecraft at increasing distance \nfrom Earth, according to eq.~(\\ref{eq:2}).

For their particular \nposition, some $1.5~10^6$~km away, on opposite sides of Earth and therefore well beyond \nthe Moon, both locations are ideal lookouts for astrophysical observatories aimed at studying \nthe Sun (L1) and the deep Universe (L2), far from any anthropic contamination.\nThe L2 point, in particular, has been hosting a number of important astrophysical missions, \nstarting with the {\\sc Wmap}, {\\sc Planck} and {\\sc Herschel} probes, and currently continuing \nwith the {\\sc Gaia} mission, aimed at performing an exhaustive census of the Milky Way \nstellar population \\citep{debruijne12,cacciari15}.\nFollowing {\\sc Gaia}, other major space facilities are planned to be located in a so-called Halo L2 orbit\nin the forthcoming years. These include the James-Webb Space Telescope \\citep[{\\sc Jwst};][]{gardner06}, \nthe {\\sc Euclid} cosmological probe \\citep{laureijs10}, and the {\\sc Athena} X-ray observatory \\citep{barret13}.\n\nOptical ground tracking is yet of recognized importance for any L2 mission. For the co-rotating \norbit to be maintained within its nominal figures, in fact, we need to carefully check spacecraft \nduring its course along a complex Lissajous trajectory, as seen from Earth \n\\citep[e.g.][]{bray67,zagouras85,liu07,kolemen12,dutt11,qiao14}. This is also of special interest\nfor any space observatory (like {\\sc Gaia}, or the next {\\sc Jwst}) as its absolute inertial position\nis required with exquisite precision to allow, for instance, a confident measure of astronomical \nparallaxes of distant stars with the on-board instruments.\nIn this regard, radar-ranging techniques may actually provide a better measurement of spacecraft distance \nand radial velocity \\citep{imbriale03}, but telescope observations, from their side, take \nadvantage of a superior angular resolution, providing in principle more accurate \nastrometry and finer proper motion estimates \\citep{altmann11}.\n\nCompared to the observation of near-Earth satellites, however, optical tracking of distant probes, in L2 \nand on route to even farther interplanetary distances, has to deal with much fainter target \nmagnitudes, a drawback that urges a substantial improvement in terms of telescope skills and \nespecially of observing techniques to effectively assess our deep-space situational awareness\n\\citep[e.g.][]{mooney06,ruprecht14,woods14}.\n\nIn this contribution we want therefore to briefly assess some technical issues (Sec.~2) dealing\nwith accurate ground tracking of deep-space probes at optical wavelength, taking fresh observations \nof the {\\sc Gaia} spacecraft (Sec.~3) as a pilot case for tuning up our theoretical analysis. \nThe relevant photometric figures for {\\sc Gaia} will constrain the required telescope performance, \nfor the optical observations to consistently complement standard radar-tracking techniques \nas in the forthcoming space missions to Mars and other planets of the solar system\n(Sec.~4). Our conclusions will be briefly stressed in Sec.~5.\n\n\n\n\\section{Apparent magnitude of distant spacecraft}\n\n\nDepending on its physical properties, a satellite under solar illumination reflects a fraction \n$\\alpha$ (the so-called Bond albedo) of the incident flux. The remaining fraction of the input energy \nis retained and heats the body up to an equilibrium temperature that leads to a balance between \nthe absorbed and re-emitted flux. At Earth's heliocentric distance, this temperature cannot \nexceed 120$^\\circ$C \\citep[e.g.][]{gilmore02}, so that thermal emission of spacecraft in the terrestrial \nneighborhood (and beyond) is only relevant at mid/far-infrared wavelength.\n\nIf a probe offers a cross-section $s^2$ to Sun's light, being $s$ its reference scale-size,\nand if we assume the illuminated body to reflect isotropically, then the apparent bolometric magnitude of \na spacecraft placed at a distance $d$ from Earth's surface (at Sun's opposition)\\footnote{Although, \nstrictly speaking, $d$ is a topocentric distance, to all extent, for a distant spacecraft in L2 \nand beyond, it basically coincides with the geocentric distance, as well.} simply scales as the \nratio of the incident solar flux at Earth and at the spacecraft distance, so that \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nm_{\\rm bol} - m^{\\rm bol}_\\odot = -2.5 \\log \\left[\\left(\\frac{D_\\odot}{D_\\odot+d}\\right)^2\n\\left(\\frac{s^2}{4 \\pi d^2}\\right)\\right], \n\\label{eq:1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"m_{\\rm bol}-m^{\\rm bol}_{\\odot}=-2.5\\log\\left[\\left(\\frac{D_{\\odot}}{D_{\\odot}%&#10;+d}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{s^{2}}{4\\pi d^{2}}\\right)\\right],\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>m</mi><mi>bol</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2299</mo><mi>bol</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>2.5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msup><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>d</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04719.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the numerical constant is \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 8083, "prevtext": "\nwhere $D_\\odot = 1.49\\,10^{13}$~cm is the astronomical unit (AU) and\n$m^{\\rm bol}_\\odot = -26.85$ is the apparent bolometric magnitude of the Sun, as seen from \nEarth \\citep[e.g.][]{karttunen96}. \nWith the relevant substitutions, and expressing the spacecraft distance $u = d/D_\\odot$ in AU,\neq.

A first crucial piece of information deals with \nastrometry.\n\nFor the astrometric solution of the CCD images, after standard reduction\nprocedures with {\\sc IRAF}\\footnote{See the URLs: {\\sl http://iraf.noao.edu.}}, \nwe relied on the {\\tt WCSTools} package\\footnote{See the URLs: {\\sl http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/wcstools.}} \nto pick up a reference grid of template stars across the field \nof view and finally set the World Coordinate System (WCS) of the corresponding image.\nThe 50 brightest objects in each field, as detected by the {\\sc IRAF} task {\\tt STARFIND},\nhave been matched by the {\\tt WCSTools IMWCS} task with the corresponding HST Guide \nstar Catalogue II (GSC-II) \\citep{russell90}\\footnote{See the URL: \n{\\it http://tdc-www.harward.edu/software/catalogues/\\ gsc2.html}.} \navailable by default to constrain the WCS across the frame.\nThe WCS is the relationship between the pixel coordinates and the celestial coordinate, \nand it is written in a standard way in the FITS header. \nThe precise astrometric solution is then refined by means of the {\\tt WCSTools SCAT} \nand the {\\tt IRAF CCFIND} and {\\tt CCMAP} tasks. In particular, {\\tt SCAT} retrieves \nthe GSC-II catalogue of the field, while {\\tt CCFIND} uses the image WCS to convert\nthe celestial coordinates into image pixel coordinates and refine the latter ones by\nusing a centroid algorithm.\nThe matched coordinates are finally used by {\\tt CCMAP} to compute a new plate solution\nin the RA and DEC domain by a low-order polynomial fit. The astrometric solution is \ndirectly inspected by over-plotting the reference catalogue sources on the \nastrometrically calibrated image.\n\nOverall, our procedure secured an internal astrometric accuracy of $0.38_{\\pm 0.18}$~arcsec\n(rms) in the photometric centroid determination of {\\sc Gaia}'s {\\it individual} observations \n(see Table~\\ref{t01}).\\footnote{For the illustrative scope of our analysis, we relied here on \nthe GSC-II catalog, a default reference for {\\tt WCSTools} to set the astrometric solution. \nOther catalogs could, however, be implemented providing to set them in appropriate format. \nOf these, especially the PPMXL \\citep{roeser10} and CMC-15 \\citep{cmc15} compilations may prove to be \nviable alternatives to improve accuracy at least in selected sky regions.}\n\nThough slightly elongated, the star figures in the telescope images did not prove to severely \naffect the astrometric solution across the field, provided the trailing intensity of the\nastrometric calibrators ($I$) does not vary (or just vary in a predictable way) \nalong the exposure time.\\footnote{Among others, relevant change along trailing intensity of stars could \neither be due to any small drift in the sideral and ``on-target'' telescope tracking, or \nto any unperceived tiny cloud crossing the field during exposure etc.}\nThis is, actually, a crucial requirement for the photometric barycenter of stellar tracks to \nconsistently tie to the {\\it luminosity-weighted} time barycenter\n($t_o$) of the exposure. By definition, for the latter, we have\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 14585, "prevtext": "\nIn previous equations, $\\mu_{\\rm sky}$ is sky surface brightness, $n_o$ and {\\sc Dqe} are the reference \nphoton number for the magnitude zero point and the detector quantum efficiency, respectively, according \nto the photometric band of our observations.

A first crucial piece of information deals with \nastrometry.\n\nFor the astrometric solution of the CCD images, after standard reduction\nprocedures with {\\sc IRAF}\\footnote{See the URLs: {\\sl http://iraf.noao.edu.}}, \nwe relied on the {\\tt WCSTools} package\\footnote{See the URLs: {\\sl http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/wcstools.}} \nto pick up a reference grid of template stars across the field \nof view and finally set the World Coordinate System (WCS) of the corresponding image.\nThe 50 brightest objects in each field, as detected by the {\\sc IRAF} task {\\tt STARFIND},\nhave been matched by the {\\tt WCSTools IMWCS} task with the corresponding HST Guide \nstar Catalogue II (GSC-II) \\citep{russell90}\\footnote{See the URL: \n{\\it http://tdc-www.harward.edu/software/catalogues/\\ gsc2.html}.} \navailable by default to constrain the WCS across the frame.\nThe WCS is the relationship between the pixel coordinates and the celestial coordinate, \nand it is written in a standard way in the FITS header. \nThe precise astrometric solution is then refined by means of the {\\tt WCSTools SCAT} \nand the {\\tt IRAF CCFIND} and {\\tt CCMAP} tasks. In particular, {\\tt SCAT} retrieves \nthe GSC-II catalogue of the field, while {\\tt CCFIND} uses the image WCS to convert\nthe celestial coordinates into image pixel coordinates and refine the latter ones by\nusing a centroid algorithm.\nThe matched coordinates are finally used by {\\tt CCMAP} to compute a new plate solution\nin the RA and DEC domain by a low-order polynomial fit. The astrometric solution is \ndirectly inspected by over-plotting the reference catalogue sources on the \nastrometrically calibrated image.\n\nOverall, our procedure secured an internal astrometric accuracy of $0.38_{\\pm 0.18}$~arcsec\n(rms) in the photometric centroid determination of {\\sc Gaia}'s {\\it individual} observations \n(see Table~\\ref{t01}).\\footnote{For the illustrative scope of our analysis, we relied here on \nthe GSC-II catalog, a default reference for {\\tt WCSTools} to set the astrometric solution. \nOther catalogs could, however, be implemented providing to set them in appropriate format. \nOf these, especially the PPMXL \\citep{roeser10} and CMC-15 \\citep{cmc15} compilations may prove to be \nviable alternatives to improve accuracy at least in selected sky regions.}\n\nThough slightly elongated, the star figures in the telescope images did not prove to severely \naffect the astrometric solution across the field, provided the trailing intensity of the\nastrometric calibrators ($I$) does not vary (or just vary in a predictable way) \nalong the exposure time.\\footnote{Among others, relevant change along trailing intensity of stars could \neither be due to any small drift in the sideral and ``on-target'' telescope tracking, or \nto any unperceived tiny cloud crossing the field during exposure etc.}\nThis is, actually, a crucial requirement for the photometric barycenter of stellar tracks to \nconsistently tie to the {\\it luminosity-weighted} time barycenter\n($t_o$) of the exposure. By definition, for the latter, we have\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{t_o}{t_{\\rm exp}} = \\frac{\\int \\tau I(\\tau) d\\tau}{\\int I(\\tau) d\\tau}\\, \n\\frac{1}{\\int d\\tau} \\le 1.\n\\label{eq:9}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{t_{o}}{t_{\\rm exp}}=\\frac{\\int\\tau I(\\tau)d\\tau}{\\int I(\\tau)d\\tau}\\,%&#10;\\frac{1}{\\int d\\tau}\\leq 1.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>o</mi></msub><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>exp</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04719.tex", "nexttext": "\nIn the equation, $\\theta_{\\rm mas}$ is expressed in mas (milliarcsec) unit and $\\zeta$ in \narcsec hr$^{-1}$, as in Fig.~\\ref{f02}.\nWith the {\\sc Gaia} typical figures, $t_o$ has to be known within a few seconds, at most.\nAccording to the proper-motion constraints of Fig.~\\ref{f02}, this is also the accuracy level for \ntracking interplanetary spacecraft, while a better tuned clock ($\\sigma(t_o) \\ll 0.2$~sec) is\ndevised, on the contrary, when observing fast-moving ($\\zeta \\gg 10^3$) Earth- and Moon-orbiting satellites.\n\n\\subsubsection{Locating L2 spacecraft}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f05} shows that {\\sc Gaia} position consistently compares with its \nnominal trajectory along the Oct 17, 2014 night, as \npredicted by the topocentric ephemeris from the JPL Horizons Solar System Dynamics (SSD)\nInterface.\\footnote{See the URL: {\\sl http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi.}}\nThe mean coordinate offsets of our data (in the sense ``observed--computed'') and their\ncorresponding $\\sigma$ uncertainty amount to ($\\Delta$RA, $\\Delta$Dec) = ($0.10_{\\pm 0.08}, \n-0.09_{\\pm 0.10}$) arcsec, which lead to a mean transverse offset\n$\\Delta_{GAIA} = 0.13_{\\pm 0.09}$~arcsec.

(\\ref{eq:sn}) \n(with ``on-target'' telescope tracking, that is for $\\Delta \\mu_{\\rm sat} = 0$) \ncan be solved to obtain the faintest possible magnitude we could reach and, by means of \neq. (\\ref{eq:3}) and (\\ref{eq:2}), its corresponding maximum geocentric distance.\n\nAs probe needs to be under Sun's illumination to be detected from Earth, this also sets \na constraint to the allowed range of the phase angle, depending on spacecraft \n(geocentric) distance and physical structure.\nIf planar components (i.e. large solar panels etc., either facing Earth or Sun) are the\nprevailing features of the probe, then the simple geometrical arguments outlined in \nSec.~3.2 for the case of {\\sc Gaia} indicate that its apparent luminosity under different view \nangles scales as $\\cos (\\phi)$. This evidently implies that $|\\phi| \\le 90^o$ for the probe \nto be visible.\nMuch larger values of $\\phi$ may, however, be allowed to roughly spherical shapes, as a \ncardioid-shaped luminosity law, as $[1+cos (\\phi)]/2$, \\citep[e.g.][]{meeus98} holds in \nthis case.\n\nThe visibility map for the illustrative case of either a spheric or straight a planar \nsatellite geometry is sketched in the two panels of Fig.~\\ref{f16}, respectively. \nCalculations have been carried out for the {\\sc Gaia}'s effective area \n${\\cal A} = \\alpha s^2 \\simeq 10^5$~cm$^2$ (which assumes a conservative albedo value\n$\\alpha = 0.11$) supposing to detect the spacecraft at a $(S/N)$\nratio better than 5. With the 8m-class (or bigger) \ntelescopes currently in use, one sees that an important region can be explored, well \nbeyond the Earth's influence sphere (that embodies the Lagrangian L1 and L2 points)  \nreaching, for instance, distant spacecraft along their initial Hohmann transfer \nto Mars, up to geocentric distances of some 30 million km (roughly 0.2~AU). \n\nEven 2m-class telescopes could however usefully track deep-space probes,\nfor instance during their flyby approach to Earth for gravity sling toward external planets. \nSuccessful observations of the Rosetta spacecraft \\citep{glassmeier07}, along its 2005 and\n2007 gravity-assist maneuvers \\citep[e.g.][]{bedient05,dillon05,hill05,james05,juels05,\nkusnirak05a,kusnirak05b,manca05,stevens05,ticha05,birtwhistle07a,birtwhistle07b,birtwhistle07c,\nbittesini07a,bittesini07b,bittesini07c,donato07,hill07a,hill07b,kowalski07}\\footnote{DASO Circulars\nare made available in electronic form at the URL: {\\sl http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/DASO/DASO.html}.}\nare a relevant example of such a kind of applications. The current Hayabusa~2 mission \n\\citep{kuninaka13} could soon provide another intersting case to benchmark the method.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\hsize]{fig15.ps}\n\\caption{Same as Fig.~\\ref{f16} but for 2m (green), 8m (dark green) and 40m (pale green) \ntelescopes looking (at a $S/N \\sim 5$ or better threshold) at a deep-space spherical probe of  \n{\\sc Gaia}'s  10$\\times$ enhanced effective area (namely ${\\cal A} = 10^6$~cm$^2$). \nUnder these more favourable circumstances, note that a VLT-class telescope could yet\nconfidently track a spacecraft along most of its Hohmann trajectory to Mars and Venus,\nwhile a 2m telescope could, in general, effectively probe distant spacecraft \nsome 40 million km away from Earth.\n}\n\\label{f17}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAccording to Fig.~\\ref{f16}, optical tracking is of lesser point for any space\nmission toward inner planets (i.e.\\ Venus and Mercury). This is because the orbit\ngeometry leads probes usually to appear from Earth at large phase angles, thus\npoorly reflecting Sun's light in our direction.\nAn enhanced spacecraft effective area-- either in terms of better reflectance \nto improve the albedo or directly by increasing the physical size of the\ntarget, as likely the case of the forthcoming (manned) missions to Mars-- \ncould be the obvious issue in this case,\nas we show in the illustrative case of Fig.~\\ref{f17}. By the way, a closer look to \nFig.~\\ref{f16} also shows that spherical spacecraft would better perform than other \nprobes with more planar surfaces.\n\n\\section{Summary \\& Conclusions}\n\nWe assessed in some detail the observing performance of optical telescope-tracking techniques, \nfor accurate characterization of deep-space probes around the Earth-Sun libration point L2 and\nbeyond, toward interplanetary travels. We provided a general estimate of the expected S/N \nratio, quantifying the superior improvement of on-target tracking, a mandatory requirement, \nespecially when observing with small-class telescopes.\n\nThe current {\\sc Gaia} mission has been taken as a pilot case for our discussion.\nIn this regard, we reported on fresh optical photometry and astrometric results, that led to\nangularly locate the spacecraft across the sky within $0.13_{\\pm 0.09}$~arcsec, or \n$0.9_{\\pm0.6}$~km. Photometric results also indicate for \n{\\sc Gaia} a quite red color, with $(V-R_c) = 1.1_{\\pm0.2}$ and an apparent magnitude\n$R_c = 20.8_{\\pm0.2}$, much fainter than expected and dimmed by a large bolometric\ncorrection $(Bol-R_c) = -1.1_{\\pm0.2}$. These features lead\nto a lower limit for the Bond albedo $\\alpha = 0.11_{\\pm 0.05}$ and confirm that \nthe unabsorbed fraction of the incident Sun light is strongly reddened by\nthe MLI blankets, that cover the spacecraft sun-shield.\n\nThese observations provided us with the reference figures to consistently assess the detection\nthreshold for any deep-space probe toward inner and outer planets of the Solar System.\nWaiting for next-generation (E-ELT) telescopes, yet VLT-class instruments could \nbe able to track distant spacecraft, like {\\sc Gaia}, along their initial Hohmann \ntransfer to Mars, some 30 million km away. As successfully done with the Rosetta spacecraft,\nwe confirm that even 2m-class telescopes could usefully help track deep-space probes, \nalong their Earth's gravity-assist maneuvers heading interplanetary targets.\n\nWe finally demonstrated that optical tracking from 8m ground telescopes could fully flank \nthe standard radar-ranging techniques to probe distant spacecraft along the forthcoming \nmissions to Venus and Mars, providing to deal with (round-shaped) space vehicles of minimum \neffective area ${\\cal A} = \\alpha s^2 \\ge 10^6$~cm$^2$.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nWe would like to acknowledge the timely and very competent review of the two anonymous referees,\nthat greatly helped refine the original version of our study.\n\nThis work made extensive use of the {\\sc IRAF} package, written and supported by the \nNational Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) in Tucson, Arizona.

See: {\\sl http://www.esa.int/Our\\_Activities/Space\\_Science/\\\nGaia/Gaia\\_factsheet} for more details.}\nAs from eq.~(\\ref{eq:3}), this figure can be linked to the apparent $R_c$ magnitude by correcting\nfor the appropriate bolometric correction ($BC^\\prime_R$) and the spacecraft albedo ($\\alpha$).\nBoth these quantities directly relates to the reflectance spectrum of the probe along the entire \nwavelength range, a feature that can only be poorly known {\\it a priori} and needs to be conveniently\nassessed ``on the fly''. \nFor this task, as a part of the characterization checks during the early phases of the {\\sc Gaia} mission \n\\citep{altmann14}, narrow-band multicolor photometry was acquired in early 2014 with the {\\sc Grond} \nimager at the ESO 2.2m telescope in La Silla. This allowed us to reconstruct the spacecraft reflectance \nspectrum along the 4500-13000~\\AA\\ wavelength range and therefrom derive the spacecraft colors\nduring the ``face-on'' experiments and later along the standard operation phase.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.97\\hsize]{fig12.ps}\n\\caption{The {\\sc Gaia} color properties, as derived from the {\\sc Grond} reflectance curves of \n\\citet{altmann14}, are assessed in the $(B-V)$ vs.\\ $(V-R_c)$ plane. The spacecraft location\nis compared with the stellar locus for dwarf and giant stars of different spectral type (as\nlabelled on the plot), according to \\citet{pecaut13} and\nand \\citet{houdashelt00}, respectively. The shaded triangular region on the plot edges\nthe allowed color range of {\\sc Gaia} (including the experimented ``face-on'' orientation, as\ndiscussed in the text), accounting for the reported variability of the spacecraft reflectance. \nAs a reference, the Sun is also marked on the plot, together with the derived colors of the \n{\\sc Planck} probe, according to \\citet{altmann14}.\n}\n\\label{f14}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs far as the $(B-V)$ and the $(V-R_c)$ colors are concerned, the spacecraft \nlocation is compared in Fig.~\\ref{f14} with the Sun and the locus for dwarf and giant stars of \ndifferent spectral type. The empirical compilation of \\citet{pecaut13} for MK-class V stars is \nadopted, for this comparison, together with the theoretical models of giant stars from \\citet{houdashelt00}.\nAs a further interesting match, in the figure we also added the colors of {\\sc Planck}, as derived from \nthe original reflectance spectrum of \\citet{altmann14}. Contrary to {\\sc Planck}, which resulted to \nbe a quite effective proxy of the Sun, {\\sc Gaia} roughly behaves like a red dwarf of very late \nM spectral type, with an even more depleted $B$ luminosity (i.e.\\ ``redder'' $B-V$ color).\nIn addition, one has to report from the {\\sc Grond} data, an important (and yet partly unexplained) \nspectral variability of the probe, with its optical colors actually cornered within the wide region \nmarked in Fig.~\\ref{f14}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.97\\hsize]{fig13.ps}\n\\caption{The observed {\\sc Gaia} $(V-R_c)$ color is contrasted in the plot to constrain the \nspacecraft bolometric correction.

Differently from {\\sc Planck}, {\\sc Gaia}'s color properties point to a much\nlarger correction, that we can tentatively place around a value of $BC^\\prime_R \\simeq -1.1\\pm 0.2$~mag, \nalthough with a large uncertainty, further magnified by the spacecraft spectral variability.\n\nWith the relevant figures, under Lambertian assumptions, eq.~(\\ref{eq:3}) takes the final form as\n\n", "index": 29, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n20.8_{\\pm 0.2} -0.4_{\\pm 0.3} = 16.9 +1.1_{\\pm 0.2} -2.5\\,\\log \\alpha,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"20.8_{\\pm 0.2}-0.4_{\\pm 0.3}=16.9+1.1_{\\pm 0.2}-2.5\\,\\log\\alpha,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mn>20.8</mn><mrow><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.2</mn></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mn>0.4</mn><mrow><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.3</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>16.9</mn><mo>+</mo><msub><mn>1.1</mn><mrow><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>2.5</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
