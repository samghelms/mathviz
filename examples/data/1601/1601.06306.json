Among them the most studied candidate\nis the Ising model~\\cite{lenz,ising} in one, two, and three\nspatial dimensions finding application in a wide range of physical\nsystems ranging from pure and random\nferromagnets~\\cite{baxter,binder77,nattermann98,newman99,landau-binder}\nto neurons~\\cite{hopfield82,amit89} and hadronic\nmatter~\\cite{kogut04}. For $D \\geq 2$ spatial dimensions the usual\nIsing model for a lattice with infinite size possesses a thermal\nphase transition of second order, signaling the spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of mirror symmetry and the emergence of a\nferromagnetic (for attractive spin-spin interaction) phase. This\ntransition is characterized by the presence of a critical\ntemperature $T_{\\rm c}$ at which a scale-free behavior dominates\nthe underlying phenomenology~\\cite{fisher71,privman90,binder92}.\nThe absence of a characteristic scale at the critical point is\nrelated to the divergence of the correlation length $\\xi$ which in\nturn leads to the appearance of a variety of power laws with\nassociated critical exponents. One of the main tasks in the study\nof models showing critical behavior is the determination of the\nvalues of these exponents which are then related to the respective\nuniversality classes.\n\nFor $D = 2$ the Ising model with next-neighbor interactions is\nanalytically solvable~\\cite{onsager44} while for $D > 2$ one has\nto rely on numerical simulations and other approximate type of\nsolutions for its study, see e.g.~\\cite{newman99,landau-binder}\nand references therein. Employing numerical methods constrains the\nmathematical analysis on lattices with finite size introducing an\nadditional scale in the problem. This adds a complication in the\ndevelopment of methods to calculate the critical temperature as\nwell as the critical exponents, usually solved by the so called\nfinite-size scaling analysis~\\cite{fisher71,privman90,binder92}.\nThis requires the determination of observables in lattices of\nincreasing size in order to extrapolate to the infinite size\nlimit. Coming back to the 2D Ising model, despite of being\nanalytically solvable, it offers a playground for testing a\nvariety of simulation algorithms~\\cite{newman99} and in fact a\nvery hard one, since its finite-size scaling analysis possesses\nsevere peculiarities due to the presence of significant,\nnon-universal, logarithmic corrections~\\cite{ferdinand69,mccoy}.\n\nA dominant feature of the critical state in Ising-like systems,\nconsequence of the absence of a characteristic length scale, is\nthe formation of self-similar ordered clusters of spins with\nfractal geometry. The associated fractal dimension of the\nresulting set of ordered clusters is related to the isothermal\ncritical exponent $\\delta$ which in turn determines the\nuniversality class of the undergoing transition. Thus, the\ncalculation of the exponent $\\delta$ is a very significant task in\nthe simulations of critical systems. Usually, in order to obtain\nthe value of the exponent $\\delta$ one can either calculate the\nfractal dimension of the ordered clusters at $T_{\\rm\nc}$~\\cite{coniglio89} or estimate the so called constrained\neffective potential~\\cite{fukuda75}. For lattices with finite\nsizes the fractal geometry is an approximate property expressed\nthrough self-similar structure between two scales, the constrained\neffective potential acquires finite volume corrections and the\ncritical temperature is replaced by the pseudocritical one, making\nthe related analysis a highly non-trivial task. Nevertheless the\naforementioned methods work quite well for the case of the 3D\nIsing model~\\cite{tsypin94}. However they practically fail to give\nthe right answer in the 2D case since they suffer from the\npresence of large finite-size corrections, that are hard to\ncontrol.\n\nIn the present work we develop a method to calculate the critical\nexponent $\\delta$ for Ising systems based on properties of the\nmagnetization time series after thermal equilibrium is reached.\nThe idea is to consider the mean magnetization time series\nobtained by averaging over a connected small subset of the\nlattice. The main advantage of considering such small domains\nrelies on the fact that the number of the microstates determining\ntheir thermodynamic properties decreases exponentially with\ndecreasing domain size. Thus, for small domains a much better\ncovering of the available phase space can be achieved. On the\nother hand the domains are always open systems and therefore their\nthermodynamic properties are quite different from those of the\nentire (closed) lattice. Based on the distribution of the mean\nmagnetization values within such a small domain one observes that\neach domain equilibrates at its own effective temperature. In fact\nwith decreasing size the effective temperature decreases too. The\nmethod of analysis of the domain magnetization time series at\nequilibrium makes use of fact that for a closed system the\ndistribution of waiting times in the neighborhood of the ``false\"\nvacuum, exhibiting the spontaneous symmetry breaking, is known for\ntemperatures $T \\lesssim T_{\\rm c}$. Namely at $T=T_{\\rm c}$ the\ndistribution is a power law with an exponent directly related to\nthe isothermal critical exponent $\\delta$~\\cite{Contoyiannis2002},\nwhile for $T < T_{\\rm c}$ the power law gets gradually destructed\nand exponential tails appear. However, for small to moderate\nwaiting times the power-law description is still valid and the\nconnection to $\\delta$ holds too~\\cite{Contoyiannis2007}.\n\nWe use here this information to extract the isothermal critical\nexponent $\\delta$ for an Ising system. Our basic assumption,\nvalidated by our numerical results, is that the waiting-time\ndistributions derived in\nRefs.~\\cite{Contoyiannis2002,Contoyiannis2007} are valid also for\nan open Ising spin system in a thermal environment. Thus, we\nconsider an ensemble consisting of domains of increasing size,\nparts of an Ising lattice at the corresponding (pseudo)critical\ntemperature. For each such domain we calculate the mean\nmagnetization as a function of time for a long time interval. Time\nis measured in single spin flips of the entire lattice. Based on\nthis time series we calculate the distribution of waiting times in\nthe neighborhood of $\\langle M_{\\mathcal{D}_i} \\rangle = 0$ for\neach domain $\\mathcal{D}_i$ and from these distributions we\ndetermine $\\delta$. For very small domains the corresponding\neffective temperature is also extremely small and the distribution\nof the waiting times becomes pure exponential containing no\ninformation for the critical exponent $\\delta$. Thus we use a\ncutoff on the minimum size of the considered domains. We apply\nthis approach to the 2D Ising model on the square lattice with\nnearest-neighbor interactions and we obtain a highly accurate\nestimate for $\\delta$. Since the developed method is quite\ngeneral, it can in principle be applied to a wide class of spin\nlattices in two, but also higher dimensions.\n\nThe rest of paper is organized as follows: In\nSec.~\\ref{sec:strategy} we present the general strategy and the\nmethod of analysis employed to calculate $\\delta$ for arbitrary\nspin models of Ising type on the lattice. In\nSec.~\\ref{sec:results} we apply the proposed method to the case of\nthe 2D Ising model on the square lattice and we discuss the\nobtained results. Finally, our concluding remarks are presented in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:conclusions}.\n\n\\section{Strategy and method of analysis}\n\\label{sec:strategy}\n\nWe consider the fluctuations of the magnetization for a spin model\nof the typical Ising form at thermal equilibrium defined by the\nHamiltonian~\\cite{landau-binder}\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{H} = - \\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle} J_{ij} s_i s_j,\n\\label{eq:Ising}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathcal{H}=-\\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle}J_{ij}s_{i}s_{j},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u210b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow></munder><mrow><msub><mi>J</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06306.tex", "nexttext": "\n$L_d$ counts the number of sites in $\\mathcal{D}$ and $n$ is the\ntime unit measured in the minimum time needed for the flip of a\nsingle spin.

We investigated the\nequilibrium dynamics of the Ising spins, mainly for a lattice\nset-up with linear size $L=256$.\n\nIn the pre-equilibrium phase the spin dynamics is simulated using\nthe Wolff's cluster algorithm~\\cite{wolff89}, which is a variant\nof the original Swendsen-Wang algorithm~\\cite{swendsen87}, for\nreasons that are exemplified below. In the Swendsen-Wang\nalgorithm, small and large clusters are created. While the\ndestruction of critical correlations is predominantly due to the\nlarge clusters, a considerable amount of effort is spent on\nconstructing the smaller clusters. In Wolff's implementation, no\ndecomposition of the entire spin configuration into clusters takes\nplace. On the contrary, only a single cluster is formed, which is\nthen always flipped. If this cluster turns out to be large,\ncorrelations are destroyed as effectively as by means of the large\nclusters in the Swendsen-Wang algorithm, without the effort of\ncreating the smaller clusters that fill up the remainder of the\nlattice. If the Wolff cluster turns out to be small, then not much\nis gained, but also not much computational effort is required. As\na result, critical slowing down using the Wolff implementation is\nsuppressed even more strongly than in the Swendsen-Wang case.\n\nAfter reaching equilibrium, a hybrid algorithm is employed\ninvolving mainly single spin flips mixed with rare Wolff's steps\nto increase ergodicity. The latter is reflected in the smooth form\nobtained for the magnetization histograms. Actually the obtained\nresults are robust against changes of the simulation algorithm\nprovided that time is expressed in single spin flips. Thus, for\nexample, employing Wolff's cluster algorithm one has to take into\naccount the size of the cluster when assigning a characteristic\ntime to the cluster flipping. This increases the corresponding\nwaiting times.\n\nIn our calculations we used square domains of linear sizes $L_d=7,\n13,\\ldots, 27$. The pseudocritical temperature $T_{c}\\approx 2.29$\nis estimated through the magnetization histogram as the minimum\ntemperature for which symmetry breaking is not yet globally\nestablished. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:fig1}(a) - (d) we show the\nmagnetization probability distribution for domains with $L_d=7,\n17, 27$ as well as for the entire lattice $L=256$. In each case it\nis calculated using a time series of $10^6$ steps after reaching\nequilibrium. In accordance with the discussion in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:strategy} we clearly observe that the magnetization\ndistribution for decreasing linear size corresponds to a spin\nsystem with decreasing temperature. The arrows indicate the\nhalf-variance region around the $M=0$ value.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=8 cm]{fig3.eps}}\n\\caption{(color online) The distribution $\\rho_{L_d,c}(\\tau)$\nshown by stars for (a) $L_d=7$ and (b) $L_d=9$ in a\ndouble-logarithmic scale. In both panels the red solid line\nillustrates the fitting result obtained using the function of\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:lamdisbcr}).} \\label{fig:fig3}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:fig2}(a) - (d) we show the corresponding\ndistribution of the waiting times $\\tau$ in the half-variance\nregion indicated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:fig1}(a) - (d). We clearly\nobserve the power-law behavior for low $\\tau$-values when $L_d\n\\geq 17$. For $L_d=7$ the effective temperature in the domain is\nfar below the pseudocritical one corresponding to this lattice\nsize [see the distribution in Fig.~\\ref{fig:fig1}(a)] and\ntherefore no power-law behavior is clearly observed. Nevertheless\na fit using the form dictated by Eq.~(\\ref{eq:lamdisbcr}) works\nstill sufficiently well, providing a reasonable value for the\nexponent $\\zeta$. This is demonstrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:fig3},\nwhere we plot with stars the distribution $\\rho_{L_d,c}(\\tau)$ for\n$L_d=7$ (a) and $L_d=9$ (b), respectively. The corresponding\nfitting results are shown by the red solid lines in the two\npanels. They lead to $\\zeta(L_d) \\approx 4.3$ for both values of\n$L_d$. As the size of the domain decreases, the exponential tail\ndominates more and more, extending also to the low-$\\tau$ region\nand the power-law behavior gradually disappears. Therefore we do\nnot consider domains with $L_d < 7$. For $L_d > 10$ we fit the\nwaiting-time distribution with a power law in the low-$\\tau$\nregion ($\\tau < 20$) for each considered domain and we extract the\nexponent $p_2(L_d)=\\zeta(L_d) / [\\zeta(L_d)-1]$. We check the\nvalidity of the power-law description by repeating the fit with\nthe form given in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:lamdisbcr}) and comparing the\nobtained value of $p_2(L_d)$ to the value found by the direct\npower-law fit. We observe that for $L_d > 11$ the two values\npractically coincide.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:fig4} we show graphically the results obtained\nfor the characteristic exponent $p_2(L_d)$ and for $L_d \\geq 9$.\nWe observe a rapid convergence to the value $(\\delta +1) / \\delta\n= 16/15 \\approx 1.07$, shown by the red solid line. For large\ndomain sizes the errors increase due to the fact that the\nmicrostate space increases exponentially and therefore the\nstatistical fluctuations in the calculation of the waiting time\ndistribution increase too. The isothermal critical exponent\n$\\delta$ is estimated via $\\delta=\\frac{1}{p_2(L_d) - 1}$. For the\n2D Ising model this calculation leads to the result $\\delta_{\\rm\n{2D}}=14.7 \\pm 1.4$ (obtained by a fit with a constant for $L_d\n\\geq 15$) which is in very good agreement with the exact value\n$\\delta_{\\rm {2D}} = 15$~\\cite{baxter,mccoy}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=8 cm]{fig4.eps}}\n\\caption{(color online) The exponent $p_2(L_d)$ calculated from\nthe distributions $\\rho_{L_d}(\\tau)$ as explained in the text.

Our method makes use of critical\ncharacteristics present in post-equilibrium spin dynamics as\nrevealed in Refs.~\\cite{Contoyiannis2002,Contoyiannis2007}. In\nfact the effective magnetization dynamics close to the vacuum\nundergoing the spontaneous symmetry breaking is similar to\nintermittent dynamics close to a bifurcation. The information\nconcerning $\\delta$ is encoded in the distribution of waiting\ntimes of the magnetization time series near the broken vacuum. The\nkey ingredient of the method is the calculation of the\nmagnetization time series within domains of varying size embedded\nin the spin lattice. These domains equilibrate locally to a lower\ntemperature than that of the entire lattice. When this temperature\nis not too far from the pseudocritical one, then the waiting-time\ndistribution carries information of the critical point related to\n$\\delta$, as shown in Ref.~\\cite{Contoyiannis2007}. Furthermore,\nit can be calculated with higher accuracy since the number of\nmicrostates of the smaller domain is exponentially reduced\ncompared to that of the entire lattice. For small to moderate\nvalues of the waiting times, the associated distribution is a\npower law with an exponent which is related to $\\delta$ and can be\nestimated employing a suitable fitting procedure. Subsequently the\nsequence of the fitted exponents as a function of the increasing\ndomain size can be used for an accurate determination of $\\delta$.\nThe proposed method has been applied to the 2D Ising model on the\nsquare lattice providing remarkably good results. Let us note here\nthat our choice to use the 2D Ising ferromagnet as a platform\nmodel was dictated by the existence of an exact analytical result\nof the isothermal exponent, so that a direct comparison was\npossible. However, since the dynamical properties consisting the\nbackbone of the method are universal, one expects that the method\ncan be used in a wide class of spin systems to calculate the\nisothermal critical exponent in a rather straightforward manner.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nP.A.~K acknowledges financial\nsupport from the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY) Fellowships\nof Excellence for Postdoctoral Research in Greece - Siemens\nProgramme.\n\\end{acknowledgements}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{lenz} W.
