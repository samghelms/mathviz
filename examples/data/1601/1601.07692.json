with the data from STAR collaboration~\\cite{STARv1}.\nStandard JAM cascade calculation agrees with the 7.7 GeV data.\nHowever, it is seen that $v_1$ from standard JAM cascade calculations\nfor beam energies of 11.5 and 19.6 GeV yields\nmuch larger $v_1$ than the STAR data.\nThe proton slope from JAM turns to be negative at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=27$ GeV.\nThis is just because of the geometrical reason \nas pointed out in Ref.~\\cite{Snellings:1999bt},\nand is not related to the softening of the EoS.\nWe note that our results are consistent with other microscopic transport\napproaches~\\cite{Konchakovski:2014gda,Petersen:2006vm,Steinheimer:2014pfa}.\n\nBy comparison,\nattractive orbit scatterings\ndrastically reduce\nthe $v_1$ slope, and explain the STAR data\nat ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\gtrsim 10~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$ as shown\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1mid} (solid lines);\nat ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=11.5$ and $19.6$ GeV,\nthe $v_1$ slope becomes almost zero and negative, respectively.\nAt lower energy ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=7.7~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$, results with attractive orbit\nare far from the data, and there should be no EoS softening.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that the softening of the EoS affects\nthe directed flow of protons at mid-rapidity, should emerge\nat the beam energy range of\n${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\gtrsim 10~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$, but its effects should be small at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=7.7~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$.\nSince NA49 data at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=8.9$ GeV may also indicate the\nevidence of the softening of EoS~\\cite{Petersen:2006vm},\nthe onset beam energy of the softening might be lower than 10 GeV.\nTherefore, detailed experimental studies are needed \naround the beam energies of ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\lesssim 10$ GeV.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the EoS softening effects are not easy to see\nwhen the $v_1$ slope is already negative in the standard cascade.\nAs seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1mid},\nthe proton $v_1$ slope at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle

respectively.\n\nIt should be noted\nthat, however, JAM with attractive orbit overestimates\nthe negative slope of proton $v_1$ indicating the need of\nre-hardening of the EoS,\ni.e. matter created at this collision energy reaches\nwell above the transition region or weak softening\nof the EoS due to less net baryonic density.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{v1starb4.eps}\n\\caption{Same as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1mid}, but for\ncentral collisions

change of proton $v_1$ is purely geometrical\nand only happens at large impact parameters in standard\nhadronic transport models, \nit is possible to find the effects of the softening\nsharply in central collisions.\nWe show directed flows in central collisions in Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1cent}.\nSTAR data on the proton $v_1$ does not show negative slope\nfor central collisions.\nThe standard JAM cascade describes well the data both at 7.7 GeV and 27 GeV.\nWhile the hadronic description may be reasonable at 7.7 GeV,\nagreement with the data at 27 GeV\nby the hadronic model is likely to be accidental,\nsince disappearance or negative slope of $v_1$ at high energies \ncan be caused by geometrical effects.\nIn any case, 7.7 GeV and 27 GeV data do not show a hint\non the softening of the EoS within our analysis.\n\nOn the other hand,\none sees that JAM with attractive orbit \nagain quite reasonably describes the data at 11.5 and 19.6 GeV,\nwhile the standard JAM cascade overestimates the data.\nTherefore, STAR data on the proton directed flow\nfor both central and mid-central collisions\nindicate the evidence of the softening of the EoS.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{v1star11ms14.eps}\n\\caption{Directed flows of protons (left) and pions (right)\nin Au+Au collisions at mid-central collision

state.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nDetecting the QCD phase transition is of primary interest\nin current nuclear and particle physics.\nExperiments have shown that a new form of strongly interacting matter\nis created in high-energy nuclear collisions\nat the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) top energy\nand the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies~\\cite{RHIC2005}.\nTheoretical arguments and experimental signals imply \nthat this matter is a quark-gluon plasma (QGP)\ncreated well above a transition temperature\nat almost zero baryon chemical potential.\nThe lattice QCD calculations have confirmed that\nthe transition from hadronic matter to QGP\nis crossover at zero baryon density~\\cite{Aoki:2006we}.\n \nThe next challenge is to discover\nthe first and/or the second order\nphase transition of QCD matter.\nSeveral effective model and approximate calculations of QCD\nsuggest the existence of the first order phase boundary\nand the critical point\nat finite chemical potentials~\\cite{PhaseDiagram}.\n\nVarious observables, such as collective flows, particle ratios, \nmoment of the distributions of conserved charges,\nhave been measured at various incident energies \nto find evidences of a phase transition and\na critical point~\\cite{Aggarwal:2010cw,Kumar:2013cqa}.\n\n\n\nThe collective transverse flow~\\cite{Hofmann:1976dy,Stoecker:1986ci}\nhas been utilized to explore the properties of hot and dense matter,\nsince it reflects the properties of the equation of state (EoS)\nin the early stages\nof nuclear collisions~\\cite{Stoecker:2004qu,Baumgardt:1975qv}.\nThe existence of bounce off, one of the collective flows,\nin heavy-ion collisions\nwas first suggested in hydrodynamics\n~\\cite{Hofmann:1976dy,Stoecker:1986ci,Stoecker:2004qu,Baumgardt:1975qv,Flow1}\nand examined in experiments at Bevalac~\\cite{Bevalac} at LBL.\nLater, the presence of the softest point near the phase transition\nin EoS~\\cite{Hung:1994eq,Rischke:1995pe}\nhas been discussed as a signal for the first-order phase transition,\nwhere the softest point is a local minimum of\nthe ratio of pressure to energy density $p/\\epsilon$\nas a function of energy density, leading to a small sound velocity\ndefined by $v_s^2=dp/d\\epsilon$.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{Ivanov:2000dr},\nbaryon density dependence of the ratio $p/\\epsilon$\nwas investigated within a quasi-particle model.\nThe softest point of the crossover EoS at vanishing\nchemical potential is not very pronounced, but it is predicted\nthat the EoS with a first order phase transition\nexhibits a very pronounced softest point\nat large chemical potentials.\n\nConsiderations of heavy ion collisions at RHIC energy have raised the question\nwhether the physics of the often speculated\nfirst-order phase transition or the \"softest point\" should\nbetter be studied at moderate\nenergies~\\cite{Brachmann:1999xt,Stoecker:2004qu}.\nPresumably, the EoS of baryon rich matter is\nthe softest at moderate energy densities of a few GeV/fm$^3$.\n\nParticularly,\nexcitation function of directed flow slope\nwith respect to rapidity $dv_1/dy$\ndecreases at $E_\\mathrm{inc}>2 A~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$~\\cite{Liu:2000am}\nand is predicted to\nexhibit a minimum at certain collision energy in hydrodynamical\ncalculations using EoS with a first order QGP phase \ntransition~\\cite{Rischke:1995pe,Brachmann:1999xt,Ivanov:2000dr},\nwhere the $v_1$ is defined as the first Fourier component in\nthe azimuthal angle distribution with respect to the reaction plane,\n$v_1 = \\langle \\cos \\phi\\rangle$.\n\nThe negative slope of $v_1$ called\nthe third flow~\\cite{Csernai:1999nf,Csernai:2004gk}\nor the anti-flow of nucleon~\\cite{Brachmann:1999xt,Brachmann:1999mp}\nemerges as a consequence of \na tilted ellipsoid with respect to the beam axis\nfrom which negative flow build up if matter pass through\nthe softening point.\nThus the collapse of directed flow\nslope to a negative value\nmight signal the first-order phase transition\nfrom hadron phase to quark-gluon phase,\nand is recently observed in the beam energy scan (BES) program\nperformed at RHIC~\\cite{STARv1}.\n\n\nA negative slope of proton $v_1$ at mid-rapidity has been found in \nthe microscopic transport models RQMD~\\cite{Snellings:1999bt},\nUrQMD~\\cite{Bleicher:2000sx},\nand PHSD/HSD~\\cite{Konchakovski:2014gda}\nin which\nsign change is purely geometrical and only happens at large impact\nparameters and sufficiently higher collision energies.\nNote that such microscopic transport models do not show a\nnegative slope of proton $v_1$ at mid-rapidity at bombarding energies\nof ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\leq 20$ GeV\n~\\cite{Konchakovski:2014gda,Petersen:2006vm,Steinheimer:2014pfa},\nand thus the negative slope of proton $v_1$ at \n${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=11.5$ and 19.6 GeV observed\nby the STAR collaboration~\\cite{STARv1}\nis incompatible with the predictions by the standard hadronic\ntransport models.\nWe also note that hadronic transport model with momentum dependent mean field\nsignificantly improves the description of the directed flow\ndata from E895~\\cite{Liu:2000am} and NA49 data~\\cite{NA49prl,NA49prc},\nbut inclusion of the hadronic mean field does not\nlead to the negative proton $dv_1/dy$~\\cite{Isse}.\nThis gives an indirect evidence of the phase transition\naround such collision energies.\n\nThe excitation function of the directed flow slope was\ninvestigated also in\na transport + hydrodynamics hybrid approach~\\cite{Steinheimer:2014pfa},\nwhere it was\nfound that there is no sensitivity of the directed flow on the EoS,\nand there is no minimum in the excitation function\nof the directed flow slope.\nOn the contrary,\nstrong sensitivities of the directed flow to the EoS is found\nin a three-fluid model~\\cite{Ivanov:2014ioa}.\nThe three-fluid calculations indicate that crossover deconfinement\ntransition is consistent with the directed flow data\nof energy range up to ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\approx 11.5$ GeV.\nHowever, the PHSD transport model which incorporates crossover EoS\ndoes not show experimentally observed minimum~\\cite{Konchakovski:2014gda}.\nThus it is not yet clear whether the negative slope of $v_1$\nsignals the softening of EoS in hybrid approaches.\n\nAlternatively, we can\ntake into account nuclear EoS effects\nwithin a microscopic transport approach\nby changing standard stochastic two-body scattering style,\nwhich is normally implemented so as not to contribute to the pressure.\nFor example, we can\nsimulate repulsive $NN$ potential effects by allowing\nonly repulsive orbit in the two-body\ncollisions~\\cite{Halbert:1981zz,Gyulassy:1981nq,Kahana:1994be},\ninstead of choosing the scattering angle randomly\nas in a standard cascade.\nIt is reported that directed flow at Bevalac and AGS energies are well\ndescribed by this approach~\\cite{Kahana:1994be}.\nLater, attractive orbit are introduced to effectively incorporate\nthe softening of the EoS~\\cite{Sorge:1998mk}\nguided by the virial theorem~\\cite{Danielewicz:1995ay}.\nIn this way, different treatment of scatterings can modify the EoS.\n\nWe impose attractive orbit for each two-body scattering\nto reduce the pressure of the system.\n\nPressure of a system, in which particles are interacting with\neach other only by two-body scattering,\nis given by the virial theorem as~\\cite{Danielewicz:1995ay}\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n P =  P_f + \\frac{1}{3TV} \n  \\sum_{(i,j)}

directed flow of protons and pions within a microscopic\ntransport approach.\nThe transport model JAM with standard stochastic two-body\nscattering style predicts\nthe large positive slope of proton $v_1$ at the collision energy\nbelow ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=19.6$ GeV, and the negative slope of proton $v_1$\nonly at higher collision energy ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}} \\geq 27$ GeV,\nwhich disagree with the STAR data.\nWhereas,\nsoftening effects of the EoS simulated by attractive orbit scatterings\nlead to a dramatic change in the dynamics,\nand yield significant reduction of proton $v_1$ which\nwell describe the STAR data around the minimum of $dv_1/dy$\nat $10\\,\\text{GeV} \\lesssim{\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\lesssim 20$ GeV.\nThe softening effects were not needed in the present approach\nat lower energies ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=7.7~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$.\n\nOur results strongly support the conclusion that\nminimum of $dv_1/dy$ is a result of the softening of the EoS\nwhich may be caused by a first-order phase transition\n~\\cite{Stoecker:2004qu,Brachmann:1999xt,Gyulassy:1981nq,Sorge:1998mk}.\n\nA possible scenario to fully explain\nthe energy dependence of the directed flow\nmay be described as follows.\nWe assume that there exists the softest point\nin the energy density range reachable at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=11.5~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$.\nHadrons will feel attractive force\nwhen they go across the surface of the soft region.\nThis additional force can be simulated by introducing\nthe attractive orbit scatterings among hadrons, \nas we have demonstrated in the present work,\nand negative $dv_1/dy$ emerges.\nOne may need to introduce new degrees of freedom other than hadrons\nto understand the re-hardening at higher energies.\n\nIt seems obvious to infer a softening of the EoS\nfrom the experimentally observed collapse of\n net-proton flow when the c.m. energy is increased from 7 to 11 GeV.\nHowever, the statement of a discovery of the \"softening\" of the EoS from the\nnet-proton $v_1$ data shows even more convincing evidence\nfor the \"phase transition\" as we observe the re-bound at higher energies, \nnamely STAR observed second change of sign of the $v_1$\nvalues of the net-protons at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\approx 40$ GeV\nback to positive $v_1$ at higher energies~\\cite{STARv1}.\nThis shows that the soft region is overcome, \nand the directly flow picks up steam again, due to the re-hardening\nof the EoS at considerably larger energy densities.\n\nIn the near future, a more detailed analysis of the\nsoftening effect should be addressed by employing a realistic\nEoS which is consistent with the lattice QCD result.\nIt is expected that properties of the EoS at high\nbaryon density may be probed sensitively by using the flow.\nIt is also important to examine other observables\nsuch as the net-baryon number cumulants\nin the same energy range~\\cite{Adamczyk:2013dal}.\nIf the softening of EoS comes from criticality around the critical point,\ndivergence of cumulants appears as oscillating behavior\nas a result of smearing by the finite quark mass~\\cite{ScalingFn}\nor finite volume~\\cite{IMO2015}.\nThus it is an interesting question whether dynamical model calculations \nwith the EoS softening can describe the observed non-monotonic behavior\nof cumulant ratios~\\cite{Adamczyk:2013dal}.\nFuture experiments such as the BES II at RHIC~\\cite{BESII},\nFAIR~\\cite{FAIR},\nNICA~\\cite{NICA},\nand

we investigate beam energy dependence of\nthe directed flow\nwithin a microscopic transport model JAM~\\cite{JAM} by imposing\nattractive orbit for each two-body scattering\nto simulate effects of \na softening of the EoS.\nHadronic transport model JAM~\\cite{JAM}\nhas been developed\nbased on resonance and string production and their decay,\nwhich is similar to other transport\nmodels~\\cite{RQMD1995,UrQMD1,UrQMD2}.\nSecondary products from decay can interact with each other by binary collisions.\nA detailed description of the JAM model can be found in Ref.~\\cite{JAM}.\n\n\nWe now discuss directed flows in the BES energy region.\nIn the simulation, we choose the impact parameter range\n$4.6<b<9.4$ fm for mid-central \nand $0<b<4.0$ fm for central collisions\nfor the STAR data~\\cite{STARv1}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{v1starCasAorbit.eps}\n\\caption{Directed flows of\nprotons and pions in mid-central Au+Au

from\nstandard JAM cascade (dotted lines) and\nJAM cascade with attractive orbit (solid line)\nin Au+Au collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=7.7, 11.5, 19.6$ and 27 GeV\nin comparison with the data from STAR collaboration~\\cite{STARv1}.\nStandard JAM cascade calculation agrees with the 7.7 GeV data.\nHowever, it is seen that $v_1$ from standard JAM cascade calculations\nfor beam energies of 11.5 and 19.6 GeV yields\nmuch larger $v_1$ than the STAR data.\nThe proton slope from JAM turns to be negative at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=27$ GeV.\nThis is just because of the geometrical reason \nas pointed out in Ref.~\\cite{Snellings:1999bt},\nand is not related to the softening of the EoS.\nWe note that our results are consistent with other microscopic transport\napproaches~\\cite{Konchakovski:2014gda,Petersen:2006vm,Steinheimer:2014pfa}.\n\nBy comparison,\nattractive orbit scatterings\ndrastically reduce\nthe $v_1$ slope, and explain the STAR data\nat ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\gtrsim 10~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$ as shown\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1mid} (solid lines);\nat ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=11.5$ and $19.6$ GeV,\nthe $v_1$ slope becomes almost zero and negative, respectively.\nAt lower energy ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=7.7~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$, results with attractive orbit\nare far from the data, and there should be no EoS softening.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that the softening of the EoS affects\nthe directed flow of protons at mid-rapidity, should emerge\nat the beam energy range of\n${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\gtrsim 10~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$, but its effects should be small at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=7.7~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$.\nSince NA49 data at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=8.9$ GeV may also indicate the\nevidence of the softening of EoS~\\cite{Petersen:2006vm},\nthe onset beam energy of the softening might be lower than 10 GeV.\nTherefore, detailed experimental studies are needed \naround the beam energies of ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}\\lesssim 10$ GeV.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the EoS softening effects are not easy to see\nwhen the $v_1$ slope is already negative in the standard cascade.\nAs seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1mid},\nthe proton $v_1$ slope at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=27~{\\mathrm{GeV}}$ and pion $v_1$ slopes\nare negative in the standard cascade\nfrom geometrical non-QGP effects~\\cite{Snellings:1999bt}\nand from absorption by baryons~\\cite{Bass:1995pj}, respectively.\n\nIt should be noted\nthat, however, JAM with attractive orbit overestimates\nthe negative slope of proton $v_1$ indicating the need of\nre-hardening of the EoS,\ni.e. matter created at this collision energy reaches\nwell above the transition region or weak softening\nof the EoS due to less net baryonic density.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{v1starb4.eps}\n\\caption{Same as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1mid}, but for\ncentral collisions (0-10\\%).\n}\n\\label{fig:starv1cent}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe now discuss the directed flows in central collisions\nin order to distinguish the geometrical effects from phase transition.\nSince sign change of proton $v_1$ is purely geometrical\nand only happens at large impact parameters in standard\nhadronic transport models, \nit is possible to find the effects of the softening\nsharply in central collisions.\nWe show directed flows in central collisions in Fig.~\\ref{fig:starv1cent}.\nSTAR data on the proton $v_1$ does not show negative slope\nfor central collisions.\nThe standard JAM cascade describes well the data both at 7.7 GeV and 27 GeV.\nWhile the hadronic description may be reasonable at 7.7 GeV,\nagreement with the data at 27 GeV\nby the hadronic model is likely to be accidental,\nsince disappearance or negative slope of $v_1$ at high energies \ncan be caused by geometrical effects.\nIn any case, 7.7 GeV and 27 GeV data do not show a hint\non the softening of the EoS within our analysis.\n\nOn the other hand,\none sees that JAM with attractive orbit \nagain quite reasonably describes the data at 11.5 and 19.6 GeV,\nwhile the standard JAM cascade overestimates the data.\nTherefore, STAR data on the proton directed flow\nfor both central and mid-central collisions\nindicate the evidence of the softening of the EoS.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{v1star11ms14.eps}\n\\caption{Directed flows of protons (left) and pions (right)\nin Au+Au collisions at mid-central collision

the result from standard JAM/MS model,\nwhile the solid lines are for JAM/MS with attractive orbit results.\nSymbols show STAR data~\\cite{STARv1}.\n}\n\\label{fig:ms11}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIt is also necessary to examine\nthe influence of the nuclear mean-field on the\ndirected flow at mid-rapidity, since the mean-field can also modify\nthe flows.\nNuclear mean-field of hadrons are\nincluded based on the framework of simplified version of \nrelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (RQMD/S) in Ref.~\\cite{Isse}.\nDensity dependent Skyrme-type and\nmomentum dependent Yukawa potentials are employed as in Ref.~\\cite{Isse},\nbut slightly different parameter sets which \nyields the incompressibility of $K=272$ MeV~\\cite{qm15no}.\n \nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:ms11}, we show the calculated results of\nthe directed flow of\nprotons and pions at ${\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}}=11.5$ GeV\nfrom JAM with momentum dependent potentials (JAM/MS)\ntogether with the STAR data. \nMean-field slightly reduces the proton directed flow,\nbut the basic trend is the same as the JAM cascade result. \nIt is interesting to see that attractive orbit\nsupplemented by the mean-field yields negative slope,\nand provides a better description of the data than the cascade calculation\nat mid-rapidity.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbh]\n\\includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{v1evolCent.eps}\n\\caption{Time
