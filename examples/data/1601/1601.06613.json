We build up a phenomenological picture in terms of the effective dynamics of a tracer confined in a cage experiencing random hops. This minimal description exhibits scale invariance properties for the small-displacement distribution that echo experimental observations. We predict the existence of exponential tails as a cross-over between two Gaussian regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the onset of glassy behavior is controlled only by two dimensionless numbers: the number of hops occurring during the relaxation of the particle within a local cage, and the ratio of the hopping length to the cage size.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle \n\n\n\n\n\nTime-dependent density correlations in an atomic or colloidal glass former exhibit, as temperature is decreased (or as density is increased) a two step relaxation. The short time $\\beta$ relaxation is associated with localized motion of the particles while the longer time $\\alpha$ relaxation is associated with cooperatively rearranging regions (CRR). This behavior of the dynamic structure factor is well accounted for~\\cite{Biroli:11}, at sufficiently high temperatures, by the Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT)~\\cite{Gotze}. MCT being an approximate theory it does have its share of pitfalls but these are well-documented, and it is fair to say that they are not fully understood, let alone on intuitive grounds. One such predictions is the existence of a critical temperature below which the $\\alpha$-relaxation stage extends to arbitrary large times. This is often connected to the difficulty of capturing the dynamics of the CRR's, which is built from rare and intermittent events. One recent research direction has been to brute force improve the theoretical basis of the MCT, and recent promising results~\\cite{PhysRevLett.115.205701} seem to indicate that this may pay off to eliminate some of its unpleasant features. Regarding the dynamics (diffusive vs. arrested) of an individual tracer~\\cite{2015arXiv151100254P,2015arXiv151100786B} similar efforts are being made at looking beyond the existing MCT. The most recent experiments, instead of focussing on  the relaxation of collective density modes, are based on the observation of individual tracers. Tracking experiments have been  conducted by many different groups, both in actual colloidal systems~\\cite{Weeks:00,Kegel:00,Weeks:02,Kilfoil:07,Kilfoil:09,Gardel:13} as well as in silico~\\cite{Stariolo:06,Berthier:07}. The increasing accuracy of these methods allows one to measure the probability distribution function of the tracer displacement with unprecedented statistics~\\cite{Gao:09}.\n\n\nTo analyze and interpret tracking experiments, minimal phenomenological models have been developed. By using a continuous time random walk (CTRW) description, glassy systems have been studied numerically~\\cite{Farago:14a,Farago:14b}, and exact analytic results have been obtained for the Van Hove correlation function~\\cite{Berthier:07}. The CTRW considers instantaneous transitions between locally stable positions, thus decoupling the diffusion in a confined environment from the cage jumps~\\cite{Chandler:07}. Some model variations include the existence of a multiplicity of time scales in the cage dynamics~\\cite{Pastore:14,Pastore:14b,Pastore:15,Helfferich}, whereas others which include a single waiting time scale successfully reproduce many features of the dynamics of tracers in glassy systems~\\cite{Berthier:07,Berthier:08}. Despite the success of these minimal models, the existence of a scale invariant regime for the displacement distribution, as observed experimentally~\\cite{Weeks:00,Weeks:02,Kilfoil:09}, is still an open issue. The main purpose of this work is to show that this scale invariance feature can emerge from a phenomenological description.\n\n\nNote that systems other than glasses fall within the scope of our study, such as sheared fluids~\\cite{Berthier:00, Barrat:02, Berthier:02, Berthier:03}, or interacting self-propelled particles~\\cite{Stuart:13, Berthier:14, Levis:14, Rao:14, Gomper:14}. For these systems glassy behavior is generally investigated through the self-intermediate scattering function (sISF). In the case of self-propelled particles it has been observed that the onset of glassy behavior is progressively shifted when self-propulsion increases. Even though a direct extension of MCT is enough to account for this phenomenon~\\cite{Kurchan:13, Szamel:15, Brader:14}, an effective one-body dynamics that clearly determines how self propulsion affects the glassy behavior is still missing. We present here a minimal model that describes such one-body dynamics. By investigating the displacement distribution, we show that it displays scale invariance for small displacement, and we  determine how the onset of glassy behavior is linked to self propulsion. Finally, we introduce an effective mean--field potential to bridge over back to a system of interacting particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{plot_c.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:sum}\nTime-evolution of~(a) the mean-square displacement (MSD), and~(b) the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP).

The escape of the particle from the local confinement stems from structural rearrangements of the system. The activation of such sudden and irreversible reorganization can be of three types: spontaneous thermal fluctuations, external shear, or internal self-propulsion. In what follows, we refer to such a process as a directed event, by contrast to the passive diffusion of the particle within the cage.\n\n\nWe consider a particle confined within a harmonic cage of typical size ${\\sigma}$. We introduce the time scale ${\\tau_\\text{\\tiny R}}$ quantifying the time needed by the particle to explore the cage. The fluctuations of the particle in the cage are driven by a noise of amplitude $D={\\sigma}^2/{\\tau_\\text{\\tiny R}}$. To account for structural rearrangements, we assume that the central position of the cage is subjected to random shifts. This is to mimic the modification of the metastable state explored by the particle. The cage hops instantaneously by a random distance, which is exponentially distributed with a characteristic hopping length ${\\varepsilon}$. The time between two consecutive hops is also exponentially distributed, with a mean value $\\tau_0$. After a cage rearrangement, the particle relaxes towards the new cage position. We regard such relaxation as an equilibrium process. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem enforces that the relaxation time should equal the typical time of exploration  ${\\tau_\\text{\\tiny R}}$. We end up describing the one-dimensional dynamics of the particle position $x$ as\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:dyn}\n\\f{{\\text{d}} x}{{\\text{d}} t} = -\\f{x(t)-x_0(t)}{{\\tau_\\text{\\tiny R}}} + \\xi_\\text{\\tiny G}(t), \\quad \\f{{\\text{d}} x_0}{{\\text{d}} t} = {\\xi_\\text{\\tiny NG}}(t),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\f{{\\text{d}}x}{{\\text{d}}t}=-\\f{x(t)-x_{0}(t)}{{\\tau_{\\text{\\tiny R}}}}+\\xi_{%&#10;\\text{\\tiny G}}(t),\\quad\\f{{\\text{d}}x_{0}}{{\\text{d}}t}={\\xi_{\\text{\\tiny NG}%&#10;}}(t),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\f</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>d</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>d</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\f</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">R</mtext></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">G</mtext></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><mrow><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\f</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>d</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>d</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">NG</mtext></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06613.tex", "nexttext": "\nWe decouple caging and hopping dynamics, so that $\\xi_\\text{\\tiny G}$ and ${\\xi_\\text{\\tiny NG}}$ are uncorrelated processes.

The existence of directed events is quantified through the deviation from the central Gaussian, that is \\textit{via} the cross-over between the two Gaussian parts.

For the colloidal system, we reproduce the time evolution of the distribution with parameters $\\cur{\\tau_0/{\\tau_\\text{\\tiny R}}, {\\varepsilon}/\\sigma} = \\cur{25, 6}$ [Fig.~\\ref{fig:sum}(c)]. In the Lennard-Jones mixture, the measurements are taken for four temperatures at the $\\alpha$ relaxation time, corresponding to $t^*$ within our model (see below).

Available data supporting our choice of an exponential cage hop distribution however extend over a single decade, and it is likely that other choices of distribution could fit the data.\n\n\nTo further characterize  the departure from the central Gaussian, we determine the intermediate displacement part of the distribution $P_\\text{int}$ which does not include the exponential tails.

The dynamics of tracers in living systems shares common features with the glassy dynamics~\\cite{Bursac,Zhou:09}. The tracers can be either attached or embedded in a network of filaments, whose rearrangement is induced by nonequilibrium processes, thus monitoring transitions between locally stable configurations~\\cite{Weitz:09, Ahmed:15}.
