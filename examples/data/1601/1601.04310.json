Experiments and simulations reveal that fast rotation renders the flow quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D), since fast rotation suppresses the velocity gradients along the axis of rotation as shown by the Taylor-Proudman theorem \\citep{proudman16,taylor17}. \nUnder such conditions, the flow sustains inertial waves whose frequency is proportional to the rotation rate \\citep{lighthill65,greenspan68}. \n\nThe interplay between inertial waves and eddies in rotating fluids makes the problem of rotating turbulence very rich. \n\nMany experimental studies at a wide range of parameters have elucidated the dynamics of such flows \\citep{hopfingervanheijst93,ruppertetal05,davidsonetal06,bewleyetal07,vanbokhovenetal09,moisyetal11,yarometal13,campagneetal14}. Many numerical studies have also been carried out on rotating turbulence. The regime for which both the turbulence is fully developed (large Reynolds numbers) and the flow is fast rotating (small Rossby numbers) puts strong restrictions on the scale separation requirements in \nsimulations. Therefore, most of the early numerical investigations were focused on decaying rotating turbulence \\citep{bartelloetal94,hossain94,cambonetal97,morinishietal01,teitelbaummininni11,yoshimatsuetal11}.\nMore recent studies have been performed on forced rotating turbulence both at large \\citep{yeungzhou98,mininnipouquet10,mininnietal12} and small scales; the latter to study the dynamics of the inverse cascade \\citep{smithetal96,pouquetetal13,deusebioetal14}. The computational costs prevent in general the exhaustive coverage of the parameters space with most numerical studies reaching either large Reynolds numbers and moderate Rossby numbers or moderate Reynolds numbers and small Rossby numbers. \n\n\n\nNote that these simulations, with the exception of a very recent study which reached steady states and covered extensively a fairly large portion of the parameters space \\citep{alexakis15}, have not reached statistically stationary solutions \nbecause very long integration times are required.\n\nAlthough these studies were numerous and an adequate portion of the parameters space was covered there are still disparate results in different cases --- for example, different power law spectra with $E(k) \\propto k^{-5/3}$, $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-5/2}$, supported theoretically by strong and weak-wave turbulence phenomenologies \\citep{k41a,zhou95,galtier03,pouquetmininni10}. Moreover, a recent investigation showed sensitivity to forcing in that different results for the large scales of a flow that was forced at intermediate scales \\citep{senetal12} when energy was injected exclusively to the quasi-2D component of the flow and when it was injected solely to the inertial waves. The injection of helicity into the flow has also shown alterations on the behaviour of the cascade \\citep{pouquetmininni10}. Forcing dependent dynamics have been observed in various other systems such as in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence \\citep{braccowilliams10,boffettaecke12}, in beta-plane turbulence \\citep{maltrudvallis91} and in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence \\citep{da15}.\n\nThe present work focuses on the effects of the mechanical force on the dynamics of rotating flows by means of numerical simulations, varying systematically the memory time scale of the mechanical force (i.e. the time scale of which the phases of the force are randomised).\n\nThe behaviour of different mechanical forcing mechanisms on the flows is also considered for different rotation rates. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first study of forced rotating flows in the steady state regime where the effects of a large scale external force on the dynamics are studied extensively.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. All the necessary details of the formulation of our direct numerical simulations (DNS) of forced rotating turbulence are provided in Sec. \\ref{sec:dns}. Section \\ref{sec:taum} analyses the dynamics of the flows with different memory time scales of the forcing mechanism for a given Rossby number. Here, we also focus on the spontaneous emergence of helicity in our flows and its influence on the anisotropy and on the spectral dynamics. In Sec. \\ref{sec:Rossby} we describe the Rossby number dependence on flows with different type of forcing mechanisms \nand we justify the spontaneous mirror-symmetry breaking in our flows even though net helicity is not injected directly. Finally, in Sec. \\ref{sec:end}, we conclude by summarising our findings and we discuss the implications of our work.\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:dns}Numerical Simulations}\nIn this study, we consider the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating frame of reference\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n {\\partial}_t \\bm u + \\bm \\omega \\times \\bm u + 2\\bm\\Omega \\times \\bm u = - {\\bm \\nabla} P + \\nu {\\bm \\nabla}^2 \\bm u + \\bm f,\n \\label{eq:ns}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\partial}_{t}\\bm{u}+\\bm{\\omega}\\times\\bm{u}+2\\bm{\\Omega}\\times\\bm{u}=-{\\bm{%&#10;\\nabla}}P+\\nu{\\bm{\\nabla}}^{2}\\bm{u}+\\bm{f},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mo>\u2202</mo><mi>t</mi></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udf4e</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\ud835\udec0</mi></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo mathvariant=\"bold\">\u2207</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mo mathvariant=\"bold\">\u2207</mo><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>\ud835\udc87</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04310.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nFor all the runs the forcing amplitude is normalised such that $\\bm f / |\\bm f| = f_0 = 1$ and the phases $\\phi_x$, $\\phi_y$, $\\phi_z$ are randomised for the forcing wavenumbers $k_f = 2$ to 4 every $\\tau_m$, the so called memory time scale, which is one of the contol parameters in our study. In the limit of $\\tau_m \\rightarrow 0$ we have essentially a random delta correlated in time forcing with the phases randomised at each time step, whereas when we choose $\\tau_m = \\infty$ we randomise the phases only at $t=0$ in the duration of the runs and hence we apply a time-independent forcing. Note that our forcing mechanism \n\nhas $\\bm f {\\cdot} {\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f \\neq 0$ pointwise in space but it is non-helical on average ${\\langle{{\\bm f {\\cdot} {\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f}}\\rangle} = 0$.\n\nNow, if we write the wavenumbers in the 3D Fourier space using cylindrical coordinates, we have $\\bm k = (\\bm k_\\perp, \\bm k_\\parallel)$, with $k_\\perp = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$ and $k_\\parallel = |k_z|$. Then, the 2D modes \n(i.e. independent of $z$) in Fourier space can be denoted as $\\bm u(\\bm k_\\perp)$ and the 3D or wave modes as $\\bm u(\\bm k)$.

The random-in-time forcing ($\\tau_m \\rightarrow 0$) excites also the same modes but since the phases are random, this mechanism is essentially isotropic in contrast to the time-independent forcing.\n\nThe relevant dimensionless control parameters of our problem are defined based on the forcing amplitude. So, the Reynolds number is given by $Re_f = U/(k_{min}\\nu)$ and the Rossby number by $Ro_f = Uk_{min}/(2\\Omega)$ where $U = (f_0/k_{min})^{1/2}$. Using these definitions $Re_f^2$ is essentially the Grashof number and $Ro_f$ the ratio of the rotation period $\\tau_w \\propto \\Omega^{-1}$ to the eddy turnover time $\\tau_{NL} = (Uk_{min})^{-1}$.

The time-series for $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} > 4$ are characterised by large signal variations, which \nrequire extremely long time-integrations \n\nrestricting our runs to moderate Reynolds numbers. \nNote that even for low $\\tau_m$ a steady state is reached after a transient that lasts for about 50 to 100$\\tau_{NL}$ turnover times indicating how expensive computationally is to reach a steady state regime in rotating flows forced at large scales.\n\nThe temporal evolution of the energy dissipation rate $\\epsilon = \\nu{\\langle{{|\\bm \\omega|^2}}\\rangle}$ and the energy injection rate ${\\langle{{\\bm u {\\cdot} \\bm f}}\\rangle}$ are presented in Fig. \\ref{fig:injection}. For clear illustration purposes we choose to plot only the two extreme cases of the flows with the highly random-in-time forcing ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$) and the time-independent forcing ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = \\infty$) at $Ro_f = 0.1$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we saw at relatively early times the two flows reach a steady state (see Fig. \\ref{fig:energy}) and therefore the balance $\\epsilon = {\\langle{{\\bm u {\\cdot} \\bm f}}\\rangle}$ is satisfied with both flows having \nthe same rates of energy injection and dissipation. However, after a very long time period ($\\sim$ 600$\\tau_{NL}$ turnover times) the flow with the time-independent forcing deviates to \na new statistically steady state. This happens when $\\bm u$ becomes correlated with $\\bm f$ and then the flow adjusts its dissipation rate such that a new steady state is achieved. \n\nThis adjustment of the dissipation rate by the flow owing to the increase of the correlation between the external mechanical force and the velocity field explains why the energy increases as we increase the memory time scale of the forcing. This is a very interesting property of rotating flows from a practical point of view if one wants to minimise or maximise the energy dissipation rate in a potential application such as in turbomachinery. \n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:helicity}The role of helicity}\nHelicity is common in real flows and it can be created, for example, in planetary atmospheres in the presence of rotation and stratification \n\\citep{moffatt78,tobias09,marinoetal13}. In homogenenous non-rotating turbulence it is expected that the helicity spectrum cannot develop if it is initially zero \\citep{andrelesieur77} or if an external mechanism does not inject net helicity \\citep{dfa15}. In our runs zero net helicity is injected into the flow. \nNevertheless, for a given rotation rate (i.e. $Ro_f = 0.1$) we observe that the relative helicity $\\rho_H = H/(|\\bm u| |\\bm \\omega|)$ increases as the memory time scale of the forcing increases (see Fig. \\ref{fig:helicity}). \n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_vs_time_tau.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:hela}\n \\end{subfigure}\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/pdf-rhoHabs_tau.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:helb}\n \\end{subfigure}\n  \\caption{(Color online) (a) Time series of relative helicity $\\rho_H$ and (b) Probability Density Function (PDF) of the absolute value of $\\rho_H$ for the flows with different forcing memory time scale at Rossby number $Ro_f = 0.1$ and Reynolds number $Re_f = 333$}\n  \\label{fig:helicity}\n \\end{figure}\n\nIt is apparent from Fig. \\ref{fig:helicity} that the mirror-symmetry breaking depends on the value of $\\tau_m$. Figure \\ref{fig:hela} shows\n$\\rho_H$ to be almost zero at early times for all the flows and as $\\tau_m$ increases the mirror-symmetry breaks at later times only for long enough $\\tau_m$. \nWe observe that helicity \nemerges in the flow as soon as $\\tau_m$ becomes of the order of the eddy turnover time, \ni.e. $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} \\sim \\mathcal O(1)$. To analyse further this behaviour of $\\rho_H$ we plot the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the time series of the absolute value of relative helicity in Fig. \\ref{fig:helb}. This plot shows an increase in the mean value of $|\\rho_H|$ and also a broadening of the tails of the PDFs for longer memory time scales. So, unlike in homogeneous turbulence, helicity can be created in rotating flows by an external force with a sufficiently long memory time scale, even though net helicity is not injected directly into the flow.\n\nTo determine whether the breaking of mirror-symmetry, that distinguishes flows with highly random-in-time and time-independent forcings, remains at higher Reynolds numbers we carried out simulations for the two extreme cases of $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$ and $\\infty$ at $Re_f = 714$ and $Ro_f = 0.1$.\nOur numerical simulations confirm the persistence of this behaviour at higher Reynolds numbers. We therefore analyse these higher Reynolds number runs in order to gain futher insight on the effects of helicity on the flow.\n\nVisualisations of the relative helicity of the \nflows with $Re_f = 714$ are presented in Figs. \\ref{fig:vizhela} and \\ref{fig:vizhelb} with the \nvalue of $\\rho_H = -0.018$ and 0.45 for $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$ and $\\infty$, respectively. \n\nThe red and blue colour in Fig. \\ref{fig:visualisations} indicate right-hand (positive helicity) and left-hand (negative helicity) circularly polarized helical waves, respectively.\n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.35\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_tc05_007.pdf}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:vizhela}\n \\end{subfigure}\n \\hspace{1.0cm}\n\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.35\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_tcInf_030.pdf}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:vizhelb}\n \\end{subfigure}\n  \\caption{(Color online) Visualisations of the relative helicity $\\rho_H$ for the flows at Rossby number $Ro_f = 0.1$ and Reynolds number $Re_f = 714$ with (a) $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$, $\\rho_H = -0.018$ and (b) $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = \\infty$, $\\rho_H = 0.45$}\n  \\label{fig:visualisations}\n \\end{figure}\nAn instructive way to explain this further is to decompose the velocity field into circularly polarised helical waves \\citep{constantinmajda88,waleffe92}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6820, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\bm u$ is the velocity field, $\\bm \\omega = {\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm u$ is the vorticity, $P$ is the pressure, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\\bm f$ is an external mechanical force.

Then, the 2D modes \n(i.e. independent of $z$) in Fourier space can be denoted as $\\bm u(\\bm k_\\perp)$ and the 3D or wave modes as $\\bm u(\\bm k)$. Then, in this setting the time-independent forcing ($\\tau_m = \\infty$) excites two 2D modes in the $k_x$ and $k_y$ axis of the Fourier space and one 3D mode in the $k_z$ axis in the Fourier shell of amplitude $|\\bm k|=k_f$. The random-in-time forcing ($\\tau_m \\rightarrow 0$) excites also the same modes but since the phases are random, this mechanism is essentially isotropic in contrast to the time-independent forcing.\n\nThe relevant dimensionless control parameters of our problem are defined based on the forcing amplitude. So, the Reynolds number is given by $Re_f = U/(k_{min}\\nu)$ and the Rossby number by $Ro_f = Uk_{min}/(2\\Omega)$ where $U = (f_0/k_{min})^{1/2}$. Using these definitions $Re_f^2$ is essentially the Grashof number and $Ro_f$ the ratio of the rotation period $\\tau_w \\propto \\Omega^{-1}$ to the eddy turnover time $\\tau_{NL} = (Uk_{min})^{-1}$. Note that $Re_f$ and $Ro_f$ are control parameters that they do not require knowledge of the solution to be evaluated and are useful for comparison with body-forced numerical simulations or experiments. \n\n\nAll the control parameters of our DNS are listed in Table \\ref{tbl:dnsparam}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n  \\begin{center}\n\\def~{\\hphantom{0}}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l*{16}{c}}\n     $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL}$ & 0.5  & 0.5  & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 4.0 & 32.0 & 128.0 & $\\infty$ & $\\infty$ & $\\infty$ & $\\infty$ & $\\infty$ & $\\infty$ & $\\infty$ \\\\\n     $Ro_f$                         & 0.01 & 0.05 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.1  & 0.1   & 0.01     & 0.05     & 0.1      & 0.1      & 0.2      & 0.33     & 0.5      \\\\\n     $Re_f$                         & 333  & 333  & 333 & 714 & 333 & 333 & 333 & 333  & 333   & 333      & 333      & 333      & 714      & 333      & 333      & 333      \\\\\n     $\\Omega$           & 50.0 & 10.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 2.5 & 1.0 & 5.0 & 5.0  & 5.0   & 50.0     & 10.0     & 5.0      & 5.0      & 1.0      & 1.5      & 1.0      \\\\\n     $\\nu \\; (\\times 10^{-3})$             & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $1.4 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $1.4 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ & $3.0 $ \\\\\n     $N$                & 256  & 256  & 256 & 512 & 256 & 256 & 256 & 256  & 256   & 256      & 256      & 256      & 512      & 256      & 256      & 256 \\\\\n   \\end{tabular}\n  \\caption{Numerical control parameters of the DNS.} \n\n  \\label{tbl:dnsparam}\n   \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\nUsing the pseudo-spectral method, we numerically integrate Eq. \\eqref{eq:ns} in a periodic box of size $2\\pi$, satisfying the incompressibility condition ${\\bm \\nabla} {\\cdot} \\bm u = 0$.

The time-series for $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} > 4$ are characterised by large signal variations, which \nrequire extremely long time-integrations \n\nrestricting our runs to moderate Reynolds numbers. \nNote that even for low $\\tau_m$ a steady state is reached after a transient that lasts for about 50 to 100$\\tau_{NL}$ turnover times indicating how expensive computationally is to reach a steady state regime in rotating flows forced at large scales.\n\nThe temporal evolution of the energy dissipation rate $\\epsilon = \\nu{\\langle{{|\\bm \\omega|^2}}\\rangle}$ and the energy injection rate ${\\langle{{\\bm u {\\cdot} \\bm f}}\\rangle}$ are presented in Fig. \\ref{fig:injection}. For clear illustration purposes we choose to plot only the two extreme cases of the flows with the highly random-in-time forcing ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$) and the time-independent forcing ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = \\infty$) at $Ro_f = 0.1$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we saw at relatively early times the two flows reach a steady state (see Fig. \\ref{fig:energy}) and therefore the balance $\\epsilon = {\\langle{{\\bm u {\\cdot} \\bm f}}\\rangle}$ is satisfied with both flows having \nthe same rates of energy injection and dissipation. However, after a very long time period ($\\sim$ 600$\\tau_{NL}$ turnover times) the flow with the time-independent forcing deviates to \na new statistically steady state. This happens when $\\bm u$ becomes correlated with $\\bm f$ and then the flow adjusts its dissipation rate such that a new steady state is achieved. \n\nThis adjustment of the dissipation rate by the flow owing to the increase of the correlation between the external mechanical force and the velocity field explains why the energy increases as we increase the memory time scale of the forcing. This is a very interesting property of rotating flows from a practical point of view if one wants to minimise or maximise the energy dissipation rate in a potential application such as in turbomachinery. \n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:helicity}The role of helicity}\nHelicity is common in real flows and it can be created, for example, in planetary atmospheres in the presence of rotation and stratification \n\\citep{moffatt78,tobias09,marinoetal13}. In homogenenous non-rotating turbulence it is expected that the helicity spectrum cannot develop if it is initially zero \\citep{andrelesieur77} or if an external mechanism does not inject net helicity \\citep{dfa15}. In our runs zero net helicity is injected into the flow. \nNevertheless, for a given rotation rate (i.e. $Ro_f = 0.1$) we observe that the relative helicity $\\rho_H = H/(|\\bm u| |\\bm \\omega|)$ increases as the memory time scale of the forcing increases (see Fig. \\ref{fig:helicity}). \n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_vs_time_tau.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:hela}\n \\end{subfigure}\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/pdf-rhoHabs_tau.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:helb}\n \\end{subfigure}\n  \\caption{(Color online) (a) Time series of relative helicity $\\rho_H$ and (b) Probability Density Function (PDF) of the absolute value of $\\rho_H$ for the flows with different forcing memory time scale at Rossby number $Ro_f = 0.1$ and Reynolds number $Re_f = 333$}\n  \\label{fig:helicity}\n \\end{figure}\n\nIt is apparent from Fig. \\ref{fig:helicity} that the mirror-symmetry breaking depends on the value of $\\tau_m$. Figure \\ref{fig:hela} shows\n$\\rho_H$ to be almost zero at early times for all the flows and as $\\tau_m$ increases the mirror-symmetry breaks at later times only for long enough $\\tau_m$. \nWe observe that helicity \nemerges in the flow as soon as $\\tau_m$ becomes of the order of the eddy turnover time, \ni.e. $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} \\sim \\mathcal O(1)$. To analyse further this behaviour of $\\rho_H$ we plot the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the time series of the absolute value of relative helicity in Fig. \\ref{fig:helb}. This plot shows an increase in the mean value of $|\\rho_H|$ and also a broadening of the tails of the PDFs for longer memory time scales. So, unlike in homogeneous turbulence, helicity can be created in rotating flows by an external force with a sufficiently long memory time scale, even though net helicity is not injected directly into the flow.\n\nTo determine whether the breaking of mirror-symmetry, that distinguishes flows with highly random-in-time and time-independent forcings, remains at higher Reynolds numbers we carried out simulations for the two extreme cases of $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$ and $\\infty$ at $Re_f = 714$ and $Ro_f = 0.1$.\nOur numerical simulations confirm the persistence of this behaviour at higher Reynolds numbers. We therefore analyse these higher Reynolds number runs in order to gain futher insight on the effects of helicity on the flow.\n\nVisualisations of the relative helicity of the \nflows with $Re_f = 714$ are presented in Figs. \\ref{fig:vizhela} and \\ref{fig:vizhelb} with the \nvalue of $\\rho_H = -0.018$ and 0.45 for $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$ and $\\infty$, respectively. \n\nThe red and blue colour in Fig. \\ref{fig:visualisations} indicate right-hand (positive helicity) and left-hand (negative helicity) circularly polarized helical waves, respectively.\n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.35\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_tc05_007.pdf}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:vizhela}\n \\end{subfigure}\n \\hspace{1.0cm}\n\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.35\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_tcInf_030.pdf}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:vizhelb}\n \\end{subfigure}\n  \\caption{(Color online) Visualisations of the relative helicity $\\rho_H$ for the flows at Rossby number $Ro_f = 0.1$ and Reynolds number $Re_f = 714$ with (a) $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$, $\\rho_H = -0.018$ and (b) $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = \\infty$, $\\rho_H = 0.45$}\n  \\label{fig:visualisations}\n \\end{figure}\nAn instructive way to explain this further is to decompose the velocity field into circularly polarised helical waves \\citep{constantinmajda88,waleffe92}\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\bm u(\\bm x,t) = \\bm h_{\\pm}(\\bm k)e^{i(\\bm k {\\cdot} \\bm x - \\omega_{\\pm}t)},  \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\bm{u}(\\bm{x},t)=\\bm{h}_{\\pm}(\\bm{k})e^{i(\\bm{k}{\\cdot}\\bm{x}-\\omega_{\\pm}t)},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc89</mi><mo>\u00b1</mo></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>\u00b1</mo></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04310.tex", "nexttext": "\nsince $\\bm k {\\cdot} \\widehat{\\bm u}(\\bm k) = 0$.\nThen, the helicity can be separated into modes of positive and negative helicity, viz. \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 18839, "prevtext": "\nwhere $i\\bm k$, $\\bm h_+$ and $\\bm h_-$ are the linearly independent eigenvectors of the curl operator, i.e. $i\\bm k \\times \\bm h_{\\pm} = \\pm |\\bm k| \\bm h_{\\pm}$. \n\nThese complex eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other and are fully helical.

Note that the two large scale vortices are still present but this time they have the same sign of helicity on average. \nSimilar effects of helicity have also been observed on an elder study of decaying rotating turbulence \\citep{morinishietal01}.\n\nIn order to quantify the level of anisotropy of these two runs we consider the 2D energy spectrum which is defined as\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n E_{2D}(k_\\perp,k_\\parallel) = \\sum_{\\substack{k_\\parallel \\leq |\\bm k {\\cdot} \\bm e_z| < k_\\parallel+1 \\\\ k_\\perp \\leq |\\bm k \\times \\bm e_z| < k_\\perp+1}}|\\widehat{\\bm u}_{\\bm k}|^2.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"E_{2D}(k_{\\perp},k_{\\parallel})=\\sum_{\\begin{subarray}{c}k_{\\parallel}\\leq|\\bm%&#10;{k}{\\cdot}\\bm{e}_{z}|&lt;k_{\\parallel}+1\\\\&#10;k_{\\perp}\\leq|\\bm{k}\\times\\bm{e}_{z}|&lt;k_{\\perp}+1\\end{subarray}}|\\widehat{\\bm{%&#10;u}}_{\\bm{k}}|^{2}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mo>\u27c2</mo></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2225</mo></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mtable class=\"ltx_align_c\" rowspacing=\"0.0pt\"><mtr><mtd><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2225</mo></msub><mo>\u2264</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc86</mi><mi>z</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2225</mo></msub><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mo>\u27c2</mo></msub><mo>\u2264</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc86</mi><mi>z</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mo>\u27c2</mo></msub><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></munder><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04310.tex", "nexttext": "\nand the spectrum of the energy flux was obtained as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 22523, "prevtext": "\nThe sum is restricted here at energy in cylinders of radius $k_\\perp$ and energy in planes $k_\\parallel$. \nFigures \\ref{fig:2Dspeca} and \\ref{fig:2Dspecb} show the 2D energy spectrum for the flows with $\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$ and $\\infty$, respectively.

The runs that are forced with the highly random-in-time forcings have a $k^{-5/2}$ scaling. As $\\tau_m$ increases the spectra start to deviate gradually from the $k^{-5/2}$ scaling towards a $k^{-2}$ and finally reach a $k^{-5/3}$ scaling for the flow with the time-independent forcing. The $k^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum can be interpreted from the fact that the intermediate and small scales of the flow are closer to isotropy (see Figs. \\ref{fig:2Dspecb} and \\ref{fig:vizhelb}) and hence we expect the Kolmogorov phenomenology to be valid in this case. \nAll the exponents that we observe here could be related to the various phenomenologies on strong and weak-wave turbulence in the literature, where the interplay between $\\tau_{NL}$ and the time scale of the inertial waves $\\tau_w \\propto \\Omega^{-1}$ is central to obtain the different energy spectra. These spectral exponents have also been observed in other studies of forced rotating flows \\citep{yeungzhou98,mininnipouquet10,alexakis15}. So, it is clear that our results suggest a \nlack of universality in forced rotating turbulence. However, higher Reynolds number computations integrated for extremely long times are necessary to verify if this is true. \n\nThe corresponding spectra for the energy flux $\\Pi_E(k)$ normalised by the energy dissipation rate $\\epsilon_E = 2\\nu\\sum_k k^2E(k)$ are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:fluxes}. The positive flux in this plot indicates a forward cascade while the negative flux indicates a transfer of energy from the small to the large scales of the flow. In the case of negative flux we do not talk about a cascade because we do not have enough scale separation between the forcing scale and the box size. As the memory time scale of the forcing increases, the forward cascade becomes stronger. \nOn the other hand, the flux of energy towards the large scales increases as the forcing becomes more random-in-time with the flow reaching a quasi-2D state. These observations are in line with the visualisations of Fig. \\ref{fig:visualisations} which are even at higher Reynolds numbers and thus they favour the non-universal scenario.\n\nWe already saw that, as the forcing becomes less time-dependent helicity increases considerably in our flows, so these changes in the spectra can also be related to the presence of strong net helicity in the flow. This is in agreement with prior studies that have shown the influence of helicity on the energy spectrum by directly injecting helicity into the flow \\citep{mininnipouquet09,mininnipouquet10}. In contrast, helicity does not seem to have any significant effect on the spectra in non-rotating, homogeneous and isotropic helical turbulence \\citep{dfa15}.\n\nSince helicity is \nnot a sign-definite quantity and because we do not inject any net helicity, the sign of helicity in our flows undergoes changes in its inertial range. Therefore, there is either no power-law or difficult to define one in our helicity spectra. For this reason, we do not \nshow any helicity spectra here. \nIn the next section, we examine the Rossby number dependence of the dynamics of the flows.\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:Rossby}Rossby number dependence}\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:global}Global behaviour}\nIn the previous sections we saw that the dynamics depend on the nature of the forcing for a given Rossby number. Here, we investigate the effects of the rotation rate on the flows, focusing on the extreme cases of the forcing being highly random-in-time ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$) and time-independent ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = \\infty$) for fixed $Re_f = 333$. Again here we restrict ourselves to moderate Reynolds numbers because extremely long integration times for the runs with time-independent forcing are inevitable. \n\nFor high Rossby number flows the effect of rotation is negligible and the energy is expected to flow to scales smaller than the forcing scale. However, as Rossby number is decreased and the flow tends to become quasi-2D, there is more and more energy transferred to scales larger than the forcing scale due to an inverse cascade \\citep{pouquetetal13}.\n\nWe examine the energy and the relative helicity for runs with different Rossby numbers. The triangles and circles denote runs forced with a time-independent forcing and random-in-time forcing, respectively.\n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/E_vs_RoF_v3.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:Erossby}\n \\end{subfigure}\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_vs_RoF_v3.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:Hrossby}\n \\end{subfigure}\n  \\caption{(Color online) Rossby number dependence of (a) energy and (b) absolute value of relative helicity for flows with Reynolds number $Re_f = 333$.

However, the rate of increase and the values of energy for high enough rotation rates depend on the nature of the mechanical force. Note that the flow with the time-independent forcing has much more energy at small Rossby numbers.\n\nThe relative helicity behaves also very differently for the two types of flows and this is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:Hrossby}. The flow with the random-in-time forcing has zero net helicity for all $Ro_f$. However, the flow with the time-independent forcing bifurcates to a state of non-zero helicity for small enough Rossby numbers. The value of $|\\rho_H|$ seems to vary discontinuously as $Ro_f$ is decreased with the flow bifurcating to a helical state at the critical $Ro_f^{crit} \\simeq 0.2$. Thus, the transition from the non-helical to the helical state is a jump bifurcation. In summary, net helicity emerges in the flow only for small enough $Ro_f$ and long enough $\\tau_m$.\n\nHelicity is a pseudoscalar quantity and  $H \\neq 0$ only if it is directly injected into the flow (i.e. $\\bm u {\\cdot} ({\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f) \\neq 0$) by a helical mechanical force or if another pseudoscalar quantity exists related to the pseudovector ${\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f$. \nIn our work, we observe that net helicity emerges in rapidly rotating flows with long enough memory time scale forcings only. So, a pseudovector that relates the rotation vector with the forcing is $\\bm \\Omega \\times ({\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f)$ and hence the pseudoscalar quantity that will allow the generation of helicity in a rotating flow is\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 22671, "prevtext": "\nand the spectrum of the energy flux was obtained as\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n \\Pi_E(k) = \\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{k \\leq |\\bm k| < k+1} \\widehat{\\bm u}^*(\\bm k) {\\cdot} \\widehat{(\\bm u \\times \\bm \\omega)}(\\bm k).\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Pi_{E}(k)=\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\sum_{k\\leq|\\bm{k}|&lt;k+1}\\widehat{\\bm{u}}^{*}(\\bm{k}){%&#10;\\cdot}\\widehat{(\\bm{u}\\times\\bm{\\omega})}(\\bm{k}).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a0</mi><mi>E</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>K</mi></munderover><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2264</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></munder><mrow><mrow><mrow><msup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>*</mo></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u22c5</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>\ud835\udf4e</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04310.tex", "nexttext": "\nA similar expression was derived in a different way by \\cite{hide75} for a rapidly rotating flow in geostrophic balance assuming that the non-linear term is negligible.

However, as the Rossby number decreases $\\tau_w \\propto \\Omega^{-1}$ becomes the dominant timescale and then the spectrum is changed to the weak-wave turbulence prediction of $E(k) \\propto k^{-5/2}$ .\n\nSimilar behaviour is observed for the spectra of the flows with the time-independent forcing (see Fig. \\ref{fig:EspectInf}) but with two different characteristics. The first is the significant condensation of energy at large scales for small enough Rossby numbers in comparison to the flows with the random-in-time forcing. The second is the transition from the Kolmogorov-like regime with $\\tau_E \\ll \\tau_w$ to the weak-wave turbulence regime with $\\tau_w \\ll \\tau_E$, which occurs at lower Rossby numbers, showing the dependence of this transition to the nature of the mechanical force. \n\nHere, we should point out that weak-wave turbulence theory arguments, which assume uniform and isotropic forcing, predict a $k^{-5/2}$ spectrum but they do not predict condensation of energy at large scales due to an inverse cascade in unbounded domains. This is in agreement with Fig. \\ref{fig:Espect05} where there is some energy condensation at large scales but not significant in comparison to Fig. \\ref{fig:EspectInf}. \n\nHowever, the energy condensation at larges scales of Fig. \\ref{fig:EspectInf} suggests that weak-wave turbulence theory is not necessarily valid for the small Rossby number flows with time-independent forcing even though $E(k) \\propto k^{-5/2}$.\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:end}Discussion \\& conclusions}\nThe dependence of the dynamics of rotating turbulence on the nature of the large scale mechanical force is studied by means of numerical simulations to shed light on the disparate results in the literature. \nFor moderate Reynolds and low Rossby number flows we systematically vary the memory time scale $\\tau_m$ of the mechanical force. As $\\tau_m$ increases the forcing mechanism becomes less time-dependent and essentially less isotropic. \nWe are able to demonstrate that different steady state solutions will be reached if one is able to integrate for long enough time scales, showing the dependence of the flows on the forcing mechanism. When $\\tau_m \\propto \\tau_{NL}$ we observe that mirror-symmetry spontaneously breaks in the flow even though our mechanical force is non-helical. \nMoreover, as the forcing mechanism becomes less time-dependent (long $\\tau_m$) the net helicity increases. This is also true for the highest Reynolds number simulations that we carried out. We notice that helical waves break the tendency of the small and intermediate scales of the flows with the time-independent forcing to become 2D due to the imposed strong rotation. This makes the flow less anisotropic in contract to a flow with highly random-in-time forcing where the net helicity appears to be negligible. \n\nIn addition, for moderate $Re_f$ and low $Ro_f$ flows \nboth the power laws for the energy spectrum and the forward and inverse fluxes of energy \ndepend strongly on the forcing mechanism. Depending on the value of $\\tau_m$ we obtain $E(k) \\propto k^{-5/3}$, $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-5/2}$ suggesting a lack of universality in rotating turbulence. \\cite{alexakis15} showed that no matter how large the Reynolds number can be there is a small enough Rossby number such that the flow exhibits a particular behaviour (e.g. weakly rotating turbulence, quasi-2D condensates) provided that an appropriate $\\alpha>0$ is considered in the scaling $Ro_f \\propto Re_f^{-\\alpha}$ \n\n(where $\\alpha$ is expected to depend on the mechanical force).\nSo, it seems plausible \nthat forced rotating turbulent flows are non-universal. To corroborate this argument a large extent of the control parameters space should be covered with higher Reynolds number simulations integrated for extremely long times. However, this is beyond \nthe reach of current computational capabilities.\n\nThe Rossby number dependence on the dynamics of flows with a highly random-in-time and a time-independent mechanical force is also investigated at moderate Reynolds numbers. For weakly rotating turbulence (high $Ro_f$) the total energies of the two systems are comparable. Even so for small enough $Ro_f$, even though large scale vortices are present in both systems, energy condensates at large scales only for the flow with the time-independent forcing as the energy spectra demonstrate.\n\nMoreover, for large $Ro_f$ the net helicities of the two systems are zero but as $Ro_f$ becomes smaller there is a critical $Ro_f^{crit}$ which the flow with the time-independent forcing bifurcates discontinuously from a non-helical state to a helical state. On the other hand, the helicity of the flow with the random-in-time forcing remains zero for all values of $Ro_f$. \n\nBased on this observation we argue that the angle between $\\Omega\\bm e_z$ and ${\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f$ is important on the excitation of the inertial waves and concequently on the generation of net helicity in rotating flows.\nThus, a time-independent forcing adds a preferred direction of propagation to the inertial waves inducing the mirror-symmetry breaking in our flows, since this angle is fixed in time. From the other side, a highly random-in-time forcing with excites inertial waves on all directions in equal proportions and this is why the net helicity remains zero for any value of $Ro_f$. Such a mechanism has also been proposed for planetary dynamos \\citep{moffatt70}.\n\nIn the end, the lack of consistency of the results in the literature is attributed here on the forcing-depend dynamics of forced rotating turbulent flows. Experiments should be able to show if this is true at higher Reynolds and lower Rossby numbers. The spontaneous emergence of helicity in such flows is an important aspect with implications on \ncyclones persistence and intensity in supercell thunderstorms, a phenomenon which defies \nweather forecasting \\citep{markowskietal98} but also in planetary dynamos.\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nVD would like to thank A.

However, higher Reynolds number computations integrated for extremely long times are necessary to verify if this is true. \n\nThe corresponding spectra for the energy flux $\\Pi_E(k)$ normalised by the energy dissipation rate $\\epsilon_E = 2\\nu\\sum_k k^2E(k)$ are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:fluxes}. The positive flux in this plot indicates a forward cascade while the negative flux indicates a transfer of energy from the small to the large scales of the flow. In the case of negative flux we do not talk about a cascade because we do not have enough scale separation between the forcing scale and the box size. As the memory time scale of the forcing increases, the forward cascade becomes stronger. \nOn the other hand, the flux of energy towards the large scales increases as the forcing becomes more random-in-time with the flow reaching a quasi-2D state. These observations are in line with the visualisations of Fig. \\ref{fig:visualisations} which are even at higher Reynolds numbers and thus they favour the non-universal scenario.\n\nWe already saw that, as the forcing becomes less time-dependent helicity increases considerably in our flows, so these changes in the spectra can also be related to the presence of strong net helicity in the flow. This is in agreement with prior studies that have shown the influence of helicity on the energy spectrum by directly injecting helicity into the flow \\citep{mininnipouquet09,mininnipouquet10}. In contrast, helicity does not seem to have any significant effect on the spectra in non-rotating, homogeneous and isotropic helical turbulence \\citep{dfa15}.\n\nSince helicity is \nnot a sign-definite quantity and because we do not inject any net helicity, the sign of helicity in our flows undergoes changes in its inertial range. Therefore, there is either no power-law or difficult to define one in our helicity spectra. For this reason, we do not \nshow any helicity spectra here. \nIn the next section, we examine the Rossby number dependence of the dynamics of the flows.\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:Rossby}Rossby number dependence}\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:global}Global behaviour}\nIn the previous sections we saw that the dynamics depend on the nature of the forcing for a given Rossby number. Here, we investigate the effects of the rotation rate on the flows, focusing on the extreme cases of the forcing being highly random-in-time ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = 0.5$) and time-independent ($\\tau_m/\\tau_{NL} = \\infty$) for fixed $Re_f = 333$. Again here we restrict ourselves to moderate Reynolds numbers because extremely long integration times for the runs with time-independent forcing are inevitable. \n\nFor high Rossby number flows the effect of rotation is negligible and the energy is expected to flow to scales smaller than the forcing scale. However, as Rossby number is decreased and the flow tends to become quasi-2D, there is more and more energy transferred to scales larger than the forcing scale due to an inverse cascade \\citep{pouquetetal13}.\n\nWe examine the energy and the relative helicity for runs with different Rossby numbers. The triangles and circles denote runs forced with a time-independent forcing and random-in-time forcing, respectively.\n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/E_vs_RoF_v3.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:Erossby}\n \\end{subfigure}\n \\begin{subfigure}{0.49\\textwidth}\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Plots/rhoH_vs_RoF_v3.eps}\n   \\caption{}\n   \\label{fig:Hrossby}\n \\end{subfigure}\n  \\caption{(Color online) Rossby number dependence of (a) energy and (b) absolute value of relative helicity for flows with Reynolds number $Re_f = 333$.

However, the rate of increase and the values of energy for high enough rotation rates depend on the nature of the mechanical force. Note that the flow with the time-independent forcing has much more energy at small Rossby numbers.\n\nThe relative helicity behaves also very differently for the two types of flows and this is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:Hrossby}. The flow with the random-in-time forcing has zero net helicity for all $Ro_f$. However, the flow with the time-independent forcing bifurcates to a state of non-zero helicity for small enough Rossby numbers. The value of $|\\rho_H|$ seems to vary discontinuously as $Ro_f$ is decreased with the flow bifurcating to a helical state at the critical $Ro_f^{crit} \\simeq 0.2$. Thus, the transition from the non-helical to the helical state is a jump bifurcation. In summary, net helicity emerges in the flow only for small enough $Ro_f$ and long enough $\\tau_m$.\n\nHelicity is a pseudoscalar quantity and  $H \\neq 0$ only if it is directly injected into the flow (i.e. $\\bm u {\\cdot} ({\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f) \\neq 0$) by a helical mechanical force or if another pseudoscalar quantity exists related to the pseudovector ${\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f$. \nIn our work, we observe that net helicity emerges in rapidly rotating flows with long enough memory time scale forcings only. So, a pseudovector that relates the rotation vector with the forcing is $\\bm \\Omega \\times ({\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f)$ and hence the pseudoscalar quantity that will allow the generation of helicity in a rotating flow is\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n H \\propto \\bm u {\\cdot} \\bm \\Omega \\times ({\\bm \\nabla} \\times \\bm f).\n \\label{eq:helicity}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H\\propto\\bm{u}{\\cdot}\\bm{\\Omega}\\times({\\bm{\\nabla}}\\times\\bm{f}).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u221d</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc96</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>\ud835\udec0</mi></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo mathvariant=\"bold\">\u2207</mo><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>\ud835\udc87</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
