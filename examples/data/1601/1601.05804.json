We demonstrate that resonance locking between moons and internal oscillation modes of the planet can produce rapid tidal migration. Resonance locking arises due to the internal structural evolution of the planet and typically produces an outward migration rate comparable to the age of the solar system. Resonance locking predicts a similar migration timescale but a different effective tidal quality factor $Q$ for each moon. It also predicts nearly constant migration timescales a function of semi-major axis, such that effective $Q$ values were larger in the past. Recent measurements of Jupiter and Saturn's moon systems find effective $Q$ values that are smaller than expected (and are different between moons), and which correspond to migration timescales of $\\sim$10 Gyr. If confirmed, the measurements are broadly consistent with resonance locking as the dominant source of tidal dissipation in Jupiter and Saturn. Resonance locking also provides solutions to several problems posed by current measurements: it naturally explains the exceptionally small $Q$ measured for Rhea, it allows the large heating rate of Enceladus to be achieved in an equilibrium eccentricity configuration, and it resolves evolutionary problems arising from present-day migration/heating rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{keywords}\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nSatellite systems around the outer planets exhibit rich dynamics that provide clues about the formation and evolution of our solar system. The orbits of the moons evolve due to tidal interactions with their host planets, and {\\it every} moon system within our solar system shows strong evidence for significant tidal migration within the lifetime of the solar system. Yet, in many cases, the origin of tidal energy dissipation necessary to produce the observed or inferred orbital migration remains poorly understood. \n\nThe Jupiter and Saturn moon systems are particularly intriguing. In both systems, the planet spins faster than the moons orbit, such that tidal dissipation imparts angular momentum to the moons and they migrate outwards. The rich set of mean motion resonances (MMRs) between moons provide evidence for ongoing tidal migration because outward motion of inner moons produces convergent migration that allows moons to be captured into resonances (see discussion in \\citealt{dermott:88,murray:99}). For instance, the 4:2:1 resonance of the orbits of Io:Europa:Ganymede indicates that Io has tidally migrated outwards by a significant fraction of its current semi-major axis, catching both Europa and Ganymede into MMRs during the process.\n\nThe tidal energy dissipation responsible for outward migration is often parameterized by a tidal quality factor $Q$ \\citep{goldreich:66} that is difficult to calculate from first principles. Smaller values of $Q$ correspond to larger energy dissipation rates and shorter migration timescales. The actual value of $Q$ can be somewhat constrained by observed orbital architectures: very small values of $Q$ are implausible because they would imply the satellites formed inside their Roche radii, whereas very large values of $Q$ are unlikely because they would not allow for capture into MMRs within the lifetime of the solar system. In other words, the current orbital architectures mandate that outward migration timescales are within an order of magnitude of the age of the solar system. This simple fact creates a fine-tuning problem for standard tidal theories, where the $Q$ of the planet is set by its internal properties and should not preferentially create an orbital migration time scale comparable to the age of the solar system.\n\n\n\n\nIn classical tidal theory, tidal energy dissipation occurs via the frictional damping of the equilibrium tide, which is defined as the tidal distortion that would be created by a stationary perturbing body. In this case, damping can arise from turbulent viscosity due to convective motions in a gaseous envelope \\citep{goldreich:77} or by viscoelasticity in a solid core (\\citealt{dermott:79,remus:12a,remus:12b,storch:14,remus:15}). However, tidal dissipation can also occur through the action of dynamical tides, which arise due to the excitation of waves and/or oscillation modes by the time-dependent gravitational force of the perturbing body. The dynamical tide may be composed of traveling gravity waves (e.g., \\citealt{zahn:75,ioannou:93a,ioannou:93b}), tidally excited gravity modes (e.g., \\citealt{lai:97,fuller:12b,burkart:12}, or tidally excited inertial modes/waves (e.g., \\citealt{wu:05a,wu:05b,ogilvie:04,ogilvie:13,guenel:14,braviner:15,auclair:15,mathis:15}).\n\n\nThe notable feature of many previous works is that they struggle to produce tidal dissipation rates large enough to match those inferred for Jupiter and Saturn, given plausible internal structures of the planets. Models involving viscoelastic dissipation in the core or inertial waves in the envelope require the presence of a large core (solid in the former case, and either solid or more dense in the latter case) in order to produce significant energy dissipation. Although substantial cores likely do exist \\citep{guillot:14}, water ice in giant planet cores is likely to be liquid \\citep{wilson:12b}, and rocky materials (silicon and magnesium oxides) could be liquid or solid \\citep{mazevet:15}. In both cases, the ice/rock is likely to be soluble in the surrounding hydrogen/helium \\cite{wilson:12a}, and the cores may have substantially eroded (thereby erasing sharp density jumps) over the life of the solar system.  Moreover, viscoelastic models generally contain two free parameters (a core shear modulus and viscosity) which must be appropriately tuned in order to yield a tidal $Q$ compatible with constraints. \n\nUsing remarkable astrometric observations spanning many decades, several recent works \\citep{lainey:09,lainey:12,lainey:15} have provided the first (albeit uncertain) measurements of the outward migration rates of a few moons in the Jupiter and Saturn systems. These measurements indicate that current outward migration rates are much faster than predicted.  In fact, for a constant tidal $Q$, the current migration rates are incompatible with the contemporaneous formation of the moons and the planets, because the moons would have already migrated beyond their current positions over the lifetime of the solar system. The measurements also indicate that the effective tidal $Q$ is different for each moon, which cannot be explained by equilibrium tidal models that predict a nearly constant $Q$. \n\n\nIn this work, we examine a mechanism known as resonance locking \\citep{witte:99}, originally developed in stellar contexts, which produces accelerated orbital migration via dynamical tides. Previous planetary studies have neglected the fact that the internal structures of planets may evolve on timescales comparable to their age. Such structural evolution causes planetary oscillation mode frequencies to gradually change, allowing for resonance locking to occur. During a resonance lock, a planetary oscillation mode stays nearly resonant with the forcing produced by a moon, greatly enhancing tidal dissipation and naturally producing outward migration on a timescale comparable to the age of the solar system. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of resonance locking in giant planet moon systems, finding that resonance locking is likely to occur and can resolve many of the problems discussed above. Although there are substantial uncertainties in the planetary structure, evolution, and oscillation mode spectra of giant planets, resonance locking is insensitive to many of these details and yields robust predictions for outward moon migration on planetary evolution timescales.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section \\ref{res}, we discuss tidal dissipation via resonances with oscillation modes and the process of resonance locking. Section \\ref{orb} investigates orbital migration and MMRs resulting from resonance locking. We compare our theory with observations of the Jupiter and Saturn moon systems in Section \\ref{jupsat}. Section \\ref{discussion} provides discussion of our results, including implications for tidal heating and the orbital evolution of the moons. We summarize our findings in Section \\ref{conclusions}. Details related to planetary oscillation modes, their ability to sustain resonance locks, and tidal heating can be found in the appendices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Tidal Migration via Resonances}\n\\label{res}\n\n\\subsection{Basic Idea}\n\nTidal dissipation and outward orbital migration of moons can be greatly enhanced by resonances between tidal forcing frequencies and discrete ``mode frequencies\" associated with enhanced tidal dissipation. The mode frequencies may occur at gravity/inertial/Rossby mode frequencies, or they could correspond to frequencies at which inertial waves are focused onto attractors to create enhanced tidal dissipation \\citep{ogilvie:04,ogilvie:07,goodman:09,ogilvie:12,auclair:15}. For the discussion that follows, the important characteristics of the mode frequencies are \\\\\n1. The tidal energy dissipation rate at the mode frequencies is much larger than the surrounding ``continuum\" dissipation rate.\\\\\n2. The mode frequencies occupy narrow ranges in frequency space, i.e, adjacent resonances do not overlap. \\\\\n3. The mode frequencies are determined by the internal structure of the tidally forced body and may evolve with time.\\\\\n\nThe outer layers of Jupiter and Saturn are composed of thick convective envelopes. These envelopes may allow for a dense spectrum of mode frequencies at which tidal dissipation is greatly enhanced by the action of inertial waves \\citep{ogilvie:04}. For Saturn, recent observations of its rings \\citep{hedman:13,hedman:14} have provided evidence that stable stratification exists deep within Saturn's interior \\cite{fuller:14}. Stable stratification (or semi-convective layers) has also been advocated to exist based on Saturn's thermal evolution \\citep{leconte:12,leconte:13}. Both stably stratified layers and semi-convective layers support gravity modes (g modes, see \\citealt{belyaev:15}) that can enhance tidal dissipation.\n\nTo demonstrate the importance of resonances with mode frequencies, we calculate the frequencies and eigenfunctions of the g modes and fundamental modes (f modes) of the Saturn model presented in \\cite{fuller:14}. We describe this process in more detail in Appendix \\ref{modes}. We also calculate an approximate damping rate of each mode due to the turbulent viscosity acting within the convective envelope. Next, we calculate the energy dissipation rate due to the tidal excitation and turbulent damping of the modes. The efficiency of tidal dissipation can be expressed through the tidal migration timescale\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ttide}\nt_{\\rm tide} = - \\frac{E_{\\rm orb}}{\\dot{E}_{\\rm tide}} = \\frac{a}{\\dot{a}_{\\rm tide}} \\, ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"t_{\\rm tide}=-\\frac{E_{\\rm orb}}{\\dot{E}_{\\rm tide}}=\\frac{a}{\\dot{a}_{\\rm tide%&#10;}}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>tide</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>orb</mi></msub><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>E</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mi>tide</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mi>a</mi><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>a</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mi>tide</mi></msub></mfrac></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05804.tex", "nexttext": "\nHere, $R_{\\rm p}$ is radius of the planet, $k_2$ is its Love number, and $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ is the moon's angular orbital frequency. \n\nFigure \\ref{SatQmodes} shows the values of $Q$ and $t_{\\rm tide}$ as a function of semi-major axis due to tidal dissipation via oscillation modes of our Saturn model.

During resonance locking, the coupled evolution of the mode frequency and the orbital frequency of the perturbing body proceeds such that the perturber remains near resonance with the oscillation mode. \n\nThe dynamics of resonance locking can be qualitatively understood from the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{SatQmodes}. Consider a moon located at the stable fixed point, where its outward migration timescale is equal to that at which the resonant location moves outward. If its orbit is perturbed inward (toward resonance) tidal dissipation will increase, and the moon will be pushed back outward toward the fixed point. If the moon's orbit is perturbed outward (away from resonance) the moon's outward migration rate will decrease,\n\nand the resonant location will move outward and catch up with the moon.

The green points are the measurements of \\citealt{lainey:15}. The blue boxes are the predicted values of $Q$ for $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ and $t_{\\rm p} = \\infty$ in the resonance locking theory. For Mimas, the lower bound on the predicted $Q_{\\rm ResLock}$ is that required to maintain the resonance lock and push out Tethys, assuming all the tidal dissipation within Saturn is produced by a resonance lock with Mimas (equation \\ref{q2}). The upper bound on $Q_{\\rm ResLock}$ for Mimas is that required to maintain the resonance lock, but with Tethys migrating outward due to its own tides (equation \\ref{q}). For Tethys, the lower bound in $Q_{\\rm ResLock}$ is the minimum value of $Q$ such that it remains in mean motion resonance with Mimas (equation \\ref{q122}). There is no upper bound to $Q$ for Tethys because it may be pushed outwards solely by Mimas. The Enceladus-Dione system behaves similarly. Rhea is not in a mean motion resonance, allowing for a precise prediction. {\\bf Bottom:} Corresponding outward migration time scale $t_{\\rm tide}$. The observed values of $t_{\\rm tide}$ are calculated from equation \\ref{qdef} using the measured values of $Q$ and do not take MMRs into account (see text). The data is consistent with $t_{\\rm tide} \\approx 10 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ for all moons.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nWe now apply our theories to the Jovian and Saturnian moon systems, and compare with the recent measurements of $Q$ from \\cite{lainey:09,lainey:12,lainey:15}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Saturn}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure \\ref{SatQ} shows the effective values of $Q$ measured by \\cite{lainey:15} for the tidal interaction between Saturn and its inner moons. Although the measured value of $Q$ is similar for Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione, it is roughly one order of magnitude smaller for Rhea. The much smaller $Q$ for Rhea cannot be explained by any model of equilibrium tidal energy dissipation, and can only be accounted for by models including dynamical tides. Interestingly, the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{SatQ} shows that the corresponding outward migration timescale is similar for each moon, with $t_{\\rm tide} \\sim 10 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$.\n\nWe have computed the measured values of $t_{\\rm tide}$ from the measured values of $Q$ using equation \\ref{qdef}. This equation does not take MMRs into account, which can change the actual migration timescale. For Enceladus, the measured value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ should be regarded as a lower limit, since its migration may be slowed by outer moons. For Tethys and Dione, the value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ is an upper limit, since they may be pushed outward by inner moons. Unfortunately, all of these timescales are dependent on one another. They also depend on inward migration rates due to eccentricity damping, which in turn depend on the values of $k_2$ and $Q$ for tidal effects within each moon, which are not constrained by \\cite{lainey:15}. \n\nWith these complications in mind, we also plot in Figure \\ref{SatQ} the values $Q$ and $t_{\\rm tide}$ expected for the resonance locking scenario. We have set $t_{\\rm \\alpha} = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ in equation \\ref{q} such that the value of $Q$ from resonance locking roughly matches the observed value for Rhea, which offers the best chance for comparison due to its lack of MMRs. For simplicity, we adopt the limit of no planetary spin-up, $t_{\\rm p}\\rightarrow\\infty$. The remarkable result of this exercise is that resonance locking naturally produces a very low effective $Q$ for Rhea even for a realistic (and perhaps somewhat slow, $t_{\\rm \\alpha} \\sim 10 \\, T_\\odot$) mode evolution rate. \n\nThe predicted values of $Q$ and $t_{\\rm tide}$ from resonance locking for the inner moons (Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione) are similar to but slightly larger than the measurements of \\cite{lainey:15}. The predicted values for Tethys are most discrepant, and are incompatible with the value $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ that fits for Rhea. This may indicate that the inner moons migrate outward due to viscoelastic dissipation in the core as advocated in \\cite{lainey:15}. However, the fact that $t_{\\rm tide} \\! \\sim \\! 10 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ for each of these moons indicates that dynamical tides and/or resonance locking could still be occurring. Since $t_\\alpha$ is not expected to be the same for each oscillation mode, it is possible that the effective $t_\\alpha$ driving resonance locking of the innermost moons is smaller by a factor of a few compared to the best fit value for Rhea.\n\nWe caution that the MMRs between these moons may complicate both the measurements and their interpretation. For instance, the eccentricity of Enceladus is excited by the MMR with Dione, allowing inward migration due to tidal dissipation within Enceladus. The current outward migration of both Enceladus and Dione may not represent an equilibrium or time-averaged migration rate (see e.g., \\citealt{meyer:07}), depending on the dynamics of tidal dissipation within Enceladus. Moreover, the measured values of $Q$ in \\cite{lainey:15} for Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione were all dependent on the dissipation within Enceladus, and so we believe these measurements should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, the migration of Tethys is affected by its MMR with Mimas, for which the outward migration was not constrained by \\cite{lainey:15}, and which may influence the measured value of $Q$ for the other moons. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Jupiter}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.44]{JupQ.pdf}\n\\end{center} \n\\caption{ \\label{JupQ} \n{\\bf Top:} Effective tidal quality factors $Q$ for the inner moons of Jupiter. The green point is the measurement of \\citealt{lainey:09}. The blue boxes are the predicted values of $Q$ using the same $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ as in Saturn (see Figure \\ref{SatQ}). {\\bf Bottom:} Corresponding outward migration time scale $t_{\\rm tide}$. Observed points are taken from \\citealt{lainey:09}, where the measured inward migration of Io has $t_{\\rm tide} \\! < \\! 0$ and is not shown. We also plot the calculated outward migration timescale of the Io:Europa:Ganymede chain from the measured value of $Q$ for the Io-Jupiter interaction, assuming zero tidal dissipation produced by Europa and Ganymede.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nFigure \\ref{JupQ} shows the predicted and measured \\citep{lainey:09} values of $Q$ and $t_{\\rm tide}$ for the moons of Jupiter. We have again used $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$, although the appropriate value of $t_\\alpha$ could be different for Jupiter. The measured $t_{\\rm tide}$ for Io was negative, with the interpretation that the instantaneous migration of Io is inward due to eccentricity damping. This point does not appear on the plot, and likely does not represent the long-term migration rate of Io. We have also plotted a value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ calculated from the measured $Q$ for Io, by assuming it drives the migration of Europa and Ganymede in the current MMR. We caution against making a very thorough comparison with the data, as it is unclear whether the measured value of $Q$ for Io will be modified with updated measurements, as was the case in the Saturnian system.\n\nNonetheless, we note that our predicted $Q$ for Io falls very close to the measured value, especially if we take the lower bound on the predicted $Q$ corresponding to Io driving the outward migration of Europa and Ganymede. This correspondence can also be seen by the proximity of the predicted value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ with the calculated $t_{\\rm tide}$ which may more accurately characterize the long-term migration than the instantaneous observed $t_{\\rm tide}$. This entails an outward migration timescale of $t_{\\rm tide} \\sim 20 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. In this case, we expect the effective tidal $Q$ for tidal dissipation in Jupiter caused by Europa to be quite large, $Q \\! \\gtrsim \\! 10^4$, although we expect Europa to be migrating outward at $t_{\\rm tide} \\sim 20 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ due to its MMR with Io.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{discussion}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Relation with Previous Tidal Theories}\n\nThe measurements of \\cite{lainey:15} clearly rule out the common assumption of a constant value of $Q$ governing the outward tidal migration of Saturn's moons. The majority of previous literature investigating the subject assumed a constant $Q$, and must now be interpreted with caution.\n\nSeveral works (e.g., \\citealt{remus:12a,guenel:14,lainey:15}) have sought to explain the tidal $Q\\sim 2000$ measured for Enceladus, Tethys and Rhea via viscoelastic dissipation within a solid core. However, this conclusion generates problems for the orbital evolution of the moons (see Section \\ref{orbits}), forcing one to accept that the moons formed billions of years after the rest of the solar system, or that $Q$ was much larger (for no obvious reason) in the past. Additionally, these theories cannot explain the small $Q$ of Rhea.\n\nResonance locking can resolve many of these puzzles. It accounts for varying values of $Q$ by positing a nearly constant value of $t_\\alpha$ which governs the value of $Q$ through equation \\ref{q}. Unlike the value of $Q$ in equilibrium tidal theory that can be very difficult to compute from first principles (and frequently yields predictions orders of magnitude too large), the value of $t_\\alpha$ can be calculated based on a thermal evolution model of a planet. The natural expectation is that $t_\\alpha$ is comparable to the age of the solar system, yielding outward migration timescales of similar magnitude, as observed. \n\nAlthough other dynamical tidal theories (e.g., \\citealt{ogilvie:04,ogilvie:12,auclair:15}) can produce low and varying values of $Q$, they suffer from two problems. First, the widths of the resonances at which strong tidal dissipation occurs are somewhat narrow (especially for small core radii), and it is not clear whether we expect to find any moons within these resonances. Second, at an arbitrary orbital frequency there is no reason to expect $t_{\\rm tide}$ to be comparable to the age of the solar system. Resonance locking solves both these problems because moons can get caught in resonance locks that could last for billions of years, making it likely to observe a moon in a state of large tidal dissipation. Moreover, the value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ is naturally expected to be comparable to the age of the solar system.\n\nOur purpose here is not at all to dismiss tidal theories based on dissipation of inertial waves. Instead, we advocate that these theories naturally reproduce the observations only if planetary evolution is included in the long-term behavior of the system. The evolution of the planet causes the locations of tidal resonances to migrate, allowing for resonance locks with the moons such that they migrate at a similar rate. In this picture, the precise frequencies and strengths of tidal resonances with inertial waves or g modes is not important, nor is their frequency-averaged dissipation rate. All that matters is the mere existence of such resonances, and the rate at which these resonant frequencies evolve (see equation \\ref{ttidein}). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Evolutionary Timescales}\n\\label{timescale}\n\nIn the resonance locking scenario, the outward migration timescale of moons is set by the planetary evolution timescale $t_{\\alpha}$ in equation \\ref{omalphadot}. Predicting this timescale is not simple, as it depends on internal structural evolution timescales, which are poorly constrained. However, we can place some rough constraints. First, we expect $t_\\alpha$ to be comparable to or longer than the age of the solar system $T_{\\odot}$. Any process that occurs on a shorter timescale has already occurred, or has slowed down to timescales of $\\sim \\! T_{\\odot}$. \n\nSecond, we can estimate an upper limit from the planet's thermal emission, which is generated through the release of gravitational energy.

Although the measured value of $Q$ is similar for Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione, it is roughly one order of magnitude smaller for Rhea. The much smaller $Q$ for Rhea cannot be explained by any model of equilibrium tidal energy dissipation, and can only be accounted for by models including dynamical tides. Interestingly, the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{SatQ} shows that the corresponding outward migration timescale is similar for each moon, with $t_{\\rm tide} \\sim 10 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$.\n\nWe have computed the measured values of $t_{\\rm tide}$ from the measured values of $Q$ using equation \\ref{qdef}. This equation does not take MMRs into account, which can change the actual migration timescale. For Enceladus, the measured value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ should be regarded as a lower limit, since its migration may be slowed by outer moons. For Tethys and Dione, the value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ is an upper limit, since they may be pushed outward by inner moons. Unfortunately, all of these timescales are dependent on one another. They also depend on inward migration rates due to eccentricity damping, which in turn depend on the values of $k_2$ and $Q$ for tidal effects within each moon, which are not constrained by \\cite{lainey:15}. \n\nWith these complications in mind, we also plot in Figure \\ref{SatQ} the values $Q$ and $t_{\\rm tide}$ expected for the resonance locking scenario. We have set $t_{\\rm \\alpha} = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ in equation \\ref{q} such that the value of $Q$ from resonance locking roughly matches the observed value for Rhea, which offers the best chance for comparison due to its lack of MMRs. For simplicity, we adopt the limit of no planetary spin-up, $t_{\\rm p}\\rightarrow\\infty$. The remarkable result of this exercise is that resonance locking naturally produces a very low effective $Q$ for Rhea even for a realistic (and perhaps somewhat slow, $t_{\\rm \\alpha} \\sim 10 \\, T_\\odot$) mode evolution rate. \n\nThe predicted values of $Q$ and $t_{\\rm tide}$ from resonance locking for the inner moons (Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione) are similar to but slightly larger than the measurements of \\cite{lainey:15}. The predicted values for Tethys are most discrepant, and are incompatible with the value $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ that fits for Rhea. This may indicate that the inner moons migrate outward due to viscoelastic dissipation in the core as advocated in \\cite{lainey:15}. However, the fact that $t_{\\rm tide} \\! \\sim \\! 10 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$ for each of these moons indicates that dynamical tides and/or resonance locking could still be occurring. Since $t_\\alpha$ is not expected to be the same for each oscillation mode, it is possible that the effective $t_\\alpha$ driving resonance locking of the innermost moons is smaller by a factor of a few compared to the best fit value for Rhea.\n\nWe caution that the MMRs between these moons may complicate both the measurements and their interpretation. For instance, the eccentricity of Enceladus is excited by the MMR with Dione, allowing inward migration due to tidal dissipation within Enceladus. The current outward migration of both Enceladus and Dione may not represent an equilibrium or time-averaged migration rate (see e.g., \\citealt{meyer:07}), depending on the dynamics of tidal dissipation within Enceladus. Moreover, the measured values of $Q$ in \\cite{lainey:15} for Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione were all dependent on the dissipation within Enceladus, and so we believe these measurements should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, the migration of Tethys is affected by its MMR with Mimas, for which the outward migration was not constrained by \\cite{lainey:15}, and which may influence the measured value of $Q$ for the other moons. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Jupiter}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.44]{JupQ.pdf}\n\\end{center} \n\\caption{ \\label{JupQ} \n{\\bf Top:} Effective tidal quality factors $Q$ for the inner moons of Jupiter.

We have again used $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$, although the appropriate value of $t_\\alpha$ could be different for Jupiter. The measured $t_{\\rm tide}$ for Io was negative, with the interpretation that the instantaneous migration of Io is inward due to eccentricity damping. This point does not appear on the plot, and likely does not represent the long-term migration rate of Io. We have also plotted a value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ calculated from the measured $Q$ for Io, by assuming it drives the migration of Europa and Ganymede in the current MMR. We caution against making a very thorough comparison with the data, as it is unclear whether the measured value of $Q$ for Io will be modified with updated measurements, as was the case in the Saturnian system.\n\nNonetheless, we note that our predicted $Q$ for Io falls very close to the measured value, especially if we take the lower bound on the predicted $Q$ corresponding to Io driving the outward migration of Europa and Ganymede. This correspondence can also be seen by the proximity of the predicted value of $t_{\\rm tide}$ with the calculated $t_{\\rm tide}$ which may more accurately characterize the long-term migration than the instantaneous observed $t_{\\rm tide}$.

For the g mode resonances shown in Figure \\ref{SatQmodes}, the modes are linear in the sense that fluid displacements are orders of magnitude smaller than their wavelengths. Resonant saturation could occur if the mode damping rates are a few orders of magnitude larger than those calculated in Appendix \\ref{damp}.

For a constant $Q$, the tidal migration timescale for a moon of a given mass is a very strong function of semi-major axis (see Figure \\ref{SatQmodes}), such that $t_{\\rm tide} \\propto a^{13/2}$ (see equation \\ref{qdef}). This has created problems for conventional tidal theories, because it implies that outward migration rates were much faster in the past, thereby requiring large values of $Q$ (and correspondingly slow present-day outward migration) in order for the moons to have migrated to their current positions if they formed coevally with Saturn. However, the measured values of $Q$ are much smaller than the lower limits described by \\cite{peale:80}, implying such rapid past migration (in a constant $Q$ scenario) that the moons could not have formed at the same time as Saturn. Studies which have assumed constant values of $Q$ for Saturn in order to constrain the orbital evolution history (e.g., \\citealt{peale:80,meyer:07,meyer:08,zhang:09}) should be interpreted with caution.\n\nFigure \\ref{SatQevol} demonstrates the qualitative nature of orbital evolution assuming the effective value of $Q$ measured by \\cite{lainey:15} is constant in time. Here, we have integrated equation \\ref{qdef} backward in time for each moon, finding that the orbital semi-major axis decreases to zero in less than the age of the solar system. In other words, the moons must have formed billions of years after Saturn to be compatible with the theory of a constant tidal $Q$. Although this scenario has been proposed \\citep{charnoz:11,crida:12,asphaug:13}, we find the resonance locking solution described below to be simpler. \n\nIn contrast to constant tidal $Q$ models, resonance locking predicts that $t_{\\rm tide}$ {\\it increases} at small orbital distances (see equation \\ref{ttiderl}) where orbital frequencies are higher, for a constant value of $t_\\alpha$. The corresponding values of $Q$ (see equation \\ref{qdef}) are much larger because of the $Q \\propto a^{-13/2}$ scaling for a constant $t_{\\rm tide}$. Hence, the effective values of $Q$ for the moons were likely much larger in the past than they are at present, resolving the incompatibility of the small measured values of $Q$ with the age of the solar system. This is demonstrated in Figure \\ref{SatQevol}, where we integrate equation \\ref{ttiderl} backward in time for each moon, using $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$. We caution that the value of $t_\\alpha$ may also have been smaller in the past, somewhat offsetting the orbital frequency dependence of equation \\ref{ttiderl}, and a detailed orbital evolution should take both these effects into account. \n\n\nNote also that resonance locking entails the effective values of $Q$ may vary by orders of magnitude over time, depending on whether a given moon is in a resonance lock. Each moon may have spent large amounts of time not involved in resonance locks and migrating outwards on long timescales, until eventually encountering a resonance and migrating outwards more rapidly (or being pushed outward by a MMR). \n\nA potential problem with resonance locking is that it does not always guarantee convergent orbital migration for two moons. For a constant $t_\\alpha$, equation \\ref{ttiderl} implies a shorter migration timescale for outer moons. If two moons are both caught in a resonance lock with the same $t_\\alpha$, the inner moon will not catch up to the outer moon to establish a MMR. Similarly, if an outer moon is pushed outward by a MMR such that it passes through a mode resonance, it could lock into resonance with the mode and escape the MMR. This could explain how Rhea was able to escape MMRs with other inner moons of Saturn; it simply migrated outward faster. However, the observed MMRs of inner moons require explanation. It is not expected that $t_\\alpha$ is exactly the same for all modes, and it is possible that some inner moons have locked into resonance with modes with low values of $t_\\alpha$ such that they migrate out faster. Since the mode density of our model is higher near inner moons (see Figure \\ref{SatQmodes}), the inner moons may have had more chances to lock with low $t_\\alpha$ modes. A more detailed planetary thermal evolution model would be required to investigate this possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Tidal Heating}\n\nIn Appendix \\ref{heat}, we calculate the tidal heating of moons implied by resonance locking. As in conventional tidal theories, the outward migration does not induce tidal heating in a moon unless the moon's eccentricity is increased due to a MMR, leading to heat deposition by eccentricity tides. In this case, the equilibrium tidal heating rate of the inner moon (assuming no tidal migration of the outer moon) is\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 42366, "prevtext": "\nTherefore, we expect the frequencies of oscillation modes in Saturn to be changing on timescales $4.5 \\, {\\rm Gyr} \\lesssim t_{\\alpha} \\lesssim 100 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$.

A future measurement of such a low $Q$ driving Titan or Callisto's migration would be strong evidence for resonance locking. In this case, these moons may have migrated outward by a significant fraction of their current semi-major axis during the lifetime of the solar system. This migration may have caused Titan to pass through MMR's that excited its eccentricity to its current level \\citep{cuk:13}.\n\nAlthough resonance locking could have occurred for Titan or Callisto in the past, these moons may not currently be in resonance locks. The required mode amplitudes may not be achievable (larger amplitudes are required for moons of larger mass and semi-major axis) due to non-linear effects or resonance saturation.\n\nIt is possible that Titan or Callisto were previously in resonance locks, which eventually broke due to the increasingly short migration timescales (and correspondingly large required mode amplitudes) as their orbital frequencies decreased (see equation \\ref{ttiderl}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{conclusions}\n\n\nWe have proposed that a resonance locking process accounts for the rapid outward migration of some of the inner moons of Jupiter and Saturn. During a resonance lock, the outward migration rate is greatly enhanced due to a resonance between the moon's tidal forcing frequency and an oscillation mode of the planet. The oscillation mode could correspond to a gravity mode, or a frequency of enhanced energy dissipation via inertial waves. In either case, the frequency of these oscillation modes change as the planets cool and their internal structures evolve. When a mode frequency crosses a forcing frequency, the moon can be caught in a resonance lock and then migrates outward at a rate comparable to the planet's evolutionary timescale, set by equation \\ref{adot}. In some respects, the dynamics of resonance locking is similar to locking into mean motion resonances during convergent orbital migration. \n\nResonance locking can only explain the outward migration of Jupiter and Saturn's moons if mode frequencies increase in the rotating frame of the planet, such that their resonant locations move outward (away from the planet), and moons can ``surf\" the resonances outward. This will likely be the case for g modes, but the picture is less clear for inertial waves (see Section \\ref{inertial}). The occurrence of resonance locking is only weakly dependent on exact mode damping rates and their gravitational coupling with moons, which we find to be amenable to resonance locking (see Appendix \\ref{resonancelocks}). Once a resonance lock with a moon is established, the moon's migration rate is determined purely by the outward migration of the resonant location, and is not dependent on the details of the planetary structure, mode frequencies, damping rates, or eigenfunctions (see equation \\ref{ttidein}).\n\nResonance locking predicts an outward migration timescale of order the age of the solar system, as suggested by observations of the Saturn and Jupiter systems (see Figures \\ref{SatQ} and \\ref{JupQ}, \\citealt{lainey:09,lainey:12,lainey:15}). In other words, resonance locking typically predicts low effective tidal quality factors $Q$ for moons caught in resonance locks. Resonance locking also predicts different values of $Q$ for different moons (via equation \\ref{q}), and naturally accounts for the very small value of $Q$ measured for Rhea. In the resonance locking paradigm, the outward migration rate $t_{\\rm tide}$ is roughly constant for each moon (with some variation, see equation \\ref{ttiderl}), rather than the value of $Q$ being constant.\n\nSimilarly, resonance locking can account for the large observed heating rates of Io and Enceladus. These high heating rates arise from the short outward migration timescale (and low effective value of $Q$) resulting from resonance locking (equation \\ref{eheateq}). Cyclic heating events need not be invoked (except perhaps mild cyclic variation for Io) to account for the current heating, although of course it remains possible that heating cycles do occur.\n\nFinally, resonance locking resolves the problems arising from current-day migration/heating rates, which imply that some moons formed long after their planets if the tidal $Q$ is constant. Instead, resonance locking predicts that the outward migration timescale $t_{\\rm tide}$ is nearly constant, such that the effective values of $Q$ were larger in the past. The consequence is that the orbital frequencies of inner moons have likely decreased by a factor of order unity over the lifetime of the solar system (see Figure \\ref{SatQevol}), allowing them to have migrated into mean motion resonances with one another, yet still to have formed coevally with Jupiter and Saturn.  We cannot disprove the hypothesis that Saturn's medium-sized inner moons formed after Saturn, but the current rapid migration does not require such a scenario. One possible problem with resonance locking is that it does not guarantee convergent migration of moons. Detailed planetary/tidal evolution models are needed to determine whether it can generally account for the moons' observed mean motion resonances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\n\nWe thank Burkhard Militzer, Carolyn Porco, Francis Nimmo, Yanqin Wu, Dong Lai, and Peter Goldreich for useful discussions.

We adopt the Saturn model shown in Figure 2 of \\cite{fuller:14}, which reproduces Saturn's mass, radius, spin frequency, and gravitational moment $J_2$. The most important feature of this model is that it contains a stably stratified region outside the core, at radii $0.1 \\lesssim r/R \\lesssim 0.4$, which supports the existence of gravity modes. \n\nTo calculate the oscillation modes of this model, we adopt the traditional approximation (see e.g., \\citealt{bildsten:96,lee:97}) to find the so-called Hough modes on the low $\\ell$ mode branches. The Hough modes calculated from the traditional approximation are composed of many spherical harmonic degrees $\\ell$. However, each branch of modes can be traced back to a single spherical harmonic degree $\\ell$ in the non-rotating limit, which we will refer to as as the $\\ell$ of each mode. The adiabatic mode frequencies and eigenfunctions are calculated with standard numerical methods (see \\citealt{fuller:14b} for more detailed description) and with the usual reflective boundary conditions. We normalize the modes via (c.f. \\citealt{schenk:02,lai:06}) the orthonomality condition\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 49283, "prevtext": "\nin the limit $t_{\\rm p} \\rightarrow \\infty$. For Mimas, $t_{\\rm tide} \\sim 1.5 \\, t_\\alpha$, but for Rhea, $t_{\\rm tide} \\sim 0.16 \\, t_{\\alpha}$. A resonance lock cannot persist indefinitely, as it requires $t_{\\rm tide} \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\Omega_{\\rm m} \\rightarrow 0$. As a moon migrates outward, the resonance lock will eventually break when the required mode amplitude becomes too large. This can occur due to non-linear effects, or because the stable fixed point disappears when it reaches the center of the resonant trough in Figure \\ref{SatQmodes} (i.e., the resonance saturates). For the g mode resonances shown in Figure \\ref{SatQmodes}, the modes are linear in the sense that fluid displacements are orders of magnitude smaller than their wavelengths. Resonant saturation could occur if the mode damping rates are a few orders of magnitude larger than those calculated in Appendix \\ref{damp}. We find this unlikely, given the long mode lifetimes of the f modes resonating with Saturn's rings \\citep{hedman:13}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.44]{SatQevol.pdf}\n\\end{center} \n\\caption{ \\label{SatQevol} \nEvolution of moon semi-major axes in the Saturn system, calculated by integrating orbital evolution equations backward from the present era at $t \\simeq 4.5 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$.

For a constant $Q$, the tidal migration timescale for a moon of a given mass is a very strong function of semi-major axis (see Figure \\ref{SatQmodes}), such that $t_{\\rm tide} \\propto a^{13/2}$ (see equation \\ref{qdef}). This has created problems for conventional tidal theories, because it implies that outward migration rates were much faster in the past, thereby requiring large values of $Q$ (and correspondingly slow present-day outward migration) in order for the moons to have migrated to their current positions if they formed coevally with Saturn. However, the measured values of $Q$ are much smaller than the lower limits described by \\cite{peale:80}, implying such rapid past migration (in a constant $Q$ scenario) that the moons could not have formed at the same time as Saturn. Studies which have assumed constant values of $Q$ for Saturn in order to constrain the orbital evolution history (e.g., \\citealt{peale:80,meyer:07,meyer:08,zhang:09}) should be interpreted with caution.\n\nFigure \\ref{SatQevol} demonstrates the qualitative nature of orbital evolution assuming the effective value of $Q$ measured by \\cite{lainey:15} is constant in time. Here, we have integrated equation \\ref{qdef} backward in time for each moon, finding that the orbital semi-major axis decreases to zero in less than the age of the solar system. In other words, the moons must have formed billions of years after Saturn to be compatible with the theory of a constant tidal $Q$. Although this scenario has been proposed \\citep{charnoz:11,crida:12,asphaug:13}, we find the resonance locking solution described below to be simpler. \n\nIn contrast to constant tidal $Q$ models, resonance locking predicts that $t_{\\rm tide}$ {\\it increases} at small orbital distances (see equation \\ref{ttiderl}) where orbital frequencies are higher, for a constant value of $t_\\alpha$. The corresponding values of $Q$ (see equation \\ref{qdef}) are much larger because of the $Q \\propto a^{-13/2}$ scaling for a constant $t_{\\rm tide}$. Hence, the effective values of $Q$ for the moons were likely much larger in the past than they are at present, resolving the incompatibility of the small measured values of $Q$ with the age of the solar system. This is demonstrated in Figure \\ref{SatQevol}, where we integrate equation \\ref{ttiderl} backward in time for each moon, using $t_\\alpha = 50 \\, {\\rm Gyr}$. We caution that the value of $t_\\alpha$ may also have been smaller in the past, somewhat offsetting the orbital frequency dependence of equation \\ref{ttiderl}, and a detailed orbital evolution should take both these effects into account. \n\n\nNote also that resonance locking entails the effective values of $Q$ may vary by orders of magnitude over time, depending on whether a given moon is in a resonance lock. Each moon may have spent large amounts of time not involved in resonance locks and migrating outwards on long timescales, until eventually encountering a resonance and migrating outwards more rapidly (or being pushed outward by a MMR). \n\nA potential problem with resonance locking is that it does not always guarantee convergent orbital migration for two moons. For a constant $t_\\alpha$, equation \\ref{ttiderl} implies a shorter migration timescale for outer moons. If two moons are both caught in a resonance lock with the same $t_\\alpha$, the inner moon will not catch up to the outer moon to establish a MMR. Similarly, if an outer moon is pushed outward by a MMR such that it passes through a mode resonance, it could lock into resonance with the mode and escape the MMR. This could explain how Rhea was able to escape MMRs with other inner moons of Saturn; it simply migrated outward faster. However, the observed MMRs of inner moons require explanation. It is not expected that $t_\\alpha$ is exactly the same for all modes, and it is possible that some inner moons have locked into resonance with modes with low values of $t_\\alpha$ such that they migrate out faster. Since the mode density of our model is higher near inner moons (see Figure \\ref{SatQmodes}), the inner moons may have had more chances to lock with low $t_\\alpha$ modes. A more detailed planetary thermal evolution model would be required to investigate this possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Tidal Heating}\n\nIn Appendix \\ref{heat}, we calculate the tidal heating of moons implied by resonance locking. As in conventional tidal theories, the outward migration does not induce tidal heating in a moon unless the moon's eccentricity is increased due to a MMR, leading to heat deposition by eccentricity tides. In this case, the equilibrium tidal heating rate of the inner moon (assuming no tidal migration of the outer moon) is\n\n", "index": 47, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eheateq}\n\\dot{E}_{\\rm heat,1} \\simeq \\frac{1}{j-1} \\frac{|E_{2,{\\rm orb}}|}{t_{\\rm tide}} \\, .\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E24.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\dot{E}_{\\rm heat,1}\\simeq\\frac{1}{j-1}\\frac{|E_{2,{\\rm orb}}|}{t_{\\rm tide}}\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>E</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mrow><mi>heat</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>\u2243</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>orb</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>tide</mi></msub></mfrac></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05804.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 59281, "prevtext": "\n\nUsing $t_{\\rm tide}=35\\,{\\rm Gyr}$ for Enceladus (see Figure \\ref{SatQ}), we calculate its equilibrium heating rate to be $\\dot{E}_{\\rm heat} \\approx 50 \\, {\\rm GW}$.
